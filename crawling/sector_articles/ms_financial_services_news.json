			"<span class=\"speaker\">MARC ROWAN:</span> People are actually going to need to figure out how to be good investors going forward. And we have not yet mentally adjusted. What happened over the last 10 years is abnormal.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">KATIE KOCH:</span> One of my main takeaways is that people look a little too happy for me here. We're a little bit more pessimistic about the global outlook. And I'm struck by the fact that I think sentiment's actually still relatively positive here.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">DAVID HUNT:</span> Our view remains that, at the moment, the markets are overoptimistic around where we're headed with both rates and recession. And what I mean by that is that, actually, they're underestimating the strength of the American economy, which actually is in very good shape. The consumer is continuing to spend.",
			"You know, early days, they spend money on goods. Now they're spending money on services. But the economy is actually doing pretty well. That's the good news. The bad news is that means the Fed's going to have to do more to begin to slow aggregate demand.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">KATIE KOCH:</span> My main message to you would be that our outlook is more negative going forward than probably consensus, and more people need to catch up with us, which means that we're probably going to have more volatility and more drawdowns ahead of us.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Are you still seeing the appetite for ESG research, ESG knowledge, let's say, three years into all this interest really exploding into the scene?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JEFF SOLOMON:</span> I do. Like, it's not going away. Like, you know, like, most markets, right, people can get ahead of themselves and overpromise and underdeliver. I think ESG is true also. Like, we're going to be-- there's going to be a big global push to be carbon neutral by 2050.",
			"It's hard to argue that we're-- that the world isn't heading towards a more carbon-neutral state of being. And so we want to be there at the forefront of that to help clients figure out what's real, what's not real, who's actually doing things versus who's just saying they're doing things.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JENNY JOHNSON:</span> I think the traditional model that an investor built is now going to be challenged a bit as you take-- as you leverage AI to be able to find, sort of, unique insights.

This weekend was the first time I covered it in person. So a lot surprised me.",
			"Surprise number one: Warren Buffett casually strolling up to the Dairy Queen booth on Friday to chat up employees. Sure, the guy owns Dairy Queen and its 7,300 global restaurants (that store count number also surprised me) — but he is 92 years old. Shouldn't he have been resting up for Saturday's all-day question marathon instead of angling for a Dilly Bar?",
			"I guess not.",
			"Surprise number two: how deeply Warren Buffett is etched into the souls of his investors.",
			"I got the sense from talking to one Berkshire shareholder he would jump in front of a speeding car to save Buffett.",
			"Another brought his young son to Omaha and asked him to write down potential \"cheap\" investments from his environment (love to see it...I told him to use Yahoo Finance). Why? It's because the value-focused Warren Buffett would approve.",
			"Hard to argue with that type of father/son field trip.",
			"Surprise number three: how simple this event is, yet so complicated.",
			"Buffett and Munger sat once more at their long buffet table cloaked in a black tablecloth eating See's Candies. Simple. Buffett gave a meandering answer to why Geico is lagging the operating performance of key rivals. Complicated.",
			"It's just different being here at Buffettpalooza in person than covering the action at home, like I have done the past 15 years or so.",
			"But out of all the surprises, it was what I learned talking to the CEOs of household name Berkshire owned subsidiaries Dairy Queen, Brooks Running and See's Candies: All three of them now report to Buffett's handpicked successor Greg Abel amid the transition in power.",
			"I didn't realize that had happened so quickly after Abel was called out as the successor in 2021. NetJets CEO Adam Johnson also reports to Abel, I found out.",
			"And the CEOs had great things to say about Abel as a human and a manager.",
			"\"Neither one of us are worried,\" Buffett said on the topic of succession when asked a question at the event. Succession was a central focus throughout the Saturday gathering — well, that and products from Berkshire's top stock holding, Apple.",
			"But the bottom line is that Buffett and Munger are legends of the investing and business world. I didn't get the same star-struck vibe from those Berkshire managers when discussing Abel. That's nothing against Greg, it just underscores it's likely to be a different life for Berkshire post-Buffett and Munger.",
			"I also found it interesting to see NetJets pilots picketing outside the CHI Health Center on Saturday. A spokesperson told me the pilots aren't happy with their \"unfair\" contract. Thus far, the spokesperson said, Abel has has been unresponsive.",
			"In the end, will Abel get the first phone call on a whale deal? Will Abel be allowed to have quarterly shortfalls simply because he once sat next to Buffett and Munger on stage? Will there even be a Berkshire annual meeting in its current form - 40,000 people lined up to hear Abel discuss Burlington Northern profit margins? Will employees in the lower rungs of Berkshire trust Abel like they trust Warren?",
			"I don't have the answer to any of those questions. Soon, we will begin to find out.",
			"For one more weekend, however, investors got to celebrate the very best in the investing game. And this New Yorker got to finally try See's Candies. Take the wins where you can get them.",

		"content": [
			"(Bloomberg) -- Aramco plans an additional dividend, potentially raising payouts for investors and Saudi Arabia’s government just as weaker oil prices edge the kingdom’s budget into a deficit.",
			"The move could increase Aramco’s dividend — which at $75.8 billion last year was already the highest of any listed firm — by more than $20 billion in 2023, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. RBC Capital Markets LLC forecasts an increment of $12 billion to $18 billion.",
			"The stock surged as much as 7.2% in early trading, before trimming gains to 3.2%, still taking it to the highest level since September.",
			"Aramco increased dividends by 4% in March and said it wanted to continue growing them over the coming years. It has come under pressure to pay more to boost the attractiveness of the stock relative to those of rivals such as BP Plc and Shell Plc, which have been shelling out billions more to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.",
			"The new “performance-linked dividends” will be calculated as 50%-70% of Saudi Aramco’s annual free cash flow, net of the base payout and external investments, the world’s largest energy company said on Tuesday, shortly before it released earnings. The amount will be “determined with the annual results.”",
			"Low Liquidity",
			"“We have been deleveraging for some time and now we’re comfortable enough to introduce a mechanism that increases dividends in a way that shares the upside,” Chief Financial Officer Ziad Al Murshed said on a call with analysts.",
			"He also hopes it will increase the “relatively low” liquidity in the stock, which only has a free float of 2%. That’s “certainly front and center” of what Aramco is looking at, he said.",
			"The new payouts may increase Aramco’s dividend yield to around 4.2%, according to RBC, putting it more in line with peers.",
			"The Saudi Arabian government directly owns 90% Aramco, with a further 8% held by the sovereign wealth fund. The stock is now up 15% this year in Riyadh, outperforming that of Western Big Oil firms such as Shell and Exxon Mobil Corp.",
			"The country’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, has said the government may sell more shares in Aramco through a secondary offering.",
			"Aramco made a net profit of $31.9 billion for the first quarter, slightly below analysts’ expectations and down 19% from a year earlier. Free cash flow was $30.9 billion and the quarterly dividend was maintained at $19.5 billion.",
			"The gearing ratio, a measure of net debt to equity, fell further into negative territory, reflecting improved finances. It dropped to -10.3% from -7.9% in December.",
			"The firm’s free cash flow soared to almost $150 billion last year as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine roiled energy markets and pushed oil above $125 a barrel. That meant Aramco easily covered its annual dividend, a crucial source of funding for the Saudi government.",
			"The kingdom reported a $770 million fiscal deficit for the first quarter as spending on public sector salaries and massive projects to diversify the economy from energy increased. Growth slowed to 3.9% year-on-year, compared with 10% at the start of 2022.",
			"Oil prices have dipped sharply since the middle of last year after the global economy weakened and central banks raised interest rates to combat inflation. Brent averaged $82 a barrel between January and March. The benchmark has since fallen further to around $76.",
			"“The markets overreacted,” Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser said, reiterating that oil demand will rise 2% this year to a record of around 102 million barrels a day, with China and India continuing to show strong growth.",
			"Aramco, based in Dhahran in eastern Saudi Arabia, is targeting capital expenditure of $45 billion to $55 billion for 2023. It’s spending billions of dollars to raise its daily oil-production capacity to 13 million barrels from 12 million by 2027, and its gas output by more than 50% this decade.",
			"Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, has criticized Western companies for not investing more in fossil fuels and for trying to transition to cleaner forms of energy too quickly. While Aramco is also putting money into solar and hydrogen, it says fossil fuels will be needed for decades to ensure the world has secure and affordable energy.",
			"“We believe oil and gas will remain critical,” said Nasser.",
			"Still, much of Aramco’s spending is focused on petrochemicals in Asia. The company believes the use of plastics, paint and fertilizers — often made from crude-based chemicals — will rise over the coming decades. Selling more petrochemicals could protect it against any slowing of demand for gasoline and diesel as electric vehicles become more popular.",
			"Aramco bought 10% of Rongsheng Petrochemical Co., one of China’s refining giants, for $3.6 billion in March, a move that will expand its presence in the world’s biggest energy importer. That deal and another to invest in a new $12 billion refining and petrochemical plant in the northeastern province of Liaoning could see the company eventually ship nearly 700,000 barrels of additional oil a day to China for conversion into chemicals.",
			"“Our global downstream strategy is gaining momentum,” Nasser said.",
			"The downstream unit, responsible for fuel distribution and trading as well as refining and chemicals, made a pretax profit of $3.4 billion in the first quarter, down 67% from the same period of 2022. That was mainly due to a fall in chemicals margins.",
			"The unit is still dwarfed by the upstream, or production, unit, which generated earnings of $57 billion.",
			"Aramco, which produces all the oil in Saudi Arabia, pumped 10.4 million barrels a day of crude between January and March. That figure will probably drop in the second quarter because OPEC+ — an alliance led by Saudi Arabia and Russia — announced supply cuts. The Saudis are meant to lower output by 500,000 barrels a day from this month.",

			"(Bloomberg) -- Investors are watching Washington with a keen eye as President Joe Biden hosts House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other congressional leaders at the White House on Tuesday in a bid to resolve the ongoing impasse over the US debt ceiling and avoid a potentially catastrophic technical default.",
			"Tuesday marks the first of seven days in May when both chambers of Congress are available and Biden is also scheduled to be in the US capital, meaning it’s the beginning of a potentially narrow window to strike a deal before the early-June danger period for default risk. The Biden- McCarthy meeting is their first in three months and comes after both have dug ever-more-firmly into their respective positions. Ahead of the meeting both McCarthy and the White House pushed back against the idea of implementing a short-term extension to the ceiling.",
			"Treasury-bill markets have started to factor in the risks of non-payment from next month onward after both Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office warned last week that there’s a risk the government could exhaust borrowing capacity as soon as early June. The cost of insuring against a US default through derivatives has also rocketed higher in recent weeks.",
			"But the broader market impact of debt-cap concerns has remained relatively muted, with stock and bond investors having been more focused on recession risks, Federal Reserve policy and concerns about the health of America’s regional banks.",
			"Yellen said Sunday there are “simply no good options” for solving the debt-limit stalemate in Washington other than Congress lifting the cap. She also cautioned that invoking the 14th Amendment — which states that the validity of US debt shall not be questioned and is seen by some as invalidating the concept of the debt ceiling — would provoke a constitutional crisis.",
			"Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell warned he won’t come to Biden’s rescue by breaking the partisan deadlock, saying there’s no “ secret plan” and the White House has to figure it out with Speaker McCarthy.",
			"Meanwhile, former Biden administration economic adviser Daleep Singh said a financial-market shock is what’s required to motivate politicians to break the current impasse on the debt limit.",
			"From Washington to Wall Street, here’s what to watch to gauge how worried observers should be and when they should be concerned.",
			"X-Date Predictions",
			"Underpinning the various moves in debt markets are differing estimates about when the government might exhaust its options to fund itself — commonly referred to as the X-date. While the administration itself has provided guidance that it might fall short as soon as June, prognosticators across Wall Street have also been busy running the numbers based on government cash flows and expectations around tax and spending. Some strategists have pulled forward their estimates to align more with forecasts out of Washington. Others, meanwhile, are staying with their late-summer estimate, although recent cash flows from the Treasury suggest that it’s even more uncertain whether it will make it until June 15, a key tax payment day. Morgan Stanley strategists said the outlook for the X-date is likely to remain ``highly uncertain’’ over the next two to three weeks.",
			"Related story on Yellen’s warning to Congress about hitting the limit",
			"The Bills Curve",
			"Investors have historically demanded higher yields on securities that are due to be repaid shortly after the US is seen as running out of borrowing capacity. That puts a lot of focus on the yield curve for bills — the shortest-dated Treasury securities --and potential dislocations that show up. Noticeable upward distortions in particular parts of the curve tend to suggest increased concern among investors that that’s the time Uncle Sam might be at risk of default and right now that’s most prominent around early June. The government on Monday sold $57 billion of three-month securities — that are scheduled to mature on Aug. 10 — at 5.14%. That’s the highest auction yield for that particular benchmark bill since January 2001.",
			"Those kind of yields are, of course, tempting for investors who reckon such a premium is unwarranted because the debt-cap impasse will be resolved.

			"Beyond T-bills, one other key market to watch for insight on ceiling risks is what happens in credit default swaps for the US government. Those instruments, which act as insurance for investors in cases of non-payment, have continued to lurch to new highs. The cost to insure US debt is now higher than for some emerging markets, which have traditionally been a riskier proposition. Despite these market moves though, the prospect of a US stumble is still for many something close to unthinkable. Analysts at money manager Janus Henderson have put the probability of an outright US default at less than 1%.",

			"The US government’s ability to pay its debts and meet its spending obligations ultimately comes down to whether it has the cash to do it, so the amount sitting in its checking account is crucial. That figure ebbs and flows from day to day depending on spending, tax receipts, debt repayments and the proceeds of new borrowing. And if it gets too close to zero for the Treasury department’s comfort that could be a problem.",

And while more than half of prospective homebuyers surveyed (55%) believe the market is more competitive than last year, just as many (54%) plan to either speed up their home purchases or buy when they originally planned, including 62% of Gen Z and 55% of Millennial homebuyers.",
			"Yet not all prospective buyers are jumping in. Two in five surveyed Americans (39%) believe this is a seller's market, while 18% say it's a buyer's market and 31% say it's neither. Buying challenges included high prices and interest rates (51%); lack of cash reserves for down payments (37%); and low credit scores (37%). Still, nearly 40% of those prospective homebuyers said they feel more confident in their ability to buy a home today versus last year, compared to 26% who are less confident and 28% who feel about the same.",
			"\"The market is less frenzied as rates have moderated, and that may be impacting perception,\" said <span class=\"xn-person\">Matt Vernon</span>, head of retail lending at Bank of America. \"And low inventory is still creating a highly competitive environment.

Despite their younger age, 56% of Gen Z and 56% of surveyed Millennial homeowner hopefuls plan to purchase in the next two years – nearly on par with Gen X (58%). Nearly half (47%) of all prospective buyers say they would buy a home in the current housing market because they are tired of renting and of rent increases, and 28% want to start building equity.",
			"Prospective buyers said they'd be willing to put up to 25% of their monthly income toward mortgage payments for a starter home and 30% for a forever home, compared to the 29% they'd be willing to put toward monthly rent. Most prospective buyers plan to purchase a home with a spouse or partner (55%) while 38% say they're planning to go it alone.",
			"<b>Real Estate Curiosity Keeping Those on the Sidelines Active</b>",
			"Even hopeful buyers who may be waiting for the housing market to cool are still forging ahead in their own way. More than two-thirds (67%) of prospective buyers are actively looking at homes for sale – whether they're scrolling through a real estate marketplace app with a certain budget in mind (52%) and/or visiting open house events for fun (31%).",
			"Those scanning for homes find it to be an enjoyable pastime (41%), a way to dream about their future home (37%) and a window into how others have decorated their spaces (32%). Beyond simply looking for inspiration, two-thirds (65%) of those who scroll through listings are interested in what their current budget would get them if they were to buy today.",
			"Talking with friends and family can also provide first-hand accounts of potential hurdles and valuable resources during the homebuying journey. Most people surveyed say they are comfortable talking with friends about how they came up with their down payment (82%), but only 17% have directly asked a friend how they were able to afford the upfront costs. The sharing of information can be invaluable as only 39% of prospective buyers know how to find down payment assistance programs.",

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Mastercard Inc., The Coca-Cola Co. and T-Mobile US, Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.<br/><br/>You can <strong>see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong><br/><br/><strong>Mastercard</strong> shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+18.0% vs. +10.2%). The company's numerous acquisitions are helping it to grow addressable markets and drive new revenue streams. We expect the company's top line at $25.2 billion in 2023. The COVID-19 crisis accelerated the adoption of digital and contactless solutions, providing an opportunity for MA's business to expedite its shift to the digital mode.<br/><br/>Mastercard is well-poised to gain from steady cash-generating abilities. A strong capital position allows it to pursue acquisitions and prudently deploy capital.<br/><br/>However, steep operating expenses might stress margins. High rebates and incentives may weigh on the company's net revenues. Its dividend yield is still lower than the industry average. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.<br/><br/>(You can <strong>read the full research report on Mastercard here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br/><br/>Shares of <strong>Coca-Cola</strong> have gained +1.4% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry's gain of +10.3%. The company's earnings and sales improved year over year and surpassed the Zacks analyst estimates in the quarter. KO's results benefited from the continued momentum in its business.<br/><br/>Sales gained from revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and a rise in concentrate sales.

			"With many of the world’s central banks exploring the value of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), Visa and its partners have demonstrated how CBDCs can enable new cross-border payments programmatically, as well as provide international investment resources to SMEs. The programmable aspects of digital currencies, which allow delivery and payment of assets and currencies to be automatically settled only when certain conditions are met, open the door for more efficient capital usage and reduced counterparty risks, while leveraging the security, stability, and safety of a central bank liability via CBDC as a reliable settlement currency.",
			"The prototype platform brings existing financial processes and assets on-chain, allowing farmers to tokenize traditional financing contracts. To achieve this, Agrotoken brought its agriculture-based tokenization expertise from their existing solutions in Brazil and Latin America and Visa delivered a tokenization process for turning existing Brazilian legal documents into an on-chain tradeable NFT.",
			"\"Agrotoken has a mission to democratize agribusiness by making transactions with soy and corn more accessible. To achieve this, we have chosen solid partners, such as Visa, to join us in our journey towards this goal,\" said Anderson Nacaxe, Director of Agrotoken in Brazil.",
			"Combined with tokenization, Visa implemented a new onchain sealed-bid auction mechanism through smart contracts to enable a global pool of investors on the blockchain to participate in the financing process, achieving competitive price discovery.

			"Berkshire managers who have been reporting to Abel instead of Buffett since 2018 said they're confident and impressed with his ability to oversee dozens of different businesses as varied as Israeli tookmaker Iscar Metalworking, industrial conglomerate Marmon Holdings, jeweler Helzberg Diamonds and the NetJets private jet service.",
			"Dairy Queen CEO Troy Bader said that whenever he has any issues related to the brand, Abel is always available, and he reaches out if he ever has any questions. Bader said he's not sure where Abel “gets all the time in the day, but his access has been terrific.”",
			"“Greg is a very quick study. He understands the businesses quickly and he’s going to challenge us, as you would expect any really good manager to do,” he said.",
			"Buffett is clearly a tough act to follow after leading Berkshire for 58 years and earning a reputation as one of the best investors ever, but Bader said there is a lot of talent among Berkshire's other managers.",
			"“Obviously Berkshire has never known anything other than Warren and Charlie very well involved,” Bader said. “But having had the privilege of getting to know so many of the other leaders, Berkshire’s in very capable hands, and that’s a credit again to Warren.”",
			"Buffett and Abel joked during a CNBC interview earlier this spring that Abel might even be able to get more out of Berkshire's businesses because he doesn't the history of having acquired them and may ask tougher questions as he gets to know the companies better. But just like Buffett, Abel largely lets the businesses run themselves, talking strategy with them periodically and offering advice whenever they need it. But the CEOs of each Berkshire business make the day-to-day decision except that they'll run any big spending decisions past headquarters.",
			"Brooks Running CEO Jim Weber said Abel approaches the businesses with the background of an operator who helped build the Berkshire Hathaway Energy utility unit as opposed to Buffett's background as an investor. Abel may even direct a few more pointed questions about Brooks' competition to Weber because unlike Buffett, Abel is a runner who wants to try on the shoes not just talk numbers. But he still provides similar oversight.",
			"“We definitely see he’s got he’s got the brain of an operator. And so in that sense, there is a different slate of questions that are, I think, more in tune with business topics and issues,” Weber said. “But at the end of the day, you know, the relationship is, is still kind of working the same for us.”",
			"See's Candy Pat Egan said shareholders should know that Abel is remarkable in his own right.",
			"“Greg’s singularly talented. He’s an amazing guy,” Egan said. “So in terms of leadership, we have no, no concerns whatsoever.”"

			"(Reuters) - One of the biggest hits from the just-concluded annual love fest for Warren Buffett showed the enduring popularity of the investing legend: plush, squishy toys featuring the billionaire and his business partner Charlie Munger.",
			"On Friday, the start of Berkshire Hathaway Inc's three-day shareholder weekend, thousands thronged a convention hall in downtown Omaha, Nebraska, for five hours to buy discounted products from many Berkshire-owned brands.",
			"For many, the $9.99 Squishmallows featuring Buffett and Munger, made by Berkshire's recently acquired toy company Jazwares, were the must-have memento.",
			"Omaha police cut off a long line to buy them two hours early. \"No more sales,\" one officer said.",
			"Michelle Young, of Cottonwood, Arizona, who once ran a pottery studio, was able to snag a pair, saying she was \"fascinated by Warren and Charlie.\"",
			"About 10,000 Buffett and Munger Squishmallows were sold, and by Monday they were fetching as much as $255 at auction on eBay.",
			"Jazwares, whose former parent Alleghany Corp was acquired by Berkshire in October, declined to comment on secondary sales. EBay Inc did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
			"Those who traveled to Omaha for the weekend included many first-timers as well as others who have gone for decades.",
			"Many said they were anxious to see Buffett and Munger - who are 92 and 99, respectively - while they still could. Some pledged to return even after they are no longer around or if the events are pared back.",
			"'ONE IN A TRILLION'",
			"On Saturday, Buffett and Munger appeared before a full house in the city's 18,300-seat downtown arena. Thousands of shareholders lined up hours before doors opened at 7 a.m. to see them.",
			"\"They're old, and I want to see them once in my life,\" said Ziyi Ruan from Shanghai, who works in marketing for an electric-vehicle company, and said he arrived at 2 a.m.",

			"Cissy Zhang, a business consultant from Madison, Wisconsin, attending with her 5-year-old son and her parents, who both flew in from China, said she would attend \"at least one more time. To operate this whole thing is teamwork. It's not just one man.\"",
			"Richard Callahan, a local banker, expects attendance to drop without what he called the \"panache\" of Buffett and Munger, but said he will still go.",
			"But while shareholders expressed comfort in Berkshire's long-term planning, many were skeptical when asked if the weekend would remain a big draw without Buffett, Munger or both.",
			"\"No,\" said Bill Smead, who runs Smead Capital Management in Phoenix. \"These two guys were one in a trillion.\"",
			"Berkshire declined to comment on Monday.",
			"'CONTAGIOUS' ENTHUSIASM",
			"For decades, Berkshire has been planning for the eventuality when Buffett, who has run the company since 1965 and Munger, a vice chairman since 1978, are no longer there.",
			"Greg Abel, who oversees non-insurance operations, is slated to become chief executive, while Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who handle some investments, could take over all of them.",
			"Ajit Jain would keep oversight of insurance. And Buffett's eldest son, Howard, would become nonexecutive chairman.",
			"At Saturday's meeting, Buffett and Munger discussed among many topics how mismanagement and greed were causes of this year's banking-sector turmoil.",
			"They also agreed that artificial intelligence could disrupt many industries - though Munger said \"old-fashioned intelligence\" worked well too.",
			"\"You come to hear the same wonderful message and receive a refresher and right-set your mind,\" said Mark Blakley, a Tulsa, Oklahoma, corporate benefits supervisor at his 14th meeting.",
			"First-time attendee Jennifer Koon, a public relations executive from Roswell, Georgia, plans to return.",
			"\"The culture among short and long-term attendees was enviable and their enthusiasm contagious,\" she said in an email on Sunday. \"I'd challenge you to find that kind of loyalty among owners of other stocks.\"",

			"Net income was nearly $1.25 billion in the first quarter, compared with $1.37 billion year over year.",
			"Total revenues were $6 billion, up 1% from $5.97 billion a year ago. Of that, freight revenues were $5.75 billion, up 2.2% from nearly $5.63 billion in the first quarter of 2022.",
			"BNSF attributed the revenue increase to a 14% gain on average revenue per car/unit that came from higher fuel surcharge revenue. Increased rates per car also helped.",
			"Breaking down freight revenues by segment, BNSF’s consumer products revenues fell 10% to nearly $1.87 billion on a 16% decrease in volumes. That volume decline was primarily due to lower intermodal shipments, which stemmed from lower West Coast imports, as well as the loss of an intermodal customer, BNSF said. However, an increase in automotive volume due to higher vehicle production partially offset the volume loss of the overall segment.",
			"Agricultural products revenue rose 9% to nearly $1.48 billion despite a 2% decrease in volumes. Lower grain exports put pressure on agricultural products volumes, although higher volumes of domestic grains, renewable diesel and feedstock partially offset this decline.",
			"Industrial products revenue grew 6% to $1.38 billion despite a 4% decrease in volumes due to lower demand for chemicals and plastics, lumber, and paper shipments, BNSF said.",
			"Coal revenues increased 16% to $1.03 billion despite a 4% decline in volumes. The drop in volumes was primarily due to weather-related impacts and moderating demand due to lower natural gas prices, according to BNSF.",
			"Meanwhile, operating income was $1.9 billion, down 9% year over year from $2.04 billion. Operating ratio, a metric that investors sometimes use to gauge the financial health of a company, was 68.4%, compared with 64.6% last year. A lower OR can imply improved financial health.",
			"And expenses grew 6% to $4.16 billion owing to several factors, according to BNSF: a 12% growth in fuel expenses, a 7% increase in compensation and benefits expenses due to increased head count, wage inflation and lower productivity, and a 22% increase in materials and other expenses due to inflation, increased casualty and litigation costs, and higher property and miscellaneous taxes.",

			"Attorneys for Javice and JPMorgan Chase held a call Monday with Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick, the Delaware Chancery Court judge overseeing the case, who ruled for the entrepreneur, executives said. Judge <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:McCormick;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://fortune.com/company/mccormick/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">McCormick</a> concluded that JPMorgan Chase was legally obligated to cover Javice’s legal bills, Bloomberg <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:reported;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-08/jpmorgan-ordered-to-pay-javice-s-legal-fees-in-frank-fraud-case?srnd=all&amp;sref=7H70AtGu\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a>.",
			"JPMorgan Chase must also pay the legal fees of Olivier Amar, Frank’s chief growth officer, who also sued the bank to cover his legal fees.",
			"“We continue to focus on the main issue of addressing our fraud claims against Ms. Javice and Mr. Amar through the legal process,” said Pablo Rodriguez, a spokesman for JPMorgan Chase.",
			"A Javice spokesman declined to comment.",
			"For months, Javice has been waiting for Judge St. Jude McCormick to decide if JPMorgan Chase must pay her legal fees. Javice sold her financial aid startup Frank to JPMorgan Chase in September 2021 for $175 million. That month, she joined the bank as a managing director, head of student solutions, but was placed on administrative leave in September 2022, and was fired the following November, according to JPMorgan Chase and Javice legal documents.",
			"In December, Javice sued the bank in Delaware Chancery Court, claiming JPMorgan Chase terminated her employment at Frank without cause and should be required to pay her legal fees, costs, and expenses, according to her <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:claim;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Javice-12-23-22-Public-Version-of-Verified-Complaint-for-Advancement-Court-Stamped-00845279xACD46-1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claim</a> against the bank. Just days later, JPMorgan Chase sued Javice in Delaware District Court, alleging the entrepreneur lied about the number of customers Frank had when the bank acquired the company. Javice allegedly told JPMorgan Chase that Frank had 4.25 million customers, but in reality, the company had about 300,000, according to JPMorgan Chase’s <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:version of events;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66678711/1/jpmorgan-chase-bank-na-v-javice/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">version of events</a> as spelled out in legal documents. Amar, who was fired by JPMorgan in October 2022, sued the bank in January to have them cover his legal fees.",
			"Javice’s legal bills have mounted since then. In April, federal prosecutors arrested the entrepreneur, and she was released on a $2 million bond. The Department of Justice <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:filed criminal charges;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/1577861/download\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">filed criminal charges</a> against her, charging Javice with separate counts of conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, according to the lawsuit. She was also charged with one count of securities fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The Securities and Exchange Commission, in a separate lawsuit, also charged Javice with fraud for making “numerous misrepresentations” about Frank’s users.",
			"Last week, the DOJ revealed that Javice was in talks with the U.S. attorney’s office for a “possible disposition” of the case. This means the parties are working on a resolution, which could involve a dismissal of the charges or a plea, a criminal attorney told <em>Fortune</em>.",
			"The fee verdict on Monday is a big win for Javice, who has been running out of money. The biggest source of Javice’s wealth was presumably her cut of the money she made from selling Frank for $175 million. After they arrested Javice in April, federal prosecutors seized Javice’s assets and blocked her from accessing them, according to an April 21 court filing from Javice. Certain financial institutions have frozen Javice’s bank accounts, including her brokerage account that contained a majority of her available funds, said Michael Barlow, an attorney with law firm Abrams &amp; Bayliss, in an April 12 letter to Judge St. Jude <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:McCormick;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://fortune.com/company/mccormick/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">McCormick</a>. “As a result, Ms. Javice’s ability to access funds to enforce her advancement rights, to defend herself in the Delaware Federal Action, and to defend the DOJ and SEC Actions, has become imperiled,” Barlow said in the letter.",
			"If Javice had not won the ruling, she would have no way to pay for her attorneys and would be without legal representation, a person familiar with the situation said.",
			"The ruling is also the latest win for Alex Spiro, a partner at law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan, who is representing Javice. Spiro is known as Elon Musk’s personal attorney; he helped quash a 2019 defamation lawsuit against the billionaire when Musk called a British diver a “pedo guy” during a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Twitter;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://fortune.com/company/twitter/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> fight, the <em>Washington Post </em><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:reported;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/06/alex-spiro-musk-twitter-lawyer/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a>.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Mastercard Incorporated (MA), The Coca-Cola Company (KO) and T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.<br/><br/>You can <strong>see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong><br/><br/><strong>Mastercard</strong> shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+18.0% vs. +10.2%). Company’s numerous acquisitions are helping it to grow addressable markets and drive new revenue streams. We expect the company's top line at $25.2 billion in 2023. The COVID-19 crisis accelerated the adoption of digital and contactless solutions, providing an opportunity for MA's business to expedite its shift to the digital mode.<br/><br/>Mastercard is well-poised to gain from steady cash-generating abilities. A strong capital position allows it to pursue acquisitions and prudently deploy capital.<br/><br/>However, steep operating expenses might stress margins. High rebates and incentives may weigh on the company's net revenues. Its dividend yield is still lower than the industry average. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.<br/><br/>(You can <strong>read the full research report on Mastercard here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br/><br/>Shares of <strong>Coca-Cola</strong> have gained +1.4% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry’s gain of +10.3%. The company’s earnings and sales improved year over year and surpassed the Zacks analyst estimates in the quarter. KO’s results benefited from the continued momentum in its business.<br/><br/>Sales gained from revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and a rise in concentrate sales. It is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments. It provided an upbeat guidance for 2023.<br/><br/>However, shares of Coca-Cola lagged the industry in the past three months. Pressures from higher supply chain costs, higher marketing spends and currency headwinds are concerning.<br/><br/>(You can <strong>read the full research report on Coca-Cola here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br/><br/>Shares of <strong>T-Mobile US</strong> have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+18.0% vs. -4.8%). With industry-leading growth in postpaid and broadband customers driven by superior 5G network and focus on customers, T-Mobile reported solid first-quarter 2023 results driven by diligent execution of operational plans.<br/><br/>The company has augmented its 5G footprint by introducing 5G Home Internet services in several states. T-Mobile plans to reach 300 million people within 2023. It intends to bring more competition to home broadband, especially in underserved rural markets.<br/><br/>However, T-Mobile operates in a fiercely competitive and almost saturated U.S. telecom market, which lowers its growth potential to some extent. Several promotional activities to lure additional customers are further eroding profitability. Lower equipment revenues due to a challenging macroeconomic environment remain a concern. Debt obligation woes also persist.<br/><br/>(You can <strong>read the full research report on T-Mobile US here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br/><br/>Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Shopify Inc.

			"(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. must pay Frank founder Charlie Javice’s defense costs in its suit accusing her of defrauding the bank in its $175 million acquisition of her college-loan-planning site.",
			"Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick concluded Monday JPMorgan was legally obligated to cover Javice’s legal bills, rejecting the bank’s argument that her alleged fraud fell outside the scope of the 2021 merger agreement. The ruling likely also covers Javice’s defense to criminal fraud charges brought by federal prosecutors over the disputed deal.",
			"JPMorgan sued Javice and Olivier Amar, another Frank executive, for fraud in Delaware federal court in December, claiming they falsified records to show the site had more than four million customers when it actually had less than a tenth that number. JPMorgan has since shut down the Frank site.",
			"Javice and Amar both turned around and sued JPMorgan for legal fees in Delaware Chancery Court, saying they deserved coverage under the bank’s policies since they became JPMorgan employees after the buyout. The bank’s attorneys countered that the fraud allegations negated its obligations.",
			"While the merger agreement contained language addressing fraud, the contract language doesn’t create a “carve out” to deny Javice and Amar advancement of legal fees, the judge concluded.",
			"“We continue to focus on the main issue of addressing our fraud claims against Ms. Javice and Mr. Amar through the legal process,” Pablo Rodriguez, a bank spokesman, said in an emailed statement.",
			"Javice was charged with fraud by Manhattan federal prosecutors last month. She was also sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. She has yet to enter a plea in the criminal case, and her lawyers and prosecutors last week asked for the case to be delayed for talks between the two sides.",
			"McCormick also ordered JPMorgan to cover Amar’s legal fees for the same reasons the bank is on the hook for Javice’s bills. Amar, Frank’s growth and acquisition head, wasn’t named in either the criminal or SEC case.",
			"The bank urged McCormick to deny Javice and Amar’s legal fee requests, noting they’d reaped millions of dollars from the Frank sale that they could use to cover their own defense costs.",
			"McCormick’s ruling likely comes as a relief to Javice, who has run into money problems as she deals with JPMorgan’s fraud allegations.",
			"The entrepreneur moved millions of dollars out of JPMorgan after the bank fired her and accused her of fraud, but then wound up getting caught up in the collapse of Signature Bank. That institution was seized by state regulators in March after a run on the bank threatened its future. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. stepped in to insure Signature deposits.",
			"Seized Accounts",
			"Although she was able to move her money before regulators put Signature into receivership, her accounts later were seized by federal prosecutors who charged her with defrauding JPMorgan.",
			"JPMorgan suggested in Delaware court filings in Javice was trying to hide assets in Nevada shell companies she set up. But she countered the government’s seizure of her funds vitiated any such concern.",
			"If Javice is convicted of the fraud charges or she is found liable in JPMorgan’s lawsuit, the bank could seek to recoup any legal fees it advanced to her, said Larry Hamermesh, a retired University of Pennsylvania professor who taught about Delaware corporate law. Those outcomes could mean she no longer meant the standard to be indemnified by her former employer.",
			"“She’ll have to fork over the fees” in that event, Hamermesh said, “if she has the money, that is.”",
			"The case is Javice v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 2022-1179, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).",

			"<strong>Affirm Holdings, Inc. </strong>AFRM is set to report its third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on May 9, after the closing bell.",
			"The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fiscal 2023 loss per share of 91 cents suggests a 379% plunge from the prior-year loss of 19 cents. The estimate remained stable over the past week. The consensus estimate for third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues of $366.9 million indicates a 3.4% increase from the year-ago reported figure.",
			"Affirm beat on earnings in one of the trailing four quarters and missed thrice, the average negative surprise being 0.1%. This is depicted in the graph below.",
			"Affirm Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Affirm Holdings, Inc. Quote",
			"Before we get into what to expect for the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it’s worth taking a look at AFRM’s previous-quarter performance first.",
			"In the last reported quarter, this leading payment network’s adjusted loss per share of $1.10 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.9%, primarily due to increased operating costs. This was partially offset by growing transactions and a significant increase in servicing income.",
			"Now, let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings announcement.",
			"Resilient consumer spending in the March quarter despite inflationary pressures is expected to have benefited the payment solution provider. Travel and entertainment-related spending is expected to have risen in the quarter under review. This, in turn, is likely to have augmented the strength of active merchants and consumers.",
			"The sales figures from the virtual card networks are anticipated to have risen. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for virtual card network revenues is pegged at $25.8 million, indicating an 11.3% year-over-year rise.",
			"The consensus mark for interest income in the fiscal third quarter is pegged at $166.1 million, indicating a 23.4% jump from the previous fiscal-year quarter’s $134.6 million. These are expected to have positioned the company for year-over-year growth in the fiscal third-quarter top line.",
			"The positives are likely to have been partially offset by lower servicing income, merchant network revenues and higher operating costs. The consensus mark for servicing income indicates a 2.3% year-over-year fall. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for gain on sales of loans suggests a 10.1% year-over-year decline.",
			"Moreover, the consensus estimate for merchant network revenues is pegged at $111.4 million, indicating a decrease of 8% from a year ago. Reductions in the concentration of certain APR loans are expected to have affected the metric.",
			"Also, operating costs are likely to have increased in the quarter under review, affecting the bottom line. Higher processing and servicing costs, as a result of increased volumes, are anticipated to have boosted the operating costs, reducing profits and making an earnings beat uncertain.",
			"Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Affirm this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.",
			"<strong>Earnings ESP</strong>: The company currently has an Earnings ESP of -23.08%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate currently stands at a loss of $1.12 per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 91 cents.",
			"You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.",
			"<strong>Zacks Rank</strong>: Affirm currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.",
			"You can see <strong>the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.",
			"Here are some companies from the Business Services space that have already reported earnings for the March quarter. These include <strong>Mastercard Incorporated</strong> MA, <strong>Visa Inc.</strong> V and <strong>The Western Union Company</strong> WU.",
			"Mastercard reported first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of $2.80 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.3%. The quarterly results were driven by improved cross-border travel, coupled with an expanding payment network and value-added services and solutions. However, the upside was partly offset by the company’s escalating operating expense level.",
			"Visa reported second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings of $2.09 per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97. The quarterly results were aided by higher payments, and cross-border volumes and processed transactions. Steady cross-border travel growth and lower-than-expected client incentives aided the results, partially offset by higher costs.",
			"Western Union reported first-quarter 2023 earnings per share of 43 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 30.3%. WU’s earnings were supported by the strength witnessed in the Middle East business, Evolve 2025’s momentum, lower consumer acquisition costs and transaction growth. However, adverse currency impact, discontinuation of operations across Russia and Belarus and promotional pricing activities partially offset the positives.",

			"<span class=\"speaker\">-</span> Well, one other question rising from Berkshire Hathaway's annual meetup, who comes after Warren? Even as Buffett, among a whole cohort in Omaha, Nebraska, questions about their succession plans still linger. Is Greg Abel quite able to keep Berkshire investors calm about the future? Well, joining us now to discuss is Steven Check, Check Capital Management president and CIO. Good to have you on the show here. So I want to first start with your takeaways from Berkshire here. I mean, they covered a lot of ground here, US-China, Apple, AI as well, and even a little bit on the bank runs as well. But I want to first get your takeaways as well.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">STEVEN CHECK:</span> Well, it was a very uplifting meeting. Remember, this is kind of the first, like, real meeting since COVID, so since '19-- since 2019. And, you know, it's just really good to see the crowd back, not having to do vaccine checks coming through. It just-- and Warren Buffett himself seem just rejuvenated. It's like he almost went back and took a little bit of a speech class or something in the last couple of years. And there was-- the \"ums\" that were in the meetings the last couple of years just disappeared this year. It was just a really great vibe.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">-</span> And we have to talk US-China relations because that's something that, you know, we have commentary on. And when you think of some of the biggest holdings of Berkshire, we mentioned Apple there and really what's at stake here. Do you think that investors are going to heed that, though, and perhaps some of the powers that be in regulation would perhaps listen to this?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">STEVEN CHECK:</span> Well, I hope they would. You know, they try to say it generally, pretty diplomatically, Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger. With Charlie Munger, it's very-- very straight out there in what he believes. But this is very common sense type of stuff that they're usually talking about, and they try to put it in a way where it doesn't become politicized and people do listen to it. So I would hope so.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">-</span> And, of course, when you talk about Apple, then, also looking at the comparison with autos, we know that Berkshire was very hot on BYD, but then ended up selling half of its stake in the EV maker. As we try and sort go through the tea leaves here, what should we take from that?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">STEVEN CHECK:</span> Yeah. Well, they in general, don't like real capital-intensive businesses, where there's a high risk of who's going to be the winner. And they, of course, stated that clearly. And they behaved that way. BYD, I would say, is a bit of an exception.",
			"They-- Charlie Munger, especially, was just enamored with the CEO BYD and what he's done over the years. And it's been just-- it was a huge home run investment for Berkshire. So it certainly is something that worked out very well. But in general, they're not betting on car companies. I think, in this case, they were more or less betting on the CEO of a car company.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">-</span> And of course, Berkshire does have its favorite child in Apple. But even when you look at the rest of the portfolio, especially Geico and the turnaround story there, how surprising was that?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">STEVEN CHECK:</span> Well, Geico-- Geico was a nice turn, at least from the numbers. But things haven't completely turned at Geico. And it was really kind of refreshing to hear from not just Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett this weekend. We also heard from Ajit Jain about Geico. And he was very candid about the issues that still exist at Geico and hope to be kind of cleaned up maybe in another year and a half. So while Geico's a combined ratio look good this quarter, he did project that it's going to not be that good throughout the rest of this year. And they're just working their way back from kind of a little bit of a hole, technologically wise, that they got themselves into.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">-</span> And of course, we knew that the issue of succession would come up. I mean, we didn't hear a lot from Greg Abel and Ajit Jain. But I mean, we did hear more from them than we usually do at the meetings. Talk about that dynamic. We heard Warren Buffett say, you know, Greg Abel is going to be the man. But when they talked about this sort of bench of executives that could follow after them, he sort of dismissed that he called it baloney because there's a very specialized set of skills that you need to be able to run a company the size of Berkshire.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">STEVEN CHECK:</span> Well, something that you didn't see, unless you were at the meeting, was there's a movie that takes place before really the questions-and-answer period starts. And-- and in this movie, which lasts for about 20 minutes, they interspersed nine different clips of people asking questions about succession at Berkshire Hathaway. And these clips went back to 1994, 1995, 1996, early 2000s, and early 2010s.",
			"It's the same question, you know, what happens after, Warren Buffett, you're gone? And what's the risk and all that? And it's the same answer for nearly 30 years now. I mean, Berkshire Hathaway has a very deep culture, with a very huge number of talented managers. And they'd really just said, you know, it'll be-- it could be on autopilot for the next three or four years after Warren Buffett departs the scenes, and hardly anyone would notice.",
			"Now, Greg Abel is a very able man. And one of his main jobs will be capital allocation. And you can look at what he did, frankly, with his own money just in the last year. He bought Berkshire Hathaway stock, about $100 million of Berkshire Hathaway stock, with his own money. And he bought it at very succinct times last year when the stock was down around 275. And a little-- just about a month ago, it was just a little under 300. And now we're close to 330.",
			"He really picked some great points with his own personal money. And when he's in charge of Berkshire's money and looking at stock buybacks for Berkshire, for example, that's a big capital allocation decision. I'm sure he's going to do a great job.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">-</span> And you know we'll all be watching closely. A big thank you there to Steven Check, Check Capital Management president and CIO. Thank you for your time this morning."

The top line, however, rose 0.6% year over year on higher net investment income. Net investment income increased 47.2% year over year to $134 million, primarily attributable to an increase in income from fixed maturities due to improved yields.<br/><br/>Total expenses in the quarter under review increased 1.9% year over year to $1.14 billion, attributable to higher interest expense and financing costs. Pre-tax catastrophe and weather-related losses and net of reinsurance were $38 million, primarily attributable to New Zealand floods, Cyclone Gabrielle and other weather-related events.

			"When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?",
			"Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about <b>MasterCard</b> (MA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.",
			"MasterCard currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.21, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 24 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.21 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.",
			"Of the 24 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 20 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 83.3% and 12.5% of all recommendations.",
			"<b>Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MA</b>",
			"<br/><br/>Check price target &amp; stock forecast for MasterCard here&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/><br/>The ABR suggests buying MasterCard, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.",
			"Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.",
			"In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.",
			"With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.",
			"<b>Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR</b>",
			"Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.",
			"Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",
			"Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.",
			"In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.",
			"In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.",
			"There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.",
			"<b>Is MA Worth Investing In?</b>",
			"In terms of earnings estimate revisions for MasterCard, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 1% over the past month to $12.26.",
			"Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.",
			"The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for MasterCard. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;",
			"Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for MasterCard may serve as a useful guide for investors.",

			"(Bloomberg) -- The idea that banks are too big to fail needs to be reviewed in the wake of the recent turmoil that’s seen the collapse of four US lenders, including Silicon Valley Bank, according to Standard Chartered Plc Chief Executive Officer Bill Winters.",
			"“This whole too-big-to-fail question comes up again and again, but as we just saw a $250 billion bank named SVB was deemed too big to fail in a conventional resolution way, so this whole resolution concept of what is a too-big-to-fail bank is going to have to be reviewed,” Winters said during an on-stage interview at the Dubai Fintech Summit.",
			"When asked if JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. CEO Jamie Dimon was getting to “too big for his boots” after the largest US lender agreed to acquire First Republic Bank in a government-led deal, Winters said: “Of course not. JPMorgan’s deposit share is about 12% right now. In many countries around the world, leading banks have much more than 12%.”",
			"Winters said that even with JPMorgan handling that amount of deposits, the US is still a competitive market.",
			"“What regulators need to be careful about is the concentrated deposit market share in sub-markets such as the New York city region, Chicago and Los Angeles, but 12% is manageable,” he added.",
			"‘Super Strong’",
			"The US banking woes began with the liquidation of a small crypto-friendly lender in early March before it spread to engulf three other regional banks. Standard Chartered became a “net receiver of global deposits during this period of global angst,” Winters said, adding that the British lender has a “super strong” capital position.",
			"Winters said that the response by US regulators to provide access to funding for all of the nation’s banks was “perfect” but that the “ideal response” would have been to provide liquidity to the challenged banks before their demise.",
			"While the struggling lenders may have still collapsed, it could have been “in a more orderly way that wouldn’t have undermined confidence in the broader system,” according to Winters.",
			"“The fact is that you had solvent banks in the US and in Switzerland that died because they couldn’t get access to liquidity from anyone - not from their depositors or their central bank,” Winters said. “We have to ask the question why not. That’s an element of reform that’s been overlooked so far.”",

With 59% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).",
			"And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$221b last week after a 4.6% drop in the share price. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 22% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Often called “market makers”, institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Bank of America which might hurt individual investors.",
			"Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Bank of America, beginning with the chart below.",

			"Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.",
			"As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Bank of America. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Bank of America's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.",
			"Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Bank of America. The company's largest shareholder is Berkshire Hathaway Inc., with ownership of 13%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.6% and 5.9%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.",
			"On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.",
			"While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.",
			"The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.",
			"I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.",
			"Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Bank of America Corporation. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$415m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:see if those insiders have been buying or selling.;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/banks/nyse-bac/bank-of-america/ownership?blueprint=2499968&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=integrated-pitch&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> see if those insiders have been buying or selling. </a>",
			"The general public-- including retail investors -- own 28% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.",
			"We can see that public companies hold 13% of the Bank of America shares on issue. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.",
			"I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

			"Shares of this nation's second-largest bank have returned -0.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.2% change. The Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, to which Bank of America belongs, has gained 1.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?",
			"Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.",
			"<b>Earnings Estimate Revisions</b>",
			"Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.",
			"Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.",
			"Bank of America is expected to post earnings of $0.85 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3%.",
			"The consensus earnings estimate of $3.41 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +6.9%. This estimate has changed +3.1% over the last 30 days.",
			"For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.26 indicates a change of -4.2% from what Bank of America is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.8%.",
			"With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Bank of America.",
			"The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:",
			"<b>12 Month EPS</b>",
			"<b>Projected Revenue Growth</b>",
			"Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.",
			"For Bank of America, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $25.07 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $100.61 billion and $100.13 billion estimates indicate +6% and -0.5% changes, respectively.",
			"<b>Last Reported Results and Surprise History</b>",
			"Bank of America reported revenues of $26.26 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13%. EPS of $0.94 for the same period compares with $0.80 a year ago.",
			"Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.07 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.72%. The EPS surprise was +18.99%.",
			"Over the last four quarters, Bank of America surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.",
			"<b>Valuation</b>",
			"Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.",
			"Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.",
			"The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.",
			"Bank of America is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.",
			"<b>Bottom Line</b>",
			"The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Bank of America. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.",

			"OMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholders on Saturday overwhelmingly rejected six proposals for environmental, social and governance changes at Warren Buffett's conglomerate, all of which the billionaire investor and his board opposed.",
			"By margins of at least 3-to-1, shareholders voted against three proposals that Berkshire disclose more about its climate-related risks or greenhouse gas emissions and efforts to address them, and its efforts to promote diversity.",
			"They also voted down by a nearly 10-to-1 margin a renewed call for an independent director to replace Buffett as chairman.",
			"And a proposal that Berkshire and its operating units take no positions on controversial social and political issues unless it was necessary for business got less than 1% support.",
			"The proponent of the independent chair proposal said it would leave Berkshire \"less identified\" with Buffett's \"political activities.\"",
			"He also prompted audience boos by discussing Bill Gates, whose foundation is a big recipient of Buffett's wealth, and his onetime alleged relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and sex offender.",
			"Buffett said Berkshire's dozens of operating businesses recognize they do not have \"a piggy bank to promote their own views on politics,\" though political contributions at the corporate level \"unfortunately are in a few industries part of the way the world works.\"",
			"\"Generally speaking,\" he added, \"we've had quite a satisfactory experience\" at Berkshire.",
			"The votes were not surprising because Buffett owns special shares that give him a nearly 32% voting stake in Berkshire, making it difficult to adopt proposals he opposes.",
			"One of the climate disclosure proposals was co-sponsored by the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS), the largest U.S. public pension fund, and was rejected for a third straight year.",
			"CalPERS also withheld votes to reelect the three directors on Berkshire's audit committee for allowing inadequate disclosures of environmental risks.",
			"Berkshire shareholders also reelected the company's 15-person board.",

			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Welcome to Yahoo Finance's special coverage of the 2023 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting, known as the Woodstock of capitalism. And it's among the biggest events of the year for investors. We'll hear from legendary investor and Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett, along with his Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, as they give us their unique take on what's been a complicated year for the markets.",
			"A banking crisis, a slowing economy, geopolitical tensions, accelerated digital transformation with AI and a lot more, it's all on the agenda today. We're breaking down the big news from today's meeting and what's happening to the markets and your money.",
			"Brian Sozzi of Yahoo Finance here with Yahoo Finance's head of news, Myles Udland. And Myles and I, along with all of these people, are streaming out of the CHI Health Center in Omaha, Nebraska, have been ingesting hours and hours of Warren Buffett's insights into the economy and stocks alongside his right-hand man, Vice Chair Charlie Munger. And of course, we have a lot of takeaways.",
			"But let's start with three from this really celebration of capitalism, as those Berkshire shareholders love to call it. First off, the big banks, everybody in this room was waiting, Myles, to hear from Buffett on his views on the banks. Of course, First Republic now owned by JP Morgan, Buffett really not disappointing. Out of all the bank stocks that he talked about and the sector itself, he said he liked Bank of America, which he owns 13% of.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, well, so he came through his prepared remarks, which he said will be brief. They ran about 18 minutes, which I guess for Buffett--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> That's brief.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> --counts as brief. And we kind of got right into it with the regional banks. And really the question was, what would have happened had the deposits of Silicon Valley Bank not been insured, and ultimately Buffett going with what I think most people would have expected him to say, where he said it would have been catastrophic.",
			"And I think, you know, Sozzi, it brings me back to that weekend where the bank is seized by regulators Friday morning. And everyone's thinking what's going to happen over the weekend. Ultimately FDIC comes out. They say we're going to backstop these.",
			"And throughout the proceedings there were a couple of questions in this direction. And I think Buffett's takeaway is that effectively all deposits in the US are now backstopped.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> That's good.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Whether they say that or not.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> That's good. And that, of course, as well, Myles, as well, but come Monday morning's open for the market--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> I didn't get the sense that Buffett signaled to the world, go out and buy bank stocks. He sounded like many other people are, yeah, they might do this. They might do that. But I didn't hear that same tone compared to what I heard from Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, a couple of days at Milken, where she said things are stable. I just didn't get that vibe.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, I mean, we'll get to it in a little bit with his comments on Bank of America in more detail. But he did say that if you are an investor in banks right now or a prospective investor, I think he said, if you're a bank shareholder to use his phrase exactly, kind of hard to know what you buy, or what you're owning I guess in that situation. And a lot of it for him has to go with what are deposits.",
			"And he mentioned how sticky are deposits now, because did the whole wind-up. You don't have to stand in line to take him out of a bank. You can just go on your phone and pull your money. Obviously a dynamic that we saw with the Fed's report and the FDIC's report a couple of weeks ago is what happened at Silicon Valley Bank.",
			"What has been happening in the sector is people are wondering who is next. But really I think from Buffett's view, there's just a perception right now that you do not know for sure for sure what the business of a bank exactly looks like.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> And, you know, you mentioned Bank of America, Myles, and you're a student of Warren Buffett and this meeting, been coming to it for many years. I can't say I'm surprised that he called out Bank of America. Of course he owns 13% of it. But under CEO Brian Moynihan, they aren't necessarily out there taking these crazy risks that a lot of these other regional banks are. So a different company, but again, Buffett, being Buffett, suggesting that Bank of America is doing something right in this climate.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, and ultimately I think his takeaway was, well, I bought the thing back in 2011. He puts a bunch of capital in it. And I guess I'm going to see that through 12 years later.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Yep, absolutely. All right, well, outside the bank, of course, another takeaway we have is AI. So everybody was focused on what Buffett and Munger had to say on banks, but also artificial intelligence. And again, I'm going back. I'm thinking through the stock action on Monday. I just don't think these AI stocks, which have been really hot, come out blasting off of what Warren Buffett said out of the gate here.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> I mean sure, if you're trying to play the AI stocks--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> I'm trying to, I'm trying.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Based on what Warren Buffett is going to do, I mean, I don't really know if I can help you with that. But I think that the AI interaction there, and that was, I think, question two, three, four. It was right up there on the proceedings. It really got us our first great Mungerism of the day, when you're talking about what's the power of AI, this, that, and the other. And of course Charlie hits us with, well, I think old fashioned intelligence works just fine. We don't need the artificial stuff.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> There's nothing wrong with that.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> The good old fashioned intelligence is just fine in his view.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> But it is interesting that they view AI, they first went to BYD robots. Of course BYD is that electric car company. That's their first interpretation of what AI is, not Microsoft.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Buffett and that Bill Gates relationship, not what they're doing, robots making cars.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> And I think that the reason that people come to this event, and the reason that Warren and Charlie have an audience, is because they are representative in a lot of ways of the median investor's view on this. And sure, you talked a lot of people who get really excited about language learning models and all these kinds of AGI, right? It's not just AI. It's artificial general intelligence.",
			"And they're just like, I mean, we have robots, you know. Robots are fine. And also in this section, too, I think it's the first time of many times where we got to what if he references to nuclear weapons.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Yes.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> And the technology--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Which he always does, which he does in the past.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Is a regular feature of these. But I think that the risk of-- like the nuclear risk to Buffett is sort of the go to zero risk. And obviously in the '60s, very formative time in his career, and it's something that he brings up quite a bit.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> So bottom line with that takeaway, folks, is if you were looking for Warren Buffett to pitch shares of C3AI, not going to happen. Next take away, of course, value investing. That's why a lot of people that I've talked to at this event, that's why they come here, to get a sense of what Warren Buffett sees in terms of value. And it was interesting what he said on value investing, Myles.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, and, you know, I think this is where we saw the biggest distance between Warren and Charlie. Charlie Munger, very pessimistic on it, he said, I just think it's going to be worse in the future. And Buffett coming back and saying, well, you know, Charlie, you always say that.",
			"And I think that to use Munger's exact quote, my advice to value investors is get used to making less money. And you see the folks kind of behind us here certainly this morning teeming into the building, you know, people in sport coats and khakis, value types. I overheard quite a few conversations on my way in to that effect.",
			"And they weren't just trying to give some encouragement to the crowd. And this is where we kind of got to a Warren zinger, perhaps, where your biggest opportunity as an investor, value or otherwise, is other people doing dumb things.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Yeah, a lot of folks mistaking me for a hedge fund manager at this event. I also point out--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Well, you're dressed like one.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> I know.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> I'm dressed like a normal person. You're dressed like a hedge fund manager.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> I know. Well, I also, on value investing, I caught up with Whitney Tilson, longtime Buffett follower and friend of our shows. He said based on his models, he said this after the event, he calculates that Berkshire is trading at a 13% discount to intrinsic value. So if value investing is really dead, what do you do with Berkshire stock if it is that undervalued?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, well, what did Warren say? $504 billion on a GAAP basis is what the stock is worth? And you kind of, or I think it's $504,000 per share. You do the quick and dirty math on that, divided by the 1,500, you get 333 for B shares, and I think they closed around 320 on Friday.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> All right.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> So, I mean, Whitney always-- I've been in many presentations at this event with Whitney telling me that I should be buying Berkshire Hathaway. So I don't think you're going to get a different answer from him at other points in time.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Fair enough. All right, of course, we have a rapid-fire section for you as well, hitting a lot of these favorite Yahoo Finance tickers. First off Apple, of course, Apple is a key holder, a key holding inside of Berkshire Hathaway. And Myles, naturally, it took a little while to get that Apple question. But it was interesting how it was posed to him.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> It did, and we kind of got to it in two ways. I think what'll draw the headlines is Buffett saying, you know, I don't understand the product at all, or I don't understand the phone. But I understand the business. He understands the business of selling phones, not necessarily how one makes a phone.",
			"But that also got into really what I think Apple has become the most instructive holding within Berkshire's portfolio. They pay a huge dividend. So every quarter, they're getting hundreds of millions-- they're getting $100 million check, or it's not, it's much larger than that. But nine figure check coming to Berkshire Hathaway.",
			"Second thing, they buy back a lot of stock. So Berkshire's holdings in Apple, its percentage of the company that it owns, has gone up organically over time. We saw the announcement on Thursday night from Apple increasing the size of that buyback authorization.",
			"So it's going to continue to go up. And it led to this discussion of how much Apple do you really own. And you look at the equity portfolio, it's out 40%. And Buffett was like, it's not 40%. We own a bunch of other stuff, See's Candies, Garanimals, got tons of runs in a kid's clothing brand. Tons of run today. But basically being like we're not 35% Apple, because our equity holdings are only a small chunk of the whole Berkshire family.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> You look at Apple and you have to think, is this the new Coca-Cola for this generation in terms of an investment for Warren Buffett. Is this Warren Buffett connecting with that next generation of investors?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> I mean, I think, look, you can kind of say, and Buffett would probably say this, doesn't really matter what the product is. They have a dominant position in the market. They make a ton of money. They return a bunch of that money to shareholders.",
			"So whether you're selling Coca-Cola or you're selling iPhones, it hits all those criteria. And whatever generation you want to call any company, any company coming from, Buffett's going to like those characteristics.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Next up rapid-fire session here, Paramount. Of course, on Friday the stock got absolutely slaughtered, slashing its dividend, bad quarter, lots of losses. And one thing that stuck with me from that quarter from Paramount, Myles, when I talked to Amex's CEO, Stephen Squeri, that story is on our homepage now. He says do not surprise Warren Buffett.",
			"To me he sounded surprised this event. He did not come out and say, you know, Bob Bakish is a phenomenal manager. Of course that's the CEO of Paramount. He didn't do it. He didn't do it.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Well, we just talked about how Warren Buffett likes companies that return a lot of capital to shareholders. What did Paramount come out and do on Thursday? They cut their dividend. And Buffett says never good when a company announces a material cut to their dividend.",
			"You're trying to shore up your capital position. You can't give it back to your owners basically. So I'll be interested to see what happens with that position. It kind of is a small part of the Berkshire equity portfolio, kind of came up-- I won't say out of nowhere, he has a long history investing in the media business, but all of a sudden it's a bunch of Paramount. Now he owns 93 million shares of the company.",
			"And so we get into the conversation about the streaming wars. And I thought his comments on your eyeballs were quite hilarious.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Yeah, eyeballs matter, but in that--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> He goes everyone loves to use their eyes.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> No, yes, and that's key, he's clearly bullish eyes. But in that context, there's a lot of competition for our eyeballs, which is why I think that stake in Paramount disclosed in November last year raised a lot of eyebrows, because it wasn't really Warren Buffetty.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> I think everyone thinks the same thing, and, you know, look, the 13F will come out, I guess what, middle of next week, what they did or didn't do in the first quarter. So I think some questions there with that position.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> We're keeping it moving here, Taiwan Semiconductor, a position that Buffett took, what was it, late last year. And then he exited very quickly, not a very Warren Buffett type of move. But he did heap a lot of praise on that company.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, I mean, I'll kick this one right back to you, because you wrote up a quick story for us on this one. He heaped a lot of praise on it. And he kind of had a weird-- I don't know, I couldn't make sense of exactly what the point was on not wanting exposure to Taiwan, but saying US-China relations might be fine. Everyone has blame. I couldn't quite sort that one out.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Yeah, and if you're an Intel and you're a lot of these other chip-makers, to not hear Warren Buffett say you're doing cool stuff, not exactly a great thing. Lastly, Occidental Petroleum. Of course, a lot of investors, Warren Buffett built its position or his position in Occidental Petroleum under the potential, maybe goes out and just buys the darn company. But Warren said, eh-eh, unlikely to happen.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> He was very blunt. We are not going to make a play to take control of the company. They have approval to buy up to 50% of the outstanding shares. I think they own about 25% today. But, yeah, there was an analyst that talked to our RNS friend Josh Schafer last week who surmised maybe Vicki Hollub, CEO, would come in and run Berkshire Hathaway Energy when Greg Abel moves on. I mean, maybe that could happen.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Ooh, that's good.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, it was a good one in the story. But Buffett kind of squashing that today.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> And then final takeaways, Myles, to you. You first.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Really crowded, man, this place is crowded. This place yesterday, extremely stressful going in the Convention Hall.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> For me, two takeaways, one amazing to see Warren Buffett, 92 years old, Charlie Munger 99 years old, answering all these questions in top form. I'm just fascinated by the whole thing. And the next, last but not least, on Monday, the \"Morning Brief\" newsletter, please do check that out, subscribe, whatever. We're looking into the succession battle, or not battle, or succession plan here for Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway. Lots of interesting nuggets that our team pulled here from the event.",
			"But that's it for yours truly and Myles Udland. And we're going to get back and get some air conditioning. It's a little warm here in Omaha, Nebraska. We'll see you guys later."

			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Of course, we have a rapid-fire section for you as well, hitting a lot of these favorite Yahoo Finance tickers. First off, Apple, of course, Apple is a key holding inside of Berkshire Hathaway. And Myles, naturally, it took a little while to get that Apple question. But it was interesting how it was posed to them.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> It did. And we kind of got to it in two ways. I think what will draw the headlines is Buffett saying, I don't understand the product at all, or I don't understand the phone, but I understand the business. He understands the business of selling phones not necessarily how one makes a phone.",
			"But that also got into really what I think-- Apple has become the most instructive holding within Berkshire's portfolio. They pay a huge dividend. So every quarter, they're getting hundreds of-- they're getting $100 million check, or it's not-- it's much larger than that. But nine-figure check coming to Berkshire Hathaway.",
			"Second thing, they buy back a lot of stock. So Berkshire's holdings in Apple, its percentage of the company that it owns, has gone up organically over time. We saw the announcement on Thursday night from Apple increasing the size of that buyback authorization. So it's going to continue to go up.",
			"And it led to this discussion of how much Apple do you really own? And you look at the equity portfolio. It's about 40%. And Buffett was like, it's not 40%. We own a bunch of other stuff, See's Candies. Garanimals got tons of runs today, kids clothing brand, tons of run today.",
			"But basically being like we're not 35% Apple because our equity holdings are only a small chunk of the whole Berkshire family.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> You look at Apple. And you have to think, is this the new Coca-Cola for this generation in terms of an investment for Warren Buffett? Is this Warren Buffett connecting with that next generation of investors?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> I mean, I think look, you can kind of say-- and Buffett would probably say this. It doesn't really matter what the product is. They have a dominant position in the market. They make a ton of money. They return a bunch of that money to shareholders. So whether you're selling Coca-Cola or you're selling iPhones, it hits all those criteria.",
			"And whatever generation you want to call any company coming from, Buffett's going to like those characteristics.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Next up, rapid fire session here. Paramount, of course, on Friday, the stock got absolutely slaughtered, slashing its dividend, bad quarter, lots of losses. And one thing that stuck with me from that quarter from Paramount, Myles, when I talk to AmEx's CEO Steven Squeri-- that story is on our home page now. He says, do not surprise Warren Buffett.",
			"To me, he sounded surprised at this event. He did not come out and say, Bob Bakish is a phenomenal manager. Of course, that's the CEO of Paramount. He didn't do it. He didn't do it.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Well, we just talked about how Warren Buffett likes companies that return a lot of capital to shareholders. What did Paramount come out and do on Thursday? They cut their dividend. And Buffett says, never good when a company announces a material cut to their dividend. You're trying to shore up your capital position when you can't give it back to your owners basically.",
			"So I'll be interested to see what happens with that position. It kind of-- it's a small part of the Berkshire equity portfolio. It kind of came up-- I don't want to say out of nowhere. He has a long history of investing in the media business. But all of a sudden, it's like, oh, Buffett owns a bunch of Paramount. Now he owns 93 million shares of the company.",
			"And so we get into the conversation about the streaming wars. And I thought his comments on your eyeballs were quite hilarious.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Yeah, eyeballs matter. But in that--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> He goes, everyone loves to use their eyes.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> No, yes. It's key. He's clearly bullish eyes. But in that context, there's a lot of competition for our eyeballs, which is why I think that stake in Paramount, disclosed in November last year, raised a lot of eyebrows because it wasn't really Warren Buffetty.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> I think everyone thinks the same thing. And look, the 13-F will come out, I guess, what, middle of next week, what they did or didn't do in the first quarter. So I think some questions there with that position.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> We're keeping moving here, Taiwan Semiconductor a position that Buffett took-- what was it, late last year? And then he exited it very quickly, not a very Warren Buffett type of move. But he did hear a lot of praise on that company.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, I mean, I'll kick this one right back to you because you wrote up a quick story for us on this one. He heaped a lot of praise on it. And he kind of had a-- I don't know. I couldn't make sense of exactly what the point was on not wanting exposure to Taiwan but saying US-China relations might be fine. Everyone has blame. I couldn't quite sort that one out.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Yeah. And if you're an Intel and you're a lot of these other chip-makers, to not hear Warren Buffett say you're doing cool stuff, eh, not exactly a great thing.",
			"Lastly, Occidental Petroleum, of course, a lot of investors have been watching Warren Buffett build its position or his position in Occidental Petroleum under the potential, maybe he goes out and just buys the darn company. But Warren said, eh, eh, eh, unlikely to happen.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> He came-- he was very blunt. We were not going to make a play to take control of the company. They have approval to buy up to 50% of the outstanding shares. I think they own about 25% today. But yeah, there was an analyst that talked to our Ines Ferre and Josh Shafer last week who surmised maybe Vicki Hollub, CEO, would come in and run Berkshire Hathaway Energy when Greg Abel moves on. I mean, maybe that could happen.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Ooh, that's good.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, it was a good one in the story. But Buffett kind of squashing that today.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> And then final takeaways. Myles, to you first.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Really crowded. Man, this place is crowded. Yesterday, extremely stressful going in the convention hall.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> For me, two takeaways. One, amazing to see Warren Buffett, 92 years old, Charlie Munger, 99 old, answering all these questions, in top form. I'm just fascinated by the whole thing. And the next, last but not least, on Monday, \"the Morning Brief\" newsletter, please do check that out, subscribe, whatever. We're looking into the succession battle-- not battle, succession plan here for Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway, lots of interesting little nuggets that our team pulled here from the event.",
			"But that's it for yours truly and Myles Udland. We're going to get back and get some air conditioning. It's a little warm here in Omaha, Nebraska. We'll see you guys later."

			"(Bloomberg) -- Warren Buffett faced question after question about one thing in particular at Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s annual meeting on Saturday: His successor.",
			"Buffett named Greg Abel as heir apparent in 2021, and the vice chair for non-insurance operations has had a more pronounced presence ever since. On Saturday, Buffett reaffirmed he was “100% comfortable” with the decision and even indicated a largely business-as-usual transition, for whenever that could be.",
			"“Greg understands capital allocation as well as I do. That’s lucky for us,” Buffett said at the meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. “He will make those decisions, I think, very much in the same framework as I would make them. We have laid out that framework now for 30 years.”",
			"Abel, 60, who joined Buffett and his long-term business partner Charlie Munger on stage for the morning, has built Berkshire’s energy business into one of the largest in the US. Buffett recently joked that Abel does “all the work.” Here are the other main take aways from the meeting that drew Buffett disciples in their thousands.",
			"Occidental Control",
			"One analyst called it the biggest announcement of the day: Berkshire won’t make an offer for full control of Occidental Petroleum Corp., the energy firm it has spent months boosting its wagers on.",
			"The comment by Buffett likely helped temper speculation that Berkshire is seeking to own Occidental after winning approval from US regulators last year to acquire as much as 50% of the firm. Buffett didn’t rule out buying more stock of the Houston-based firm, adding it may — or may not — seek further purchases.",
			"Banking Turmoil",
			"Buffett and Munger were so sure they’d be questions about the recent banking turmoil that they jokily brought placards bearing the accounting classifications spotlighted during the upheaval. One was labeled “available for sale,” while the other read “held to maturity.”",
			"Striking a more serious note, Buffett faulted the executives in charge of the failed banks, arguing they should be held accountable for mistakes that were hiding in “plain sight.” He also called out “messed up” incentives in banking regulation, as well as poor messaging by regulators, politicians and the press to the American public about the upheaval.",
			"Buffett pointed to First Republic Bank, the beleaguered lender which JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. just rescued. First Republic’s filings showed the lender was offering jumbo, non-government-backed mortgages at fixed rates that were interest-only for 10 years in some cases — which Buffett called “a crazy proposition.”",
			"“It was doing it in plain sight and the world ignored it ‘til it blew up,” Buffett said.",
			"The turmoil began with the liquidation of a small crypto-friendly lender in early March before it spread to engulf three other regional banks, including Silicon Valley Bank. Buffett said it would have been catastrophic for the US if the government hadn’t moved to guarantee all of SVB’s deposits, the vast majority of which weren’t covered by the $250,000 Federal Insurance Deposit Corp. cap.",
			"Debt Ceiling",
			"As lawmakers race to resolve a standoff around the US debt ceiling, Buffett said he couldn’t see how Washington would allow the US to default on its debt, an outcome that would tip the financial system into turmoil.",
			"Investors and politicians are zeroing in on whether or not the US government can avoid crashing into its statutory debt ceiling and a potentially catastrophic technical default that could follow.",
			"Despite the impasse, Buffett reiterated his belief in America as an “incredible society” with “everything going for us.” Given the choice, he would still want to be born in the US, he said.",
			"Earnings Decline",
			"The firm posted an almost 13% gain in operating earnings to $8.07 billion for the first quarter, powered by its insurance underwriting businesses including auto-insurer Geico, which swung to profitability following six quarters of losses.",
			"But the results came with a gloomier forecast: that earnings at the majority of Berkshire’s sprawling collection of businesses would decline this year as “incredible period” for the economy draws to an end amid inflation and rising rates.",
			"Still, Buffett said he expects earnings at its insurance underwriting operations — which are less correlated to business activity — to improve this year. Geico posted $703 million in profit as higher average premiums and lower advertising spending contributed to the gain even as claim frequencies fell, Berkshire said.",
			"Geopolitics, Taiwan",
			"In the fourth quarter, Buffett slashed his holding of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. just months after disclosing a major stake in a quick reversal that spooked investors. Buffett said Saturday the company was one of the best managed and most important in the world, but that he didn’t like the location — a reference to Taiwan amid rising tensions between the island and China.",
			"Buffett and Munger emphasized the need for smooth relations between the US and China and urged increased trade. While the two will be competitive, they will always need to judge “how far you can push the other guy without them reacting wrong,” Buffett said.",

			"Until recently, Berkshire also owned $10 billion of Occidental preferred stock with an 8% dividend, which helped fund the Anadarko purchase, plus warrants to buy another $5 billion of common shares at $59.62 each.",
			"Berkshire said on Saturday that Occidental redeemed about $474 million of the preferred stock at a premium, which it had a right to do, reducing dividend payouts.",
			"Last August, Berkshire won U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission permission to buy up to 50% of Occidental's common stock.",
			"It needed the authorization because it would have had exceeded the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's 25% ownership limit had it exercised the warrants.",
			"Buffett, 92, has longed for another large acquisition for his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate, whose dozens of businesses include Geico car insurance and the BNSF railroad.",
			"Berkshire had a 22.6% stake in BNSF before paying $26.5 billion for the remainder in 2010.",

			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> All right. Joining me now is See's Candies CEO Pat Egan. Pat, good to see you--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">PAT EGAN:</span> Good to see you.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> --on the floor of the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting. How do you spend your time at an event like this?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">PAT EGAN:</span> Well, for me it's kind of old-home week. I've had the fortune of being part of the Berkshire Hathaway family for-- I don't know, 15, 16 years or so and enjoy seeing some old friends. But for us here, it's about bringing the joy. It's about selling this wonderful product. And yesterday was a crazy day. We sold a lot of great chocolate and peanut brittle.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Isn't there a-- isn't there a CEO dinner here that you go to? What is that like?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">PAT EGAN:</span> Well, there are a few-- there are a few dinners, different gatherings. And I happened to go to one last night that was just really inspiring and a lot of fun. And I got to hear Charlie share some great wisdom, as he always does, and see some old friends, as well.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Interesting. It was-- I think I talked to Amex CEO, Stephen Squeri-- of course, a Berkshire-owned company.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">PAT EGAN:</span> Yes.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> And he's like, it was intimidating the first time I met Warren Buffett. Do you still feel that some way?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">PAT EGAN:</span> I mean, always. He's such a towering-- I mean, there's nobody like him. There's nobody like him. There's nobody like Charlie. There's nobody like Greg. There's nobody like Ajit. It's just, being in the presence of that much quality and wisdom is-- isn't-- I mean, it's a little intimidating. It always is.",
			"But they definitely put you at ease. And it's not about their ego always. It's just their accomplishments. And being a part of that-- it's pretty amazing.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> So tell us about the business of See's Candies. How many stores do you have open? And how's the business doing?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">PAT EGAN:</span> Business is doing great. We have a little over 250 year-round shops. We do holiday gift centers, about 130 or so of those. They're all doing great. Our business is up. Our traffic is up. Obviously, coming on the other side of the pandemic, that's very welcome.",
			"And our e-commerce business has really blown up in the last two years. We hit a peak in 2020. And we've maintained it. We haven't dropped off, which is a testament to our marketing team. So our e-commerce business has basically doubled in the last three years.",
			"And then we're growing international locations, small regional high-end grocers, and we're just adding more and more. It's this team. Our team is fantastic.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> How do you explain the boom we've seen in snacking? And it started during the pandemic, but it has continued. More people are snacking more.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">PAT EGAN:</span> Yeah. Yeah they are. Well-- so I mentioned earlier, I'm on the board of the National Confectioners Association. So I've learned a lot from my friends and colleagues. I look at it as, we all need that special treat. The last few years have been very hard. And it's kind of a respite. It's a way for people to relax and get to gatherings.",
			"And for us particularly, we're a part of a lot of family gatherings, a lot of get-togethers. And there's a lot more of that that's happening in the last couple of years.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> At this event, what are your top sellers? Of course I see the boxes with Warren Buffett all over them. I mean-- do those move? How do those move?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">PAT EGAN:</span> That one's a lot of fun. If you can see this, so this is-- the theme this year is the '70s. And we went right to \"Saturday Night Fever.\" So those are flying off the shelves. Peanut brittle is always popular because that's Charlie and Warren's major treat.",
			"And then this year, we've actually added a couple of new things that are bringing people in. Like I said, the box. We have these Berkshire coins that are always big sellers, because they've got the image of Mary See, Warren, and Charlie. And then just our regular pack. People have their favorites. They come in and they bring them on home.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> The prices seem attainable to me. And I don't know what they were last year. But have you raised prices because of inflation?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">PAT EGAN:</span> Sure.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> And what does that inflationary outlook look like?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">PAT EGAN:</span> Well, certainly we've raised prices. Every business has to. We have to cover our costs. And our ingredients cost, as an example, have gone up 30% year over year. So we have to make sure that we're covering that and labor costs.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> And that's just sugar, milk--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">PAT EGAN:</span> Yeah. Well, sugar has more than doubled. Sugar is more expensive in the United States of America than any other place on the planet. It's a price-controlled kind of a scheme. And in our view, that's doubled just in the last six months. Butter is up over 100% in the last year. So yes, we have to cover all of that.",
			"I believe that we're actually, I hope, at the peak of that. I do see stock starting to build a little bit more. So we have a better buying opportunity for a lot of our wonderful ingredients. But yeah. No, we definitely have seen that hit us.",
			"But we definitely-- our price point is better than anybody else. We look at any competitor and I kind of challenge anybody to find a $30 box of wonderful chocolate and even approach our quality.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Chatter is you're dabbling in the coffee business now a little bit. What is that all about?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">PAT EGAN:</span> Well, so See's has always had a wonderful coffee line. We have a couple of pieces. Our Kona mocha piece, for example. We have real coffee. So anybody who has any of our coffee flavored, it's not coffee flavor. It's actual coffee that we select and put in.",
			"And about three years ago we actually reached out to Peet's Coffee and said, we want to make a chocolate covered coffee bean with our chocolate and your signature beans. So we have a Brazilian arabica medium roast that is just the perfect blend with our dark chocolate. And they fly off the shelves. We actually sold out of those yesterday here.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Wow. That is-- wow. That is pretty impressive. I've talked to a lot of the leaders here. So I've talked to Dairy Queen CEO Troy Bader, Brooks Running CEO Jim Weber, now you. And I've asked them all, when this is not here and when Warren's not running the company--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">PAT EGAN:</span> Yeah.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> What does that look like? And do you report to Greg Abel?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">PAT EGAN:</span> Sure. Yes. I report to Greg and to Warren together. And what I like to say about that is, when Mr Buffett says, \"I hire good managers, and I expect them to manage,\" that's what he means. Which means it's on us. We run this business. We take care of the risk. We're the chief risk officers. And it's up to us.",
			"And so I get the pleasure-- I've only been here for 4 and 1/2 years-- of running a candy company that was vastly successful before I ever got here. And I just got to not screw that up.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Is it fair to say that Greg is a true disciple of Warren Buffett? Do you see similarities?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">PAT EGAN:</span> Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, that level of intellect and the sincerity-- that level of just being a genuine person and being a decent person, which is actually, at this level of business, a little bit unique. And so that's part of what I love about it is just being able to say, we just operate to the right principles-- integrity, respect, making sure you take care of your customers and your employees-- and the results follow.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> I have to tell you-- I told Dairy Queen this-- I've never had Dairy Queen, never had See's before.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">PAT EGAN:</span> You're going to grow as an individual, Brian. We're going to get you-- we're going to get you some of the best chocolate you can find any place.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> I need to grow. My mom has been telling me that for the past decade. We'll leave it there. Pat Egan, enjoy the rest of this conference. It's good to see you.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">PAT EGAN:</span> Listen to your mom. Listen to your mom.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> That's true Thank you so much. I appreciate it.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">PAT EGAN:</span> Thank you, Brian."

			"\"Apple is not 35% of a Berkshire portfolio,\" Buffett said. \"Berkshire’s portfolio includes the railroad and the energy business Garanimals, you name it, See's Candies — they're all businesses.\"",
			"Berkshire listed $997 billion in assets at the end of the first quarter, and only $328.16 billion of those were investments in equity securities.

			"That has spawned from additional buying by Berkshire but also from growth in Apple’s services business and Apple’s commitment to stock buybacks. Apple stock has risen more than 500% since Berkshire first purchased it while buybacks have increased Berkshire’s stake in Apple. Today, Berkshire owns about 5.8% of the company.",
			"\"It just happens to be a better business than any we own,\" Buffet said. \"And we put a fair amount of money in it, but we haven't got more money in it than we've got in the railroad...our railroad is [a] very good business, [but] was not remotely as good as Apple's business.\"",
			"Buffett has long been a supporter of Apple CEO Tim Cook and the stickiness of the company’s products, including the iPhone. On Saturday, Buffett quipped: \"I don't understand the [iPhone] at all, but I do understand consumer behavior.\"",

			"\"Apple is in a position with consumers, where they're paying maybe $1,500 bucks, or whatever it may be, for a phone,\" Buffett said. \"And the same people pay $35,000 for having a second car, and [when] they have to give up a second car or give up their iPhone, they'd give up their second car. I mean, it's an extraordinary product. We don't have anything like that that we own 100% of, but we're very, very, very happy to have 5.6%, or whatever it may be, and we're delighted every 10th of a percent that goes up.\"",
			"The discussion around Berkshire’s ownership of Apple stemmed from an investor question about portfolio diversification. And while Berkshire owns a plethora of stocks, its top holdings have quickly become the company’s largest. Five companies <a class=\"link\" data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" data-ylk=\"slk:comprise;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXoZ28KAxB8\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">comprise</a> about 75% of Berkshire's stock holdings.",
			"Buffett’s right-hand man Charlie Munger doesn't think the lack of diversification is a problem.",
			"\"One of the inane things [that gets] taught in modern university education is that a vast diversification is absolutely mandatory in investing in common stocks,\" Munger said. \"That is an insane idea. It's not that easy to have a vast plethora of good opportunities that are easily identified. And if you've only got three, I'd rather it be my best ideas instead of my worst. And now, some people can't tell their best ideas from their worst, and in the act of deciding an investment already is good, they get to think it's better than it is. I think we make fewer mistakes like that than other people. And that is a blessing to us.\"",

			"Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) is hosting its much-anticipated annual meeting this weekend, and as usual, this coincides with the company's first-quarter earnings release. As Warren Buffett has pointed out many times, Berkshire's bottom-line earnings aren't a great indicator of how well the business is performing. Because so much of Berkshire's assets is invested in publicly traded stocks, and accounting rules require unrealized gains and losses to be included in earnings, the bottom-line earnings per share (EPS) number doesn't accurately convey how much money the company truly earned."

			"(Bloomberg) -- Warren Buffett, whose economic insights are craved for Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s deep ties to the American economy, had a gloomy prediction for his own businesses: the good times may be over.",
			"The billionaire investor expects earnings at the majority of Berkshire’s operations to fall this year as a long-predicted downturn slows economic activity. He made his comments at the conglomerate’s annual general meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, after Berkshire posted an almost 13% gain in operating earnings to $8.07 billion for the first quarter.",
			"“The majority of our businesses will report lower earnings this year than last year,” Buffett, 92, said, before crowds of thousands at the event on Saturday. During the last six months or so, the “incredible period” for the US economy has been coming to an end, he said.",
			"Berkshire is often seen as a proxy for economic health owing to the expansive nature of its businesses ranging from railroad to electric utilities and retail. Buffett himself has said Berkshire owes its success to the incredible growth of the US economy over the decades, but his prediction for a slowdown at his firms comes as upheaval at regional banks threatens to curtail lending as inflation and higher rates continue to bite.",
			"Buffett’s long-time business partner Charlie Munger, 99, who joined him on stage, said the more-difficult economic environment will also make it harder for value investors, who typically buy stocks that look cheap compared to the intrinsic value of the businesses.",
			"“Get used to making less,” Munger said.",
			"Geico Revived",
			"Still, Buffett said he expects earnings at its insurance underwriting operations — which are less correlated to business activity — to improve this year. Berkshire already reported higher earnings at those businesses including auto-insurer Geico, which swung to profitability following six quarters of losses.",
			"Geico posted $703 million in earnings as higher average premiums and lower advertising spending contributed to the gain even as claim frequencies fell, Berkshire said in a statement reporting its earnings Saturday. That revival follows a difficult period for the underwriting business as inflation took its toll on the cost of materials and labor.",
			"Geico has been facing particular pressure from rivals including Progressive Corp., which Buffett has called “well-run,” and Allstate Corp. which had long used telematics programs to track drivers and encourage better behavior before Geico introduced the offering. Geico’s profit also helped Berkshire’s insurance underwriting businesses deliver $911 million in profit compared with $167 million a year earlier.",
			"Berkshire has previously said it expected Geico to return to operating profitability in 2023, after securing premium rate increases. Still, Geico remains an issue for Berkshire, with top line growth in the quarter of less than 1% that “significantly lags peers,” CFRA analyst Cathy Seifert said.",
			"“I suspect rate hikes being put through to offset claim cost inflation is being met with policy cancellations,” she said. “While the loss of unprofitable policies is not always a bad thing- that’s not usually the policies — and policyholders — that leave.”",
			"Railroads, Running",
			"Other parts of the conglomerate took a hit, with after-tax earnings from Berkshire Hathaway Energy falling 46.3% from the same time last year amid “lower earnings from the US regulated utilities, other energy businesses and real estate brokerage businesses.” Railroad results were also weaker than expected due to a fall in freight volumes and higher operating expenses, according to Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan.",
			"But at one of Berkshire’s best known businesses, Brooks Running Co., Chief Executive Officer Jim Weber was skeptical of a steep consumer downturn.",
			"“With unemployment being so low, it’s hard to be believing we’re going to fall off a cliff into a recession at the consumer level,” Weber said in an interview on Friday ahead of the meeting. “I wonder if this is going to be an asset-value recession.”",
			"Berkshire bought back $4.4 billion of stock, an increase from the same period last year, as the investor’s sprawling firm confronted turbulent markets that offered fewer of the blockbuster deals he’s renowned for. Berkshire has turned toward buybacks more often as valuations in public markets had made it more challenging for Buffett to identify promising acquisitions.",
			"Cash Hoard",
			"Berkshire also topped up its cash pile, ending the quarter with roughly $130.6 billion, after finishing last year with $128.6 billion of cash on hand. The company was a net seller of equities in the quarter, pocketing $10.4 billion from stock sales after deducting purchases.",
			"As the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to combat inflation, Berkshire’s investment earnings rose, helping overall profit increase to $35.5 billion in the quarter. Berkshire often recommends that investors look past investment gains, which are tied to accounting rules and can be misleading to investors.",
			"“Our investment income is going to be a lot larger this year than last year, and that’s built in,” Buffett said at the annual meeting.",

			"OMAHA, Nebraska, May 6 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc posted a $35.5 billion first-quarter profit on Saturday, reflecting gains from stocks such as Apple Inc, while higher investment income and a rebound at car insurer Geico bolstered operating results.",
			"Berkshire also sped up repurchases of its own stock, buying back $4.4 billion, while paring its investments in other stocks such as Chevron Corp, which is still a major holding.",
			"Results were released ahead of Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, part of a weekend that draws tens of thousands of people to the city.",
			"Buffett, 92, has run Berkshire since 1965, transforming it from a struggling textile company into a conglomerate with dozens of businesses including Geico, the BNSF railroad, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and manufacturing and retail units including See's Candies and Dairy Queen ice cream.",
			"The diversification has led many investors, not just Buffett fans, to view Berkshire as a stable long-term investment even amid recession fears and concerns about the banking industry.",
			"Net income equaled $24,377 per Class A share and rose from $5.58 billion, or $3,784 per share, a year earlier.",
			"That in part reflected a 27% jump in Apple's stock price, leaving Berkshire with a $151 billion stake in the iPhone maker.",
			"An accounting rule requires Berkshire to report unrealized gains and losses with net results, and Buffett urges investors to ignore the resulting volatility.",
			"Quarterly operating profit increased 13% to $8.07 billion, or about $5,561 per Class A share, from $7.16 billion.",
			"Those results benefited from Geico snapping a six-quarter string of underwriting losses, and a 68% increase in how much Berkshire's insurance units generate from investments.",
			"Geico's pretax underwriting gain was $703 million, benefiting from higher premiums, fewer crashes and a significant drop in ad spending, which may have led to fewer high-risk drivers seeking coverage.",
			"Berkshire's cash hoard grew $2 billion in the quarter to $130.6 billion, as the company sold $13.3 billion of stocks and bought just $2.9 billion.",
			"Chevron appears to have been among the sales, with Berkshire's stake falling 28% to $21.6 billion though the oil company's stock price dropped just 9%.",
			"Berkshire also owns a 23.6% stake in another oil company, Occidental Petroleum Corp.",
			"Its stock sales more than offset the $8.2 billion Berkshire spent to boost its stake in truck stop operator Pilot Travel Centers to 80% from 38.6%, leaving the founding Haslam family with 20%. The increase was expected.",
			"Profit at the BNSF railroad fell 9% to $1.25 billion, hurt by higher fuel costs and lower shipping volumes.",
			"Berkshire Hathaway Energy, normally a steady earnings generator, saw profit fall 46% as it set aside $359 million for legal and other costs from wildfires in Oregon and northern California, where it has multiple operations, in 2020.",
			"Operating results also reflected October's purchase of insurance holding company Alleghany Corp, while net results included a gain related to Pilot.",
			"Berkshire's Class A shares have risen 4.9% this year, trailing the Standard &amp; Poor's 500's 7.7% gain. The index lagged Berkshire by 23.4 percentage points in 2022, excluding dividends. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in Omaha, Nebraska; Editing by Alexander Smith and Diane Craft)"

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. This means that investors who purchase HSBC Holdings' shares on or after the 11th of May will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 23rd of June.",
			"The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.10 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$0.32 per share to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that HSBC Holdings has a trailing yield of 4.2% on the current share price of £5.998. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing.",

			"Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. For this reason, we're glad to see HSBC Holdings's earnings per share have risen 19% per annum over the last five years.",
			"Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. HSBC Holdings has seen its dividend decline 7.5% per annum on average over the past six years, which is not great to see. It's unusual to see earnings per share increasing at the same time as dividends per share have been in decline. We'd hope it's because the company is reinvesting heavily in its business, but it could also suggest business is lumpy.",
			"Is HSBC Holdings worth buying for its dividend? Companies like HSBC Holdings that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings, are usually reinvesting heavily in their business. This strategy can add significant value to shareholders over the long term - as long as it's done without issuing too many new shares. HSBC Holdings ticks a lot of boxes for us from a dividend perspective, and we think these characteristics should mark the company as deserving of further attention.",

			"<span class=\"speaker\">-</span> Well, Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting is almost here. The big meeting kicks off tomorrow, Saturday, in Omaha, Nebraska. Investors are eagerly awaiting to see what Warren Buffett has to say on the turmoil that has engulfed regional bank stocks. Let's bring in Nebraska Congressman Mike Flood, member of the House Financial Services Committee.",
			"He is already there on the ground. Congressman, this is kind of the Super Bowl for your home state. Every year you've got thousands of people going there to try and get a good just a piece of investing advice here from Warren Buffett. What are you looking to hear?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MIKE FLOOD:</span> Well, obviously, we celebrate and have celebrated the success of Warren Buffett and all of his investors for decades here in Nebraska. Nebraska is home to a lot of top 10 Fortune 500 companies. Today is a celebration of everything that Berkshire Hathaway has been able to do for investors. And what we look for from Warren Buffett is the stability and the common sense leadership that he provides in our markets.",
			"Every single year you take away a couple of real nuggets from Warren Buffett. And he's careful not to share them much along the way throughout the rest of the year. And so we're looking forward to that. And I know that not just Nebraskans but Americans and investors from across the world are converging on Omaha right now. And you're right, this is the financial services Super Bowl of America right now and I'm in the middle of it.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">-</span> Well, Congressman, I'm sure many investors are going to be eagerly awaiting for what Warren Buffett has to say about the recent instability and turmoil that we've seen play out within the regional banks. I'm curious to get your perspective on that turmoil and what you think that landscape looks like for regional banks here going forward.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MIKE FLOOD:</span> Well, one of the big strengths to the American financial system is that we have diversity in the types of financial institutions that we have. Obviously, we have thousands of community banks. We have that middle tier, which we're very worried about right now. And then we have the large banks like Bank of America, Wells Fargo. One of the things that we're working on in the Financial Services Committee is what do we need to do when it comes to FDIC insurance?",
			"What does the Congress need to do in terms of rules and policies to protect that middle tier, SVB, Signature, obviously First Republic, different situations in the last one. But at the end of the day, we need to protect that middle tier. It provides us the diversity in our financial markets that the European Union doesn't have. In the EU you just have the big banks, which allows policies like climate change to seep into the markets and to have a disproportionate effect.",
			"Here in the United States we're very focused and we're very focused under Patrick McHenry's leadership, protecting that middle tier and promoting diversity in our institutions.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">-</span> Investors still certainly trying to process the wild swings we saw in the regional bank stocks this week. There's some concern about short-sellers targeting these names. And potentially that was the reason behind the volatility that we saw. You're on the House Financial Services Committee.",
			"Would you support a temporary ban on short-selling? And do you think something like that is necessary to at least restore the confidence within the financial system?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MIKE FLOOD:</span> You know, I'm not ready to go there yet. I think that what we need to do is we need to recognize that investors, depositors need to have confidence in that middle tier. That was the issue that led us down the road with SVB and Signature Bank. We also recognize that we're in an environment now where the wrong tweet or digital information can cause a modern-day bank run.",
			"Do we need to take some steps? Yes. I'm not convinced exactly what those steps are. I'm still sifting through the Fed's report. And I know as a committee, we've been off this week and we're planning to meet next week and get more information and ultimately chart out a course that protects that middle tier of banks in the United States.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">-</span> Another thing that's keeping Congress, lawmakers very busy is the showdown over the debt ceiling. And I know President Biden planning to meet with congressional leaders, speaking with them next Tuesday. I'm curious just to get your perspective. It doesn't leave much time to get a deal done. Are there any signs that these talks are progressing at all?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MIKE FLOOD:</span> Well, if you would have told Americans 60 days ago that a majority of House Republicans could land on a debt ceiling plan, I think a lot of people would have been surprised. The fact that we got 217 votes to put everything together speaks about the unity we have in the House Conference right now.",
			"The ball is clearly in President Biden's court. It's clearly in the Senate's court. We need them to act in the best interest of our nation. And there's never been a debt ceiling conversation that hasn't included talks about spending cuts. We have to look at both the short-term and the long-term.",
			"And that's our message from the House Financial Services Committee. We're committed to a responsible raise of the debt ceiling. But we also have to look at how we are mortgaging our children's future. And we are looking for, as you know, $4 billion, or $4 trillion in cuts over the next 10 years. And that's exactly what we delivered to the Senate.",
			"And I know that President Biden got a real wake-up call when it happened. His spending has gotten us into this jam, and now he needs to figure out how we're going to lift this ceiling and work with the House Republicans to make it happen.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">-</span> Congressman, there are some reports out there that suggest there are a handful, a small handful, of some of your Republican colleagues that are potentially considering a debt limit increase by a procedure that would essentially bypass House leadership. Where do you stand in that debate? And would you ultimately support a temporary increase in the debt limit to allow for further negotiations?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MIKE FLOOD:</span> I think what America is missing right now is that the Republican conference is united behind Speaker Kevin McCarthy's leadership. When I voted for that debt ceiling deal in the House of Representatives, I essentially was voting to empower Speaker Kevin McCarthy to transact this deal on the House's behalf.",
			"And I think when you talk to our conference, you will find almost to a one, we are united in our belief that Kevin McCarthy is going to be the one at the negotiating table. Kevin McCarthy, our Speaker, is going to be the one that makes the decision. And this idea that we're somehow fractured is-- I don't know where that's coming from.",
			"It's probably a rumor the Democrats want to start. That's not what I see where we're in the room. And don't get me wrong. There's a lot of us like myself. We, I would say almost all of us, we see the value of, and we know the importance of a debt ceiling increase, when we're facing these problems. But we also know that it has to be paired with cuts.",
			"It has to be paired with slowing down our financial spending. And that's why when we talk about negotiating, Speaker Kevin McCarthy is our proxy. He's the one doing it and we're united behind him.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">-</span> Well, we will see whether your party and the other side of the aisle is able to reach an agreement here in a timely fashion. Congressman Mike Flood, thanks so much for your time. Have a great time at the conference."

			"<span class=\"speaker\">SEANA SMITH:</span> Let's get back to Brian Sozzi in Omaha with the CEO of Brooks Running. Hey, Soz.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> All right, thanks so much Seana. I'm here with Jim Weber. Jim, good to see you as always. You're a bit of a rock star here. Everybody is taking photos in front of you. The crowd is packed. Good to see you here.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JIM WEBER:</span> It's great to be in Omaha. This is such a unique event. We'll sell as many pairs of shoes here as we would at a great marathon expo. And it's because of Warren. We put Warren on the shoe, and everybody wants a pair.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> I got here-- I've been here maybe an hour and a half, two hours. And the lines at your booth are snaking around your booth. What do the sales look like?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JIM WEBER:</span> You know, we brought 6,000 pairs in. And this is the record. It's interesting, you know? Last year, people were coming back. We've never seen this much activity here. So it feels like there's a lot of people in Omaha. And they've got to lace up for our race. We got a 5K race Sunday morning too, so.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> That's great. Talk to us a bit about the state of your business. How was the first quarter? I think we saw a lot of retailers a little cautious.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JIM WEBER:</span> Yep.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Sales slowed down a little bit. What'd you see at Brooks?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JIM WEBER:</span> So far, here's what we're seeing. You know, we started to fulfill demand after the supply chain craziness. We were up over 40% in Q4. We're up 20% in Q1. So we're seeing great demand.",
			"As of last week, retail in the US is fantastic. We're still seeing across channels really good sell-through, at least in performance running. Europe, we're seeing a slowdown. The last two months, Europe has definitely slowed down. We think the economy and concerns are starting to take hold there. But US retail is quite good.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> So when you crunch the numbers in the US, do you see anything that would suggest a recession is on the horizon?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JIM WEBER:</span> Wow. You know, I think we're all cautious. I think we're all cautious. And there's anxiety. There's apprehension. But we've seen in the past that running often can kind of transcend a recession.",
			"So we're pretty confident, cautiously, that running is gonna be fine through this. But I don't think anyone knows. Retail is really hard to judge for fall. We think the consumers-- their employment's good. You know, households are still in good, healthy shape. So I'm optimistic. But hard to know.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Has inflation started to ease?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JIM WEBER:</span> Absolutely. We're seeing supply chain-- oil's now, I think, below $70 a share. So supply chain has normalized, both in terms of service levels and costs. And that's really big for us. And even materials inflation is so much driven by the petroleum market. So we're definitely seeing inflation settle down.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Explain to us the popularity for your shoe, because you have what, 23% market share?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JIM WEBER:</span> Yep, at measured retail in the United States.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> There's a lot of new competitors in your space.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JIM WEBER:</span> There is.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Why are you able to hold on to that market share?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JIM WEBER:</span> You know, we've been at this for 22 years, of focusing only on the runner and really trying to build the best gear from head to toe. And we think you have to earn it. For people that are really putting in mileage, 20 miles into the shoe, they know if they're ever gonna buy that shoe again.",
			"So we built a lot of trust, I think, with runners over time. And we feel like you got to earn them every time. We wake up every day, and we feel like we have to earn the runner's support for our gear. And so it's very competitive. They've never had more choices. But we're optimistic about our ability to service the runner.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> I went to your website. You're selling sneakers with nitrogen in them. Is that marketing? Is that going to make me run faster?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JIM WEBER:</span> I love engineering. I'm not an engineer, but I love it. We've been engineering materials specifically for running shoes for 20 years. This material is actually really special.",
			"Normally, when you're engineering material, you have to trade off lightweight, cushioning, resiliency properties, durability. We saw no trade-offs. This is better in every front. And it's the molecular level. It's a lighter molecule. But the cushioning and the durability is among the best we've ever seen.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> So what you're saying is--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JIM WEBER:</span> It's really good.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> --I'm going to run faster.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JIM WEBER:</span> And you're gonna enjoy it more. Yeah.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Where is Brooks on the sustainability push? I think we've seen brands like AirBirds come in here, try to pull chemicals out of their products. Is that something you're focused on?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JIM WEBER:</span> You know, we've set some goals over the next 15 years that we think the runner is going to expect us to really limit our impact on the planet because they run outdoors. So you know, our Ghost is our number one selling shoe. It's the number one selling running shoe in the United States. It's carbon neutral. And it's done in a combination of 60% recycled materials and carbon offsets.",
			"We got a long way to go, but we just think the runner's gonna expect it. So it's an engineering challenge. And then we're working on circularity too. And running shoes wear out, and bringing them back, and recycling the materials. We think it's table stakes. Over the next 15 years, we got to figure it out.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> As a company inside the portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway, run by Warren Buffett, what has that experience been like over the past decade?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JIM WEBER:</span> You know, I've learned a lot because we've always treated all of our owners as investors and really tried to steward this brand and business to build value. But I underestimated how much ownership can matter because they're long-term thinkers. And they know that the brand is in the mind of the customer. And that's where all of our revenue growth, all of our margin, all of our profitability comes from.",
			"So they're totally supportive of us building the brand in the minds of our customers. And everybody can say that, but they're really committed to it. So we couldn't be happier. They're supporting us to invest against the growth of this brand, and it's really fun.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> The other side of this is, no one lives forever. And no one can be CEO forever. When Warren is not here, what happens?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JIM WEBER:</span> Yep. Well, I think the board has made it pretty clear. Greg Abel's going to be the guy. I report to Greg now. And Warren sees everything we do, of course. And we still connect.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Is that report-- is it different dealing with Greg than Warren?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JIM WEBER:</span> Well, actually not. The philosophy's the same. The culture's the same. The focus on cash flow and returns is the same, understanding a brand. The difference is Greg's a faster runner than Warren.",
			"We had Greg out for a strategy review. He sample sized. He tried on all of our prototypes in our development timetable for the next three years. It's really powerful because he's a runner. So that's a big difference. He's faster.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> From the outsider looking in, and lastly, is it fair to say that Greg is a true disciple of Warren? Can you see the similarities between the two?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JIM WEBER:</span> Oh, my. I think the business savvy and the business mindset? Absolutely. Absolutely. We have great conversations. And he likes Brooks for the same reasons that Warren liked Brooks. And that's important to us, right? We have to earn their trust and support. That's my primary job. And we work hard to do that. And I think we've got it.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> And we'll let you get back to working the floor. You're a very popular and in-demand guy here. Brooks Running CEO Jim Weber, good to see you. Appreciate it.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JIM WEBER:</span> Thanks, Brian. Thanks for having me.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Guys, back to you.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">-</span> Brian, I have to say, I'm feeling a little guilty listening to Jim. I can't remember the last time I went for a run. But I'm gonna definitely try on those shoes and maybe--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> You can do it today. It's OK.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">-</span> --take it for a run.",

The lines were really robust. A lot of people in here just doing some shopping like me. I picked up this stuff Geico doll. I saw our head of news and resident Buffett historian Myles Udland walking the floor too as well, taking it all in. Lots of See's Candies being sold as well.",

			"They are curious if he gives any indication when Greg Abel might take over. Now, there were some comments, I believe it was from Reuters reporting today, from director Ron Wall that Buffett has no intention of stepping down as CEO any time soon. So that was an interesting tidbit ahead of the meeting.",
			"But by and large, lots of crowds here, lots of people buying stuff. At least from inside the CHI Health Center, guys. There is no indication of a recession. People are buying $150-plus Brooks sneakers, $16 See's candies, and little Geico stuff dolls like this, which set me back about $5. $5, it's still $5.",

They're listening to everything you have to say about what we're going to be expecting here over the next 48 hours or so. But Soz, I'm curious just from your perspective, what are you most looking forward to tomorrow?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Me, I'm very curious. That's a good question, Seana. I'm very curious on how Buffett, his stamina is on stage. What is he talking about? How does he sound at the beginning of the conference, at the end of the conference? So just things you don't necessarily pick up on on a transcript.",
			"And of course, everything that he has to say about big banks obviously, very much in focus. Also on Paramount, Warren Buffett went out in November 2022, picked up a large stock of the Paramount shares, upped his stake in the company earlier this year. And they surprised. Paramount surprised investors with a really bad earnings report yesterday.",
			"They cut their dividend. And the stock went way down. A lot of people that I have talked to say Warren Buffett does not like surprises. So I'm curious to see if he comes back and fires at Paramount. But again, lots of things I am looking out for. But coming up next, one thing I'm looking out for, I mentioned Brooks running shoes.",

He keeps buying back stock-- buying stocks personally. They own Master Plan Communities. It's a great asset play.",

			"OMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) - One of Berkshire Hathaway Inc's longest-serving directors said Greg Abel has the ability and commitment to its culture that makes him an ideal fit to lead the $700 billion-plus conglomerate now run by Warren Buffett, but that a transition isn't likely to happen soon.",
			"Questions about how long Buffett, 92, and his vice chairman Charlie Munger, 99, will be around to steer Berkshire, and how the Omaha, Nebraska-based company will manage a change to new leadership, have long been on investors' minds.",
			"Ronald Olson, a Berkshire director since 1997, at an investing conference on Thursday said the company’s directors were satisfied that Abel - designated in 2021 as Buffett’s successor — has the ability to lead after the billionaire investing legend is no longer in charge.",
			"Abel has \"made very, very savvy investment decisions\" and will have a \"wide berth\" to continue once he takes the company’s helm, Olson said.",
			"But Olson added that Abel is likely “a good number of years off” from taking over, with Buffett and Munger still on board.",
			"Olson said Munger's brain \"is as good as it ever was\" and Buffett's energy was the same. \"Don't count on Greg to take it over tomorrow.\"",
			"Abel, 60, has since 2018 been a vice chairman overseeing Berkshire's non-insurance businesses including the BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which he used to run. Buffett publicly designated him as his likely successor as CEO in 2021, after Munger appeared to let slip the board's thinking at that year's annual meeting. Olson spoke ahead of this year's meeting on Saturday. After Buffett departs, Berkshire is expected to name his eldest son Howard as non-executive chairman to preserve its culture, where business units operate essentially without interference from the top. Abel will also have to decide the extent to which two portfolio managers who handle small pieces of Berkshire's stock investments, with Buffett handling big investments such as Apple Inc, take over more of the portfolio, Olson said. Upon becoming CEO, Abel would likely experience \"more formality\" in his relationship with directors than Buffett, who took over in 1965, now has. Still, Olson is certain Berkshire tapped the right person to take it forward. \"The bottom line is, not only is Warren satisfied, Charlie is satisfied that Greg ... will carry out that culture,\" he continued. \"On top of that, he has had a lot of knowledge. Very close to Warren, less so than Charlie, but enough.\"",

It's something Squeri views as a \"privilege.\"",
			"That special access is in sharp contrast to when Squeri first dined with the Berkshire Hathaway (<a class=\"link\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" data-ylk=\"slk:BRK;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BRK-A\">BRK</a>) chairman, known as the \"Oracle of Omaha,\" many years ago.",

			"\"Fortunately, Ken [former AmEx CEO Ken Chenault] was there, and there were other people there. But I looked at that and I said to myself here I am – and I'm senior vice president at the time, which is one of our top 120 people in the company – and in what world did I ever believe I'd be sitting down and having lunch with Warren Buffett. I remember calling my dad and saying, 'I just had lunch with Warren Buffett!'\"",
			"About five years into his tenure as head of AmEx, Squeri more fully understands the business and investing magic of billionaire Buffett. The Berkshire Hathaway boss's approach has led to his being a very long-term investor in AmEx, one who has been handsomely rewarded as the financial services company has grown.",
			"The veteran investor's interest in AmEx began in the early 1960s when, in classic Buffett form, he smelled a lucrative opportunity in the heart of a crisis.",
			"In 1963, Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Company founder Anthony De Angelis used its inventory as collateral for loans from more than 50 entities, including AmEx. De Angelis used these loans to drive up prices in the soybean oil market and increase the value of Allied.",
			"Eventually, a whistleblower came forward claiming that Allied was misleading AmEx to get more loans, by filling up oil tanks with water. This was proven to be true, and De Angelis filed for bankruptcy and went to prison for seven years. The impropriety became known as the \"<a class=\"link yahoo-link\" data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" data-ylk=\"slk:salad-oil scandal;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bill-ackman-wants-us-remember-154454835.html\">salad-oil scandal</a>\" and prompted concerns on Wall Street, given AmEx had to pay Allied's bill.",
			"Buffett used the opportunity to acquire 5% of AmEx for roughly $20 million.",
			"The credit-card boom of the 1970s and 1980s made AmEx a top player in the market. By the late 1990s, <a class=\"link\" data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" data-ylk=\"slk:two-thirds;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://money.usnews.com/credit-cards/articles/the-history-of-credit-cards#:~:text=two%2Dthirds%20did%20in%201998%2C%20according%20to%20the%20Federal%20Reserve%27s%20Surveys%20of%20Consumer%20Finances.\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">two-thirds</a> of American households had a payments card.",

Within seven years, he<strong> </strong>owned more than 50 million shares of the company.",
			"Berkshire Hathaway hasn't purchased any AmEx stock since the late 1990s, but its stake has continued to increase as a result of stock buybacks. Today, Buffett has a $23 billion-plus stake in AmEx, equaling 20.4% ownership.",
			"Shares of AmEx have climbed from around $2.50 in early 1980 to more than $152 currently.",
			"AmEx has more than 77 million cards in service worldwide. Wall Street analysts expect AmEx to post $8.2 billion in net profits this year, which would be up handsomely from $4.8 billion in 2016.",
			"Squeri has seen the best investing magic of Buffett in the past few years: an unbridled focus on the long term, no matter what is happening in the present day.",
			"\"I talked to him [early on in the pandemic] and said to him that, 'Look, the reality is we're probably not going to have a great year. I mean we could actually lose money this year,'\" Squeri said.",
			"\"As we went through this, he said: 'I don't care about this year, and I don’t care about next year. What I care about is that you keep the brand special, that you continue to invest in the brand, and that you retain your customers,'\" he added.",
			"Those touchstones are at the heart of Buffett's approach, according to Squeri.",
			"\"He looks for good businesses that are sustainable. And he doesn't react to the peaks and valleys. When you have an investor that is focused on the long to medium term like he is, it is easy to make the right decisions for the business.\"",
			"Buffett's long-term horizon has allowed Squeri more \"freedom\" to test his ideas as CEO, without fear of the rebuke that often comes from investors more focused on the short term.",
			"The AmEx CEO says he isn't concerned some of the Buffett magic will fade once the veteran investor steps aside as Berkshire Hathaway CEO and hands the reins to likely successor Greg Abel.",
			"\"Warren has selected someone who is philosophically aligned with him. And my anticipation is that things will continue as they are,\" Squeri said.",

			"In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.",
			"Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.",
			"<b>Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR</b>",
			"Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.",
			"The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",
			"Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.",
			"In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.",
			"In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.",
			"Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.",
			"<b>Is JPM Worth Investing In?</b>",
			"In terms of earnings estimate revisions for JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 11.5% over the past month to $14.33.",
			"Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.",
			"The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;",
			"Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. may serve as a useful guide for investors.",

			"With that in mind, let's take a look at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.'s main business drivers.",
			"Headquartered in New York, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. is one of the biggest global banks with assets valued at $3.74 trillion and stockholders’ equity worth $303.1 billion as of Mar 31, 2023. With operations in more than 60 countries, the company (incorporated under Delaware law in 1968) is one of the largest financial service firms in the world.<br/><br/>JPMorgan organizes its business through following five reportable segments:",

It offers global investment management in equities, fixed income, real estate, hedge funds, private equity and liquidity including money market instruments and bank deposits. The segment also offers trust and estate, banking and brokerage services.<br/><br/>Corporate segment (0.1%) consists of Treasury &amp; Chief Investment Office (CIO) and Other Corporate, which includes corporate staff units and centrally managed expenses.",
			"<b>Bottom Line</b>",
			"Anyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.",
			"A $1000 investment made in May 2013 would be worth $2,819.42, or a 181.94% gain, as of May 5, 2023, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.",
			"Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 151.56% and gold's return of 34.03% over the same time frame.",
			"Analysts are anticipating more upside for JPM.",
			"JPMorgan's shares have outperformed the industry over the past six months. The company acquired failed First Republic Bank for $10.6 billion, which is expected to be accretive to earnings. The deal adds almost $173 billion in loans and will increase market share among wealthy clients. Higher rates, global expansion initiatives and a steady loan demand will support net interest income (NII). Our estimates for NII (managed) imply a CAGR of 6.7% by 2025. Yet, the volatile nature of the capital markets business and higher mortgage rates are likely to make fee income growth challenging. We expect non-interest income (managed) to fall 2.6% in 2023. Mounting expenses pose a major headwind, and we anticipate the same to rise 6.7% in 2023. Given the potential recession, provisions are likely to keep rising. We project the same to jump 43.5% in 2023.",
			"The stock is up 5.22% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 12 higher, for fiscal 2023. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.",

			"Thank you, Karen. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. <br/>BILL delivered strong profitable growth for the third quarter as we executed on our strategy to be the essential financial operations platform for SMBs. Revenue in Q3 grew 63% year-over-year, driven by broad strength across our diversified revenue streams. We also made significant progress growing non-GAAP net income, which was $59 million for the quarter, reflecting a margin of 22%. At the end of Q3, more than 450,000 businesses used BILL to automate their financial operations and generate $65 billion in payment volume during the quarter. <br/>We are pleased with our Q3 results amidst an external environment that included significant macro uncertainty and a banking crisis. Our financial performance and scale are a testament to the value of our platform and ecosystem. <br/>Consistent with earlier indicators from the last 2 quarters, SMBs are moderating their expenditures in this tough macro environment and continuing to focus on doing more with less. In Q3, customers were highly engaged with our platform and made a similar number of transactions on a year-over-year basis, yet reduced their expenditures per transaction as belt tightening continued. <br/>We know that BILL is the center of our customers' day-to-day financial operations. Our platform enables process automation from the moment a bill is received all the way through to syncing completed transaction with the accounting system. Customers leverage our solutions to operate more efficiently and gain increased visibility into their cash flows. A great example of how we help companies transform their financial operations and gain efficiency is Anchored Tiny Homes, a family-owned homebuilding business in Fair Oaks, California, that leverages our accounts payable and spend management solutions. <br/>Cindy Morton, Financial Controller said, and I quote, \"We never knew managing our finances to be this easy. We went from having no understanding of which checks were outstanding to having a real-time view of our cash position. With 35 Divvy cards in use, we know exactly who has made each purchase and have an accurate picture of costs associated with individual homebuilding projects. With BILL, we are able to take on more clients. In the past year, we went from 60 active construction projects to 140 at any time. BILL and Divvy completely renovated our financial operations.\"<br/>Our platform enables customers like Anchored Tiny Homes to connect with millions of network members regardless of which accounting system or bank they use. We have built a large-scale 2-sided network that simplifies operations and offers automation and multiple payment choices for both sides of a transaction within a secure and frictionless experience. Today, roughly 1/3 of BILL stand-alone platform core revenue is generated by suppliers in our network who choose to accept virtual card, instant transfer, international payments and now, in beta invoice financing. Leveraging the breadth of our platform, we believe there is significant long-term growth ahead to drive further network member acquisition and ad valorem payment adoption. Every new member that we add to our network increases platform engagement, thereby enabling additional value creation across the platform. <br/>Our platform is the central hub that facilitates millions of transactions each month for billions of dollars. We have built an always-on platform with 24/7 availability in order to deliver the financial peace of mind SMBs need. This means we have created redundancy through integrations with multiple payment processors to ensure consistency and reliability. BILL's world-class infrastructure and operational capabilities were demonstrated during the recent banking crisis. <br/>Today at the Silicon Valley Bank closure, we committed to our customers that we would stand behind all pending transactions regardless of the ultimate resolution of the bank situation. We seamlessly redirected SVB-bond transactions to another financial institution partner so that transactions continued uninterrupted. We also helped impacted businesses stay operational by utilizing our suite of products. We offered a new way for customers to access capital by preapproving lines of credit through Divvy, provide a solution for debit card users to connect their cards to our pay-by-card offering and expanded access to BILL balance to secure a convenient place to store funds and make fast payments. <br/>Recognizing that businesses want to manage all their spend in one place, we continue to work on creating an integrated customer experience, blending the best of BILL and our acquired solutions. Recently, we unified the look and feel of our Divvy and BILL solutions across our web and mobile apps. Later this year, our platform will power a cohesive and consistent experience and customers will have a significantly enhanced view of cash inflows, outflows and open tasks all in one place. <br/>The consolidated view will enable businesses to gain a more complete picture of their finances and further control their financial operations. By offering enhanced in product discovery and simplified self-service product adoption, we believe that we will further unlock our sizable cross-sell opportunity. In addition, we are enhancing our accountant dashboard, making it easier for our 6,000-plus accounting firm partners to offer more of our products and provide more strategic value-added services to their clients. <br/>We are also continuing to leverage our expertise in developing AI capabilities that make our solutions easier to use, more automated and predicted. We were an early adopter of AI, applying it to our large data asset for reading invoices, enabling suppliers, detecting risks and managing documents. In addition, we are working on ways that BILL can leverage generative AI capabilities to enhance customer experiences. <br/>Turning now to the people front. Ken Moss recently joined our executive team as Chief Technology Officer. We're excited to have another seasoned executive on the team with experience enabling breakthrough technology at speed and scale. Ken brings decades of innovation and leadership experience to BILL, including 8 years of CTO at Electronic Arts, where he led the company through a cloud-based transition and pioneered broad uses of data in AI to improve the game creator and player experience. He also led technology strategies at eBay, connecting millions of buyers with sellers to enable online commerce, and at Microsoft, he oversaw development and engineering with key teams. Ken will be taking over from Vinay Pai, who is retiring. <br/>In closing, we delivered another great quarter with strong revenue growth and expanding profitability while creating value for hundreds of thousands of SMBs. With our robust platform that automates financial operations and offers a variety of payment and funding choices, BILL serves as a financial nervous system for SMBs and connects them with millions of network members. I'd like to thank our customers and partners for the trust they place in us, and I'd also like to thank the BILL team for their strong commitment to serving SMBs. <br/>I'll now turn the call over to John to talk in more detail about our quarter.",
			"<strong>John R. Rettig</strong>",
			"Thanks, Rene. Today, I'll provide an overview of our fiscal third quarter 2023 financial results and discuss our outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2023. <br/>In Q3, we delivered strong financial results that were well ahead of our estimates, driven by strength across our multiple revenue streams. Total revenue grew 63% year-over-year and non-GAAP gross margin was 87%, our highest margin on record. Non-GAAP net income was $59 million or 22% of revenue, which expanded approximately 2.5 percentage points quarter-over-quarter. In addition, we delivered our third consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow, which totaled $84 million year-to-date through March. <br/>Our strong performance highlights the strength of our diversified business model and our commitment to deliver balanced growth and profitability. Our results were delivered amidst the backdrop of multiple challenges being faced by SMBs, most notably the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, and to a lesser extent, the banking uncertainty that materialized in March. <br/>Many of the changing B2B spend patterns that we saw last year continued in Q3. Even though customers continue to face challenging business conditions and are reducing their expenditures, engagement with our platform remains strong and shows that SMBs drive value from our solutions throughout any business cycle. For example, on our BILL stand-alone platform, excluding financial institution channel customers or FIs, the average number of transactions per customer was 74, consistent with the March quarter a year ago. Of these payments, approximately 80% were repeat transactions, consistent with prior periods. Repeat transactions are defined as payments initiated between the same subscriber and vendor within the preceding 3 months. <br/>Turning to an update on our key metrics and financial results in Q3. We ended the third quarter with 455,300 businesses using our solutions. BILL stand-alone customers grew to 197,900, up 35% year-over-year. Net new customer adds on our BILL stand-alone platform were 15,200, which set a new record. This includes 3,700 net adds from our direct and accounting channels, which was up slightly from last quarter. Net adds in the FI channel were 11,500. <br/>Looking ahead to Q4, we expect fewer net customer adds in the FI channel due to Bank of America electing to sunset the BILL-powered legacy ACH and check BILL pay solution used by their commercial customer segment. We have transitioned many of the most active BofA commercial customers to our direct-to-bill platform where we will be able to deliver an enhanced experience and many more payment choices, including our ad valorem payment and spend management offerings. Note this will be a onetime impact on our customer count, and this transition does not impact our partnership with BofA focused on their small business segment. <br/>For our Divvy spend management solution, we ended the quarter with 27,100 spending businesses, an increase of 2,400 from last quarter. <br/>Moving on to payment volume. During the quarter, we processed $64.7 billion in TPV, well ahead of our expectations which assumed the TPV trends we saw late in the December quarter would continue in the seasonally soft March quarter. BILL stand-alone total payment volume was $61 billion in Q3, reflecting 11% growth from Q3 of last year and a decrease of 4% sequentially, which was slightly below historical trends. In addition, in Q3, we also had $3.4 billion in card payment volume from our spend and expense management product, representing 63% year-over-year growth. <br/>Moving on to transaction volumes, we processed 21.4 million payments in Q3. This includes 10.9 million payments on the BILL stand-alone platform and 10.2 million spend management card transactions. Total transaction revenue per transaction was $8.09, reflecting growth of 12% year-over-year. For card payments processed through our spend management solution in Q3, we generated a gross take rate of approximately 262 basis points. <br/>Now I'll review our reported Q3 results. Total revenue was $272.6 million, an increase of 63% from a year ago. Core revenue, which includes subscription and transaction revenue, was $239.5 million, representing growth of 45% year-over-year. Subscription revenue increased to $66.7 million, up 28% year-over-year. BILL stand-alone subscription revenue was $57.6 million, reflecting growth of 33% year-over-year, driven by our expanding customer base and a price increase implemented in our direct and accounting channels over the last few quarters. <br/>Transaction revenue increased to $172.8 million, up 52% year-over-year as a result of increased spend management card volume, strong ad valorem payment adoption and TPV growth. BILL stand-alone transaction revenue totaled $83.2 million, reflecting growth of 41%year-over-year and Divvy transaction revenue totaled $88.6 million, reflecting growth of 65% year-over-year. Float revenue was $33.1 million. Our yield was 429 basis points in the quarter. <br/>Shifting to gross margin and our operating results for Q3. Non-GAAP gross margin was 87%, up 2.4 percentage points year-over-year as a result of higher float revenue and increasing variable transaction fee revenue. The last few quarters, we've had a very favorable payment mix and a tailwind from high-margin float revenue which has resulted in peak non-GAAP gross margin which we would expect to moderate in the next few quarters. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $202.3 million, an increase of just 4% from Q2 due to proactive expense management, including reducing our pace of hiring and closely managing our variable spend. Rewards costs, which are included in sales and marketing expenses were 48% of spend management card revenue compared to 50% in the prior quarter. <br/>Non-GAAP operating income was $34.8 million, an increase of $40.5 million year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 12.8%, an improvement of 16 percentage points year-over-year. Non-GAAP other income net of other expenses was $25.4 million and benefited from higher yields on corporate cash and investment portfolios. Our non-GAAP net income was $58.7 million or 22% of revenue, resulting in non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.50, based on $117.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Our non-GAAP net income was significantly ahead of our estimates due to revenue outperformance combined with our disciplined approach to managing expenses as we scale. <br/>Moving on to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of Q3 were $2.7 billion. We are well capitalized and focused on continuing to invest in our platform to serve more needs of SMBs. Our track record of investing in organic and inorganic opportunities and translating those investments into efficient growth is a playbook that we will continue to deploy. With our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation, we are in a position to allocate capital for both investing for growth and reducing dilution through our share buyback program. <br/>In March, we repurchased 359,000 shares for $27 million at an average price of $75.22 per share. As of March 31, we had approximately $273 million of share repurchase authority remaining. <br/>Before shifting to our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2023, I'd like to share our view on how we see the macro environment impacting SMBs and our business. While we've seen initial signs of spend trends beginning to stabilize, we anticipate that the challenging macro environment and tightening credit conditions in the near term will translate into customers continuing to reduce spend from the elevated levels of the pandemic years. <br/>For the BILL stand-alone platform, we expect Q4 TPV to be roughly flat to Q3 and down slightly on a per customer basis quarter-over-quarter. While the cyclical headwinds will likely persist in the near term, we are optimistic about the strong secular trends driving digital transformation and we're confident in our ability to achieve our long-term aspiration to serve millions of businesses. Through our platform and payment offerings, we are driving robust customer engagement and strong ad valorem adoption. We are innovating at a rapid pace to create more value for SMBs and to further differentiate ourselves. <br/>Now turning to our outlook. For fiscal Q4, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $277 million to $280 million, which reflects 38% to 40% year-over-year growth. As a reminder, our recent subscription price increase is now in our run rate numbers, and as a result, we expect a smaller sequential subscription revenue increase compared to recent history. We expect float revenue to be $32 million in Q4, which assumes our yield on FBO funds will be approximately 410 basis points. <br/>On the bottom line, for Q4, we expect to report non-GAAP net income in the range of $45.4 million to $48.4 million and non-GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of $0.39 to $0.41 and based on a share count of 117.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For Q4, we expect other income net of other expenses, or OIE, to be $24 million. We expect stock-based compensation expenses of approximately $64 million in Q4, and we expect capital expenditures of approximately $11 million to $12 million. <br/>Moving on to full year guidance. For fiscal 2023, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $1.039.5 billion to $1.042.5 billion, which represents 62% year-over-year growth. We expect float revenue to be $109 million in fiscal 2023, which assumes a yield on FBO funds of approximately 350 basis points for the year. We expect to report non-GAAP net income for fiscal year 2023 in the range of $170.4 million to $173.4 million. We expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be $1.46 to $1.48 based on a share count of 117 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. <br/>In closing, with our platform, ecosystem and scale, we are well positioned to capture a large market opportunity to transform financial operations for millions of SMBs. We have an efficient multi-revenue stream business that enables us to invest in driving innovation and value creation for our customers while delivering significant revenue growth, non-GAAP profitability and free cash flow for our investors. <br/>Operator, we're now ready to take questions.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) We have the first question from Andrew Schmidt of Citi Group.",
			"<strong>Andrew Garth Schmidt</strong>",
			"I wanted to ask about just the spend trends in terms of just a stabilization comment. It's good to hear about just the comment about stabilization, but it does sound like you're expecting kind of more moderation. So maybe you could kind of reconcile what you're seeing currently versus how you're setting up kind of the outlook? Any comments about just what you're seeing in the environment would be helpful.",
			"<strong>Rene A. Lacerte</strong>",
			"Super happy with the quarter, and in part because the deterioration that we had seen at the end of the last quarter did not continue as strongly into this quarter, and so that's the comment around stabilization. And what we saw, what that really tells us is that once again, we have proven and seen in the proven capability that SMBs have to be resilient. They've really worked hard to be able to manage their business, they use our platform to be able to do that. And that, being able to manage through uncertainty, is something that we feel very comfortable that we can help SMBs do and we started to see that across the platform. <br/>In addition, we continue to see great execution across our business, and that enabled us to drive opportunities to support our customers in multiple ways to be able to drive monetization across the platform, to be able to drive customer growth, one of the strongest quarters ever for us for total net new adds, around 15,200. So all of that in this macro environment, I would say, bodes well for our future. <br/>I don't know if, John, if you have anything else to say on this.",
			"<strong>John R. Rettig</strong>",
			"No, I think that was good. We did expect heading into the quarter that some of the trends we saw materialized late in the December quarter, which was a pretty sizable drop off in spend. As businesses were reacting to the macro environment and reducing expenses, we had assumed that those trends would continue in the quarter and it proved to be conservative, frankly. We ended up with TPV of 11% year-over-year growth versus our initial estimates of being flat and down slightly quarter-to-quarter, which is pretty consistent with normal seasonal trends. So we feel really good about the strength of the SMB customer base we have and the utility that the platform is providing for our customers.",
			"<strong>Andrew Garth Schmidt</strong>",
			"And Rene, maybe I could sneak one more in just since you mentioned the sort of the better kind of net new add profile. I remember last quarter, there were some delays in decision-making kind of SMBs pushing software decisions out. It seems like ex FI BILL net adds got a little bit better, but still under that kind of 4,000 to 5,000 mark. Are you seeing improvement in terms of the cycles there? And how should we think about sort of normalization over the next few quarters?",
			"<strong>Rene A. Lacerte</strong>",
			"One of the great things about our business is our go-to-market strategy. We have a very robust multichannel distribution approach which allows us to support businesses and small businesses wherever they may be and whatever they're looking for. Solutions to help them really automate their financial operations, and that's how we become the financial nervous system for SMBs. <br/>And so what we have continue to see is in our direct channel, we continue to see kind of the macro play out in that, the smallest businesses continue to kind of be in this wait-and-see mode versus a growth mode, and so they have waited to make decisions to add on different expenses to their business. And then when it comes to the accountants that we also serve, we see accountants being very focused on how to help their customers from a strategic perspective really drive efficiency in their business, and so they're not as busy adding new customers as we would like to see. <br/>Ultimately, this is kind of the macro condition that we talked about that when it impacts the net new ads, it's because they're focused on using our platform to manage their business today. And we believe the opportunity that we see across channels, hence what we saw with the financial institution channel, shows the robustness of our capabilities here that SMBs, when they need something, when it comes to financial operations, they're going to come to BILL.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Josh Beck.",
			"<strong>Josh J. Beck</strong>",
			"I wanted to ask a little bit about Divvy. Certainly, you've started to unify the experience with BILL. I think you were talking really across the web and mobile apps, but certainly, you seem to have more plans. So maybe just help us understand what may be some of the early learnings have been? And really, just how we should think about the cross-sell potential in the coming years?",
			"<strong>Rene A. Lacerte</strong>",
			"From the beginning, we have taken the time and placed the effort around purposely building a robust, interconnected platform that allows us to offer multiple types of payment products to our SMBs to be able to serve them as they need. And with the acquisition of Divvy, the focus has been on how do we continue to extend that platform. And so we have defined this as our unified platform, it's something that we're very focused on. <br/>And to begin that integration, we first started with unifying the data lake, if you will, being able to have the ability to see customer data across both platforms and have a single view of that. And that led us into also having a unified brand approach, which you saw that in the fall where we kind of released and shared kind of how we're thinking about branding. And what we announced this quarter is that the look and feel that customers see is actually one experience now. It's one color system, as an example, one sign on, one unified identity. <br/>That allows us to focus on the next phase, which we think is going to be an important phase to go after that sizable cross-sell opportunity that we talked about, which is to have the platforms integrated from an experience perspective, a more unified experience. Not just from a color perspective, which is the first step of look and feel, but now integrating different software features and capabilities across that unified experience. <br/>And so we are committed to getting that done this calendar year. It's been our plan all along to deliver that this calendar year, and we feel very good about where we're at in that execution of that requirement for the business, and we're excited about what that's going to mean for the cross-sell opportunity. Like we said, we really believe it is a sizable opportunity. We see from the customers that are already using both BILL and Divvy, the value they get out of it. We also see the increased usage and spend across both platforms when they work together. It becomes very, very sticky, the application and the service that we provide. And that's something that we're excited about and look forward to rolling that out later this year.",
			"<strong>Josh J. Beck</strong>",
			"And then maybe FI related question. It sounds like BofA is really zeroing in on the SMB segment for the white label option and looking to maybe put the commercial over to more of a direct relationship, so that's certainly interesting to hear. How applicable do you think this is across your broader swath of FI customers and really finding the strong product market fit within SMB in particular?",
			"<strong>Rene A. Lacerte</strong>",
			"Yes. I think the thing that we've always focused on is creating value for our partners and really being there to serve them, and so we do have multiple relations with Bank of America. We have a small business relationship and we have the commercial relationship. And when we did the commercial relationship 10 years ago, we were integrating already into what I would call a legacy platform that the bank had. And so we're at a point now where this platform, now 10 years later, the bank has made a decision to go in a different direction and sunset that legacy platform that supported, really, just the ACH and check capabilities from a BILL pay product perspective. <br/>And so from our perspective, this is kind of a one-off situation. When you look at the financial institution partners across, we continue to do more and more with all of our partners, including Bank of America. And so we think this channel is going to be super important as financial operations becomes part of the fabric of every SMB, and we're going to continue to focus on serving those FIs. We have 6 out of the top 10. We're going to continue to focus on serving them with more and more products and more capabilities.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"We now have Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.",
			"<strong>Darrin David Peller</strong>",
			"I guess if we could just start with the take rate expansion, and I know that's not -- it's more of an output than it is a direct focus necessarily. However, I know after last quarter, it didn't expand sequentially as much as you had seen before. We talked about it and you guys said there may be some areas of being more proactive on that front, whether that's supply enablement or other categories. I mean we did see a material expansion this quarter, I think roughly 3x or 2x more than it had been before sequentially. So can you just comment on what drove some of that strength? And if there are some proactive moves you're making and looking? If there's any sustainability and we can count on?",
			"<strong>Rene A. Lacerte</strong>",
			"Darrin. I'll start and then let John add some more color. <br/>First and foremost, we've built a very strong platform that allows us to use multiple levers across the business to drive monetization and more uses of our payment products. And in any given quarter, we're doing different things, experimenting, testing and driving that capability, and we've always said that it's not going to be a linear approach to get to the ultimate expansion of monetization with our customers, and this is a good example. We had a lot of great experiments that worked well for us this quarter. <br/>I'll let John kind of talk more to that.",
			"<strong>John R. Rettig</strong>",
			"We saw really strong ad valorem adoption during the quarter and that's tied into the suite of payment offerings that we have, and those are resonating with both buyers and suppliers. Specifically, we saw really good adoption and penetration with both virtual card payments and our pay-by-card solution as well as a continued mix shift with our international payment products, where we're seeing more foreign currency transactions versus U.S. dollar transactions and a lower, smaller headwind around FX losses that we called out last quarter. <br/>Looking ahead, I mean, I think it's fair to assume typical average quarterly expansion rates. Obviously subject to, there is some quarterly fluctuation here that Rene mentioned plus any sort of macro-induced behavioral changes. But we feel really good about the performance in the quarter and how the ad valorem products we have are increasingly resonating with our small business customers.",
			"<strong>Darrin David Peller</strong>",
			"I mean a very quick follow-up, just the comments you made on TPV into the next quarter. Is there an element of just macro conservatism? Are you seeing a real change in behavior on customers? Just a quick update.",
			"<strong>John R. Rettig</strong>",
			"I'd say looking ahead to this June quarter, we're assuming that the environment is going to be relatively stable, the external macro environment. And that small businesses are continuing to adjust their spend patterns and what ultimately flows through our platform as TPV in light of inflation, interest rates, credit. <br/>All of those things are continuing to force SMBs and our customers to react. So we're assuming that continues, but no significant worsening of the environment where we would see major changes from SMB. So it's kind of a continuation of the trends that we feel like we experienced in the March quarter.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"We now have Brent Bracelin of Piper Sandler.",
			"<strong>Brent Alan Bracelin</strong>",
			"Maybe I'll start with John. Core TPV clearly was stronger than expected, 3 months ago, it sounds like that was partially tied to SMB stabilization. Can you talk a little bit about linearity of the core TPV trends there on a monthly basis? And did that trend off at all in March, just given some of the regional banking issues? Just any color on linearity would be helpful.",
			"<strong>John R. Rettig</strong>",
			"First, I'd just remind everyone that the March quarter is typically seasonally softer from a spend standpoint than the December quarter. We didn't experience, in the December quarter, the normal historical, like, seasonal uptick, and so we had assumed that, that aberration would continue in the March quarter, and we really didn't see that. We saw spend trends throughout the quarter that were pretty consistent with seasonal patterns that we've seen historically. <br/>Now the overall level of spend is reduced as we -- as I mentioned before, SMBs are scaling back their spending. But the patterns throughout the quarter seem to be pretty consistent, and that's what led to our commentary about some initial signs of stabilization in spend trends.",
			"<strong>Rene A. Lacerte</strong>",
			"Just one thing I'd add, just you asked about kind of the regional bank. One of the beautiful things about our platform is that our customers can switch and add multiple bank accounts. And so for them, this was a nonevent because we stood up and we took care of our customers.",
			"<strong>Brent Alan Bracelin</strong>",
			"And then, Rene, one of the biggest questions I get from investors on Intuit. And I was wondering if you could just talk about Intuit as a partner and maybe potential competitor someday, just given the co-marketing agreement there could lapse here in June? And how you view your differentiation versus Intuit?",
			"<strong>Rene A. Lacerte</strong>",
			"First off, I would just say that the current contract is approximately 1% of the revenue of the business, so it's not material to the business. And the opportunity that we have with larger businesses, which is where we are focused, continues to prove out with our direct and our financial institutional channels. We see lots of large businesses coming on the platform so we believe in that. <br/>And so I guess what I would just say more broadly is that what may look simple from the outside is really rather difficult to build. I've been building payment solutions for SMBs for over 3 decades, and I'm not the only person on the team and the company that has decades of experience doing this. So that knowledge, that expertise, that ability to execute allows us to take the complexities of financial operations and payments and all the things that are involved with BILL Pay and we suspend management receivables and make it simple. <br/>And our ability to be able to do that is something because we've integrated all the process automation and workflow capabilities and payment capabilities into one platform. We're not just a system of record for our customers. We're also the system of engagement for our customers. And behind all of that, we have a regulatory compliance and redundancy capabilities that we showed and proved out this quarter with the March challenges in the financial regional bank world. <br/>So from our perspective, the money movement that we have at $250 billion plus on an annual basis really speaks to the complexity we have, the leadership we have, and ultimately, I would say that we're busy taking all the learnings from the customers we have, the experiences, the data and really setting the innovation agenda for tomorrow and for the next year and the year after that and so on while others are really kind of looking at what we did 2 or 3 years ago and modeling their entry into the go-to-market of financial operations with what we were doing in the past. <br/>So we're going to continue to focus on the future. We're going to continue to innovate, continue to add payment capabilities, continue to add working capital capabilities. We're going to continue to do more and more so that SMBs have less and less to worry about. We're going to take that mess off their plate and really make it go away.",

			"I think you mentioned that 3,500 net adds ex the FI channel is kind of the right number going forward. We saw a little bit of an acceleration this quarter versus last, so I'm just curious like why is 3,500 the right number? Or should this accelerate back to that kind of 5,000 type of net adds type of range? And then just any thoughts on kind of the visibility you have into this number.",
			"<strong>Rene A. Lacerte</strong>",
			"First and foremost, and I've said this many times, this is a massive opportunity. Like we have been creating and defining this category of financial operations, automating payable spend, expense and AR capabilities for our customers for a number of years, and what we see in the future is that there's so much more opportunity in front of us. What we've talked about is that the macro environment means that businesses in general are in this wait and see, not grow mode, and that means that some businesses are waiting to take on additional expense before they actually move forward with the opportunities to create more efficiency. So we do think that will change as we see the other side of this economy when we could see the light at the end of the tunnel of this, wait and see. <br/>And we really believe that the multichannel distribution approach we have will continue to serve us well, that we can continue to build our customer base across all channels. And what that means is that, just as a reminder, that allows us to continue building our network. And the network customers really do provide value for every customer experience and allows us to continue to grow our direct experience as well. <br/>And I think the thing that we continue to be most excited about is just the satisfaction we see with customers and how they use the product and the time savings that they have and all the things that we do. So we believe there's a bigger opportunity that we're going to continue to grow and work on and leverage the simplicity capabilities that we're learning every day to make this more available to more customers.",
			"<strong>Kenneth Christopher Suchoski</strong>",
			"And I guess just as my follow-up question. If we put the FI channel to the side for a second, we look at the business ex-FI, the TPV per customer was down just 5% year-over-year. It was down 7% year-over-year last quarter, and it sounds like you're feeling better about the macro. So do you think that year-over-year change in TPV per customer ex-FI has troughed? And can you talk about how we should think about the normalized growth of this metric over the medium term and just the building blocks of that?",
			"<strong>John R. Rettig</strong>",
			"Good question. You're right on the stats there. We felt pretty good about the trends in the quarter in TPV and starting to see what looked like a little more normal patterns. But I think it's early to call a trough or a reversion to growth mode. As Rene mentioned, businesses seem to be still scaling back, so we would expect -- and our estimates for Q4 reflect this, we expect softer spend in the near term. <br/>Over the intermediate term, I think there's still a lot of dependencies on the macro environment and what's happening with interest rates and the credit situation out there. So we'll certainly have more visibility into some of these patterns by the time we get to our August FY '24 call and we'll definitely update everyone then.",

			"We now have Taylor McGinnis from UBS.",
			"<strong>Taylor Anne McGinnis</strong>",
			"Maybe just to piggyback off the last question. When we think about the stabilization that you're seeing with SMBs reacting to the macro post-December, anything you can share on the mix of that spend in terms of what might be more discretionary versus fixed? And is the stabilization that you guys are seeing at all a reflection of that mix maybe being more -- at a more favorable level potentially today?",
			"<strong>Rene A. Lacerte</strong>",
			"Yes. I think this really is -- thank you, Taylor, for the question. This really is the macro, this wait and see is something that businesses are tightening. <br/>Just one perspective maybe to think about is that we serve a broad swath of the economy, right? We have businesses of all sizes, all segments, and so we see and have insights into spend across businesses and across industries that we think is unique. And one of the things that is consistent is no matter what the industry is, is that larger businesses have more discretionary spend and they tighten more of their belt than smaller businesses. And so what that means is that the impact on our overall TPV, even though all businesses are tightening, is impacted more by the larger businesses on the platform, which would make sense. <br/>And so what we're starting to see is that, we're the early signs of it stabilizing. I think we need a little bit more data before we say any more about it, but that's really -- what we think is the platform enables businesses to manage their spend, be thoughtful about it, and they're in a better position when they're on BILL than when they're not.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"We now have William Nance of Goldman Sachs.",
			"<strong>William Alfred Nance</strong>",
			"I wanted to kind of follow up on the point that you made on the BofA partnership. With those customers moving from the BofA channel to the direct channel, I guess could you put some parameters around just how large of a move in customers we're talking about here? <br/>And then we generally think about the monetization in the direct channel as being significantly higher than the FI channel. Is that something that we're going to see in the near term as these customers come over? And could you kind of talk about how that might differ between upfront movements in subscription versus transaction revenue?",
			"<strong>Rene A. Lacerte</strong>",
			"Great question. I think the first thing I would kind of call out is that we have a very strong partnership with the bank, and it's because of the strength of that partnership that we've been able to work with them on helping those customers make a decision about migrating and migrating over. And already, we've seen many of the customers that are active migrate to our platform and it's only been -- May 1 was the effective date that the bank set out. So it's very, very early for us, but we feel good that many of the active customers are coming over. <br/>And to your point, those customers when they come over, they have the ability to leverage all of our payment capabilities. And so that could be anything from virtual card, which is kind of built into the direct experience, to instant transfer to cross-border payments to working capital invoice financing. These are all things that we know will drive the ARPU up on those customers and we expect that will be an important contributor for us in the future relative to the relationship overall. And it's something that we're happy to serve the customers and make sure that we're delivering for them.",
			"<strong>William Alfred Nance</strong>",
			"And then maybe just a question on working capital. I think you guys have been rolling that out. Could you talk about just kind of where we are and any initial thoughts around how you think about attach rates in that product and what that might look like over time?",
			"<strong>Rene A. Lacerte</strong>",
			"So let me start, and then I'll let John add some additional color. The way we think about things is to always build something that's going to be robust, stand the test of time, deliver for customers, deliver for shareholders. And so as we roll this out into our beta program, we are learning about what it is that customers want, how to actually manage the capabilities that we have. <br/>And what we see so far has us encouraged about the opportunity in the future, we're going to continue to work on rolling that out and making sure that contributes in a way to the customers' experience as well as our financial experience. <br/>So John, anything else?",
			"<strong>John R. Rettig</strong>",
			"Yes, just a quick follow-up to that. One of the things that we previously mentioned is that we're in the middle of the transaction flow with our platform. We see the vast majority of B2B spend with our customers on our platform, and we think it's a perfect spot to offer alternatives that help improve cash flow and liquidity for customers. That was our thesis in rolling out this product initially, and we've been testing and learning. <br/>It's still very small. I wouldn't say we're at full launch yet. The feedback has been very positive, and we're starting to be able to validate many of the initial assumptions that we had about product adoption and repeat usage and things of that nature. <br/>So I'd say we're a ways away from the scaling phase on that product but we believe it can be a really interesting product. Perhaps in the near term, not something that moves the needle overall for our business. But over the longer term, we think it'll be a really nice addition to our ad valorem portfolio.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley.",
			"<strong>Unidentified Analyst</strong>",
			"It's [Jonathan] on for Keith. Can you help unpack where across your customer base you're seeing strength in ad valorem adoption? Does it resonate more with larger SMBs, smaller SMBs, perhaps middle market?",
			"<strong>Rene A. Lacerte</strong>",
			"We see -- really kind of depends probably on the product, right? Larger businesses, for example, have more cross-border payments so there's definitely strength there. But then you think about our working capital invoice acceleration and our instant transfers, that would be more across the supplier network that we built. One of the things we shared in the script is that around 30% of the revenue is driven by those connections in our network that allow suppliers to choose how they want to get paid and when they want to get paid, so we see the virtual card product is something that goes across all of our direct customers. And so we see strength across all customer segments there. <br/>And I think it's, again, just a testament and a proof point across the durability of our business and the strength across the business that we have these levers to pull depending on what the customer needs and when they need it, and I think that's something we've worked hard to build. It's not something that happens overnight. It's something that it takes many years to build to do it properly, and we're very happy and proud of the results we have today.",
			"<strong>Unidentified Analyst</strong>",
			"As a follow-up, you briefly touched on this before, but can you talk through the traction you're seeing in the go-to-market motion, especially in this environment? And whether the 3-month free trials that were offered had any impact there?",
			"<strong>Rene A. Lacerte</strong>",
			"Yes. At a holistic perspective, we definitely believe that the macro environment is a headwind for customer adoption right now. And that's really because smaller businesses are not looking to increase any of their expenses now while they wait and see what's going to happen with the economy, and we see that across the direct business. We see that in the accounting channel where accountants are very focused on supporting the existing customers managing the uncertainty in the macro environment. Accountants also have a challenge with labor. They need more people to be able to add more clients and serve their more businesses, so that's also a factor out there. <br/>What we're seeing at play for us is that the multichannel distribution means that we get more awareness and more opportunities to interact with more businesses because of the financial institution strategy, because of the accounting strategy, because of our direct strategy, and that's what's playing out really well for us. The fact that we have multiple ways to serve customers, and that allows us to build a stronger and stronger network, which allows us to create a stronger experience for our customers across the platform.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"We now have Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.",
			"<strong>Bryan Connell Keane</strong>",
			"Just a clarification on TPV. Seasonal patterns held in third quarter '23 but the guidance for 4Q TPV growth now suggests that seasonally, it will be materially different than last year. And I know there was some conservatism, I guess, baked into flat growth of TPV on the core BILL, and we did 11% year-over-year in the quarter. So just trying to think about is it finally the slowdown? How conservative it is versus are we really seeing the slowdown seasonally to kind of guide to those levels?",
			"<strong>John R. Rettig</strong>",
			"I'd say the December quarter, the way spend patterns played out was, it was a clear deviation from historical seasonality. The March quarter looked a lot closer to normal seasonal trends. Now our TPV performance, on a quarter-to-quarter basis, down 5% or so on a -- per customer was a little bit larger of a decline than we would typically see, and so we've assumed that the Q4 time period is going to be similar performance. We're going to see some trends that are still not quite back to normal seasonal patterns. <br/>At some point, when we get to a true trough or businesses start to expand again is when I think we get back to these historical seasonal trends even if it's at a lower overall level of spend, and I think that's still probably a few quarters out. But for Q4, we feel like the trends that we've outlined with our estimates are sort of a continuation of the trends we've seen in the March, and to a lesser extent, December quarters.",
			"<strong>Bryan Connell Keane</strong>",
			"Yes, I was going to ask that question about visibility. When will that turn take place to get back to what you think will be seasonal trends? Is that the first half of fiscal year '24? Or is that probably not until the second half?",
			"<strong>John R. Rettig</strong>",
			"It's a good question. I'd say it's difficult for us to estimate with precision from here given some of the dependencies on the external environment, including interest rates and in the credit environment for small businesses. But what we have seen is, I'd say, you could characterize it as a healthier set of patterns from businesses. They are adjusting. They are, obviously, the small business segment is super resilient, and we continue to see very high engagement with the platform. So that tells us there's good things ahead, but when that starts to turn, I think it's still open.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"We now have Brad Sills with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.",
			"<strong>Bradley Hartwell Sills</strong>",
			"I wanted to ask a question around the take rate this quarter. Obviously, real strong here. I think, John, in the past, you said perhaps with the macro, you could see some pressure, a little bit more price sensitivity on -- from suppliers, in particular, taking on virtual card. It doesn't appear to be the case. We saw a nice ramp this quarter, looks like a full basis point. So just curious what were you expecting heading into the quarter with regard to the macro impact on the uptake on ad valorem services? And then how did the quarter shape out relative to your expectations?",
			"<strong>John R. Rettig</strong>",
			"We feel really good about the performance in the quarter and the adoption of our ad valorem products. The value proposition continues to resonate. There's more of an emphasis on the part of suppliers around access to cash and speed of payments and many of our products establish that value proposition, and so I think that's gone really well. We see it with virtual card adoption on the part of larger suppliers. <br/>Our pay by card solution, while it's still small in the overall universe of payment offerings that we have, is increasingly seeing adoption. And then we continue to see very healthy levels of international transactions, international payments, which includes the FX transaction as well. So all of those things seem to be going in the right direction this quarter. <br/>And as we've said on prior calls, there is definitely some quarter-to-quarter fluctuation that happened so it's not perfectly linear, our expansion. And so we would expect looking ahead that our normal average quarterly growth rates and monetization are probably a good proxy for what we expect going forward, subject to any quarter-to-quarter variation that might exist.",
			"<strong>Bradley Hartwell Sills</strong>",
			"And one more, if I may, please. We're hearing real positive feedback from the channel on the potential for Divvy integration with core BILL. Curious, any thoughts on the progress there and what that might do for the potential cross-sell of Divvy into BILL and BILL into Divvy?",
			"<strong>Rene A. Lacerte</strong>",
			"We are definitely hearing the same thing when we talk with all of our joint customers that use both the spend and expense platform that we have from Divvy and the BILL -- core BILL platform. They definitely talk to the value that it is to have all the spend in one place. It's actually one of the things that allows us to think more confidently about how things are moving for businesses across America. <br/>And so from our perspective, the sizable cross-sell opportunity is really going to unlock once we have this fully integrated experience. So we're a good part of the way there. We've done all the heavy lifting underneath the covers to kind of make the platforms talk to each other, to look like one platform, and now, we just got to create that execution. So your checks are the same as ours that customers love the value of both, and we're going to continue to make sure that that's true, and then obviously execute when we get into cross-selling motion.",

			"We now have Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.",
			"<strong>Tien-Tsin Huang</strong>",
			"I know you've covered a lot already. A lot of good answers. <br/>Just wanted to ask a couple of clarifications on the gross margin. It was very, very strong. John, you mentioned moderate. I think I heard a lot about monetization, et cetera, but can you just explain again the factors or rank the factors that would drive that moderation? Or are there any call outs in the third quarter that maybe we missed with gross margin?",
			"<strong>John R. Rettig</strong>",
			"I'd say we obviously have had a tailwind of benefit associated with the increasing yields and float revenue associated with our FBO allowances. As interest rates start to peak potentially here in the near term, we'll see that float revenue begin to flatten versus the curve that it's been on throughout FY '23. That's been a positive benefit of, call it, 75 to 100 basis points on our non-GAAP gross margin historically. We've also had a very favorable payment mix, meaning some of the adoption gains that we've had on the high-monetizing ad valorem products have supported the higher gross margins as well. <br/>If you go back a few quarters, I think our visibility was kind of 80%, 81% non-GAAP gross margins. We've been operating well above that. We just wanted to call out that the peak margins of 87% that we had this last quarter is probably a bit higher than will be in the near term as our payment mix starts to shift and as we start to realize a smaller benefit associated with float revenue expansion.",
			"<strong>Tien-Tsin Huang</strong>",
			"And just if you don't mind clarifying. Just the Bank of America, so that commercial piece is just going to roll off, and so that's going to drive some of the difference in the user count on that basis? And then somewhat related, why is the average transaction per customer on the FI side so different than the direct?",
			"<strong>Rene A. Lacerte</strong>",
			"I'll take the second one first. The average transaction per customer is different in part because each of our financial institution partners has different segments that they serve, right? So if we just take Bank of America, we have both the small business side and we have the commercial side. The commercial side would have a much larger transaction per customer than the small business side. And so when you look across the channel, the reason it's different is because I think of the success that we're seeing with the banks, the financial institutions that serve the smaller businesses, there's more units there and that drives the overall average down. <br/>I think it also goes to the point that we provide a ton of value for our customers no matter the size, and that's why the banks work with us. And so when the bank decided to make this decision to sunset the legacy ACH and check BILL pay product that they had, they worked with us and are working with us to migrate those customers to our platform so the customers want to do that, and we've so far had good success doing that. <br/>Well, with that -- did you have one more question? Sorry. Follow-up?",
			"<strong>Tien-Tsin Huang</strong>",
			"No, nothing. I didn't know if you want -- if you already clarified the Bank of America. If not, I can go back to the transcript. But thanks for the education on that, Rene. It was helpful for me. Sorry, it's just simple question.",
			"<strong>Rene A. Lacerte</strong>",
			"Okay. No problem. Thank you. .<br/>I'd just like to say thanks to everyone for joining us today. We look forward to communicating our progress as we execute against our strategy to be the essential financial operations platform for SMBs. <br/>Thank you, and have a great evening.",

			"<span><span>Defined as new technology that seeks to improve and automate the delivery and use of financial services, the financial technology (fintech) market is forecasted to be valued at around $700 billion by 2030 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 20%.</span></span>",
			"<span><span>Currently valued at upwards of $200 billion</span></span><span>, it would be no surprise if the fintech market becomes a trillion-dollar industry in the distant future as innovation continues among financial services. This makes many fin tech stocks intriguing investments, especially for longer-term investors.</span>",
			"<span><span><strong>PayPal’s Revolution</strong></span></span>",
			"<span><span>As a brief synopsis, fintech companies strive to simplify and digitalize banking services, payment processing, peer-to-peer lending and payments, financial software, and other financial services.</span></span>",
			"<span><span>PayPal (PYPL</span></span><span><span>) is a prime example of such digitalization and how fintech companies make financial services much more convenient for consumers. Landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) there may still be better buying opportunities ahead but last year's selloff in PayPal stock has made the financial payment innovator more attractive from a valuation standpoint.</span></span>",
			"<span><span>Previously owned by eBay (EBAY</span></span><span><span>) before its spinoff in 2015, the growth of online e-commerce payments is someone attributed to PayPal. As the internal catalyst to eBay’s online payment growth, Amazon (AMZN</span></span><span><span>) and others followed suit.</span></span>",
			"<span>Despite giving back some of the gains since its 2015 IPO, PayPal stock is still up +94%. This has trailed the Nasdaq but is near the S&amp;P 500’s performance and outperformed its former parent company eBay.</span>",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span>",
			"<span>PayPal has become one of the largest online payment solution providers and is responsible for making the process much easier for consumers during its early eBay days and the rise of the internet. Prior to this, the frequent use of mailed in checks to pay for purchased items on the internet became time insensitive, outdated, and incompatible with online purchases.</span>",
			"<span>Although there is increasing competition, PayPal’s growth story is far from over. Based on Zacks estimates PayPal’s earnings are forecasted to jump 18% in FY23 and climb another 16% in FY24 at $5.69 per share.</span>",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span>",
			"<span>More impressive, fiscal 2024 would represent a very stellar 132% growth in EPS since the pandemic with 2019 earnings at $2.45 per share. PayPal’s top-line expansion also supports its earnings potential with sales forecasted to rise 6% this year and jump another 9% in FY24 to $31.85 billion.</span>",
			"<span><span>Trading at $72 per share and 14.5X forward earnings, Wall Street's concerns of a high premium being paid for PayPal stock have faded. Better still, PayPal now offers a 45% discount to its industry average of 41.1X forward earnings and trades nicely beneath the S&amp;P 500’s 18.8X.</span></span>",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span>",
			"<span>Quieting the premium fears in recent years, PayPal now trades 83% below its decade-long high of 87.8X and at a 67% discount to the median of 43.7X.</span>",
			"<span><span>PayPal’s ability to reconfirm its anticipated annual growth in its upcoming first quarter report on May 8 will be key for more upside in PYPL stock. With that being said, holding on to shares at current levels appears to be a keen way to get in on fintech expansion.</span></span>",
			"<span><span><strong>Visa &amp; Mastercard’s Transformation </strong></span></span>",
			"<span><span>Worthy of consideration for exposure to the growth of fintech is Visa (V</span></span><span><span>) &amp; Mastercard MA which both sport a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and their top and bottom lines are naturally light years ahead of newer and smaller fintech competitors.</span></span>",
			"<span><span>Newer start-up companies are often thought of in regards to fintech more so than these payment card giants but their impact on financial technology services shouldn’t be overlooked. This is especially true when considering Visa &amp; Mastercard’s reliability to consumers and their very strong stock performances over the last decade.</span></span>",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span>",
			"<span>Furthermore, innovation and expansion in the fintech space is a way for Visa and Mastercard to continue their growth as larger mature companies.</span>",
			"<span><span>Specifically, Visa and Mastercard have to be recognized as their solutions in the digital wallet are as widely accepted for online shopping as their debit and credit cards are globally. Through Visa Checkout and MasterCard’s MasterPass, both companies have transformed themselves outside of plastic and evolved with the trend and digital age of consumer shopping.</span></span>",
			"<span><span>This should help preserve and expand their top and bottom line figures for years to come. Trading at $354 a share, Mastercard sales are forecasted to rise 13% this year to $25.16 billion with earnings expected to climb 15% at $12.26 per share. Fiscal 2024 sales and earnings are anticipated to jump another 12% and 17% respectively.   </span></span>",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span>",
			"<span>Pivoting to Visa which trades at $225 a share, earnings are expected to be up 14% in FY23 at $8.57 per share with sales rising 11% this year to $32.47 billion. Fiscal 2024 sales and earnings are projected to rise another 11% and 13% respectively.</span>",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span>",
			"<strong>Block &amp; Bitcoin  </strong>",
			"<span><span>Along with PayPal, one of the more popular names in the fintech space is Block (SQ</span></span><span><span>), formerly Square. Founded in 2009 and publicly traded since 2015 Block’s notoriety came with the Square Reader, the company’s first product which simplifies point-of-sale transactions by connecting to a mobile device’s auto jack.</span></span>",
			"<span><span>Block's Square Reader has been influential for smoother person-to-person transactions and has assisted small business owners in simplifying the payment process along with its larger Square Register.</span></span>",
			"<span><span>Outside of hardware products, Block's cash app has been innovative regarding money transfers with the company also implementing banking, lending, and bitcoin trading to its online platform.</span></span>",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span>",
			"<span>Trading at $60 a share and still up +370% since going public, Block’s performance has easily topped the broader indexes during this period. Block has intentionally stuck with solely providing Bitcoin services on its platform while other fintech companies such as PayPal include trading for a variety of cryptocurrencies.</span>",
			"<span><span>Block’s sole emphasis on Bitcoin is that it's still the most-traded cryptocurrency and the company’s concentration may provide larger returns rather than diversifying at the moment. To that point, along with providing bitcoin trading Block has entered the crypto mining space as a manufacturer of bitcoin chips.</span></span>",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Refinitiv</span>",
			"<span>Notably, bitcoin prices have stabilized in recent months and Block may be a less expensive way to get concentrated exposure while also offering the diversification of its other financial services.</span>",
			"<span><span>Bitcoin derives about 50% of Block’s revenue with SQ stock landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. As Block continues its course of increased profitability more upside could be ahead with earnings projected to soar 63% in FY23 at $1.63 per share compared to EPS of $1.00 in 2022. Plus, fiscal 2024 EPS is forecasted to climb another 41%.  </span></span>",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span>",
			"<strong>Takeaway</strong>",
			"<span><span>These companies are great illustrations of how the growth in financial technology services should intrigue investors. Considering the CAGR of the fintech market is +20%, there should be plenty of upside and growth for PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, and Block stock.  </span></span>",

			"By Andrew Goudsward",
			"(Reuters) - A Jeffrey Epstein accuser suing JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co for allegedly aiding the late financier's sex trafficking of girls and women asked a judge to disqualify the bank’s law firm on Thursday, arguing it has a conflict of interest.",
			"Lawyers for the woman, who claims she was a victim of Epstein and is not named in court papers, said the judge should bar law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr from representing JPMorgan because it previously represented an anti-sex trafficking organization that supported a different Epstein accuser.",
			"A spokesperson for the firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
			"The accuser's attorneys argued that WilmerHale had learned confidential information about the case of Courtney Wild, an alleged victim of Epstein who is also a potential member of the class suing JPMorgan, according to a court filing.",
			"WilmerHale represented the anti-trafficking organization ECPAT-USA in a legal brief urging the U.S. Supreme Court to accept Wild's appeal to invalidate a 2007 non-prosecution deal between Epstein and U.S. prosecutors. The court ultimately did not take the case.",
			"A lead WilmerHale lawyer on JPMorgan’s defense team, Felicia Ellsworth, signed the Supreme Court brief. Wild’s attorneys also consulted with WilmerHale attorneys on legal strategy, Thursday's filing said.",
			"“WilmerHale is obviously undertaking a representation in which JPMorgan’s interests are materially adverse to ECPAT’s (as well as Ms. Wild’s),” the filing said.",
			"WilmerHale, a prominent Washington, D.C.-headquartered firm, is one of two firms currently defending JPMorgan in the unnamed accuser’s case and a separate lawsuit brought by the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein allegedly abused women on his private island Little St. James.",
			"Earlier on Thursday, the judge in that case allowed the U.S. Virgin Islands to serve legal papers on Google co-founder Larry Page, who has been linked to Epstein.",

			"A holding company — usually a corporation or LLC — is created for the primary business of holding a controlling interest in the securities of other companies. Oftentimes known as parent companies, holding companies are quite common <a class=\"link yahoo-link\" data-ylk=\"slk:around the world;elm:context_link;itc:0;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-holding-companies-world-180637937.html\">around the world</a>, especially when it comes to large firms operating in lucrative industries such as finance and consumer goods.",
			"Somewhat similar to hedge funds, mutual funds, and investors in that they can hold an interest in certain firms, what sets holding companies apart is that they hold a controlling stake within a company that provides them with the ability to decide management and set long-term strategic goals for the target firm. This, in turn, allows a holding company to be entitled to the profits of its subsidiaries.",
			"There are certain advantages that come with a holding company, including liability protection. Since they are relatively easy to create or change, holding companies can take advantage of geographical differences in taxation regimes. If a location has high tax taxes, the holding company can simply relocate to a more business-friendly environment while continuing operations in the original area of operation.",
			"While the picture seems rosy for holding companies, the same isn't guaranteed for their subsidiaries. As an example, a subsidiary cannot raise capital by issuing new shares, and it is also at risk if the parent runs into legal troubles. Additionally, if a subsidiary company goes bankrupt, the holding company may experience a capital loss and a decline in net worth. That said, the bankrupt company’s creditors cannot legally pursue the holding company for remuneration.",

			"<span>Large-cap stocks are those that have a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:market capitalization above $10 billion;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/large-cap.asp\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">market capitalization above $10 billion</a> and are synonymously known as big cap stocks. A company’s market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the share price by the number of shares outstanding. By that metric, all of the shares listed below qualify as large cap. Each stock listed below also pays out a dividend, providing shareholders with a dependable source of income. </span>",
			"<span>May is a great month to buy these companies despite the old adage to “sell in May and go away.” There may be a historical precedent for weaker performance during the summer, but investors in these dividend-paying large-cap stocks generate passive income year round. Investors who choose to direct their capital into the safety of large-cap <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:dividend stocks;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/stock-types/dividend-stocks/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dividend stocks</a> should consider doing so right now, at least in these names. </span>",

			"<b>Broadcom</b><span> (NASDAQ:<span><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:AVGO;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/avgo-stock-quote/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>AVGO</strong></a></span>) is a semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions firm with a strong history. It is indeed among the group of large-cap stocks, boasting a market cap north of $250 billion. Broadcom designs, develops, and sells its software well. This is reflected in the company’s strong fundamentals and valuation metrics, which I think make it a company worthy of investment. </span>",
			"<span>Although it is currently earnings season, Broadcom actually released its <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:results;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-inc-announces-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2023-financial\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">results</a> two months ago. Earnings were strong, and the market reacted in kind, sending share prices from $598 to around $630 overnight. That would have been a better time to establish a position, but now is as good a time as any. That’s partly because the company’s share price has since sunk back down toward the $610 level, significantly below the average analyst target price above <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:$700;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AVGO/research-ratings\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$700</a>. </span>",
			"<span>In short, Broadcom grew its revenue 16% on a year-over-year basis. This enabled the company to repurchase shares and provide a decent outlook for 8% growth in Q2.  </span>",
			"<span>Broadcom is still working to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:acquire VMWare,;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.networkworld.com/article/3688515/broadcom-vmware-extend-deadline-to-complete-acquisition-by-90-days.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">acquire VMWare,</a> which is likely to spike its stock price closer to that $700 level if it goes through. </span>",

			"<span>There’s good reason to believe</span><b> Raytheon</b><span> (NYSE:<span><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:RTX;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/rtx-stock-quote/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>RTX</strong></a></span>) stock could move $10 higher toward its target price in the coming months. The defense company released Q1 results on April 25 which showed investors a strong, predictable firm with good prospects. </span>",
			"<span>Raytheon <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:reported;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investors.rtx.com/static-files/f391dc2f-926a-4d71-a85a-3630a59e89b1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> 10% overall sales growth along with 10% organic growth. So, why should RTX stock be expected to grow now? I think the answer to that question relates to a few key factors. For one, demand for its products and services is high. The company has a record $180 billion backlog and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.25. Book-to-bill is a comparison of booked orders relative to those that have been processed and are ready to bill.  </span>",
			"<span>Those figures seem to vindicate the general idea that defense spending is trending upward as geopoltical tensions rise. Raytheon reduced its dividend in 2021, but has since increased it <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:twice;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/RTX/dividend\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">twice</a>.

Currently, LIN stock yields 1.4%, and was last reduced in <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:1996;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/LIN/dividend\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1996</a>. Linde is an industrial gases firm with a global footprint and serves multiple end markets from chemicals &amp; energy, to healthcare, manufacturing and more. </span>",
			"<span>Linde’s Q1 <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:earnings;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investors.linde.com/-/media/linde/merger/documents/press-releases/2023/1q23-earnings-release-tables.pdf?la=en\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">earnings</a> report was quite satisfactory overall. Although sales were flat at $8.2 billion and up only 3% year-over-year, the period was strong overall. Operating profit increased by over 16%, reaching $2 billion. However, earnings per share was where Linde really shined. The company delivered earnings per share of $3.42, well beyond the highest end of the analyst range. In fact, it was the fourth straight quarter in which Linde’s EPS exceeded analysts’ predictions. </span>",
			"<span>Linde’s continued strong earnings performance suggests that it has strong upside potential over the long-term. </span>",
			"Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com",
			"<span>Now is the time to invest in</span><b> AbbVie</b><span> (NYSE:<span><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:ABBV;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/abbv-stock-quote/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>ABBV</strong></a></span>), even as Humira sales decline sharply. The blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug accounted for $5.587 billion of AbbVie’s $12.23 billion in sales during <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Q1;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investors.abbvie.com/news-releases/news-release-details/abbvie-reports-first-quarter-2023-financial-results\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Q1</a>. However, sales also declined sharply for the drug, falling 25.2% year-over-year.</span>",
			"<span>That led to an overall sales decline at AbbVie of 9.7%. None of this sounds particularly positive. AbbVie relies on Humira, which is losing patent protection for a large portion of its business. A predictable decline is occurring as expected. </span>",
			"<span>But there’s a caveat here. AbbVie’s sales were slightly above those expected on <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Wall Street;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/abbvie-stock-earnings-humira-sales-drop-10b6875e?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D24867010846680895882203808307966566715%7CMCORGID%3DCB68E4BA55144CAA0A4C98A5%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1682715250\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Street</a>. The earnings beat, though small, suggests AbbVie is strategically doing what it should be, in promoting the other parts of its portfolio and pushing for greater sales and market share.  </span>",
			"<span>AbbVie didn’t do worse than expected, but investors simply didn’t care to see Humira sales soften, although everyone knew they would. The markets were being irrational when they dinged ABBV stock for these results, meaning there’s an opportunity for keen investors. </span>",

			"<b>Hershey</b><span> (NYSE:<span><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:HSY;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/hsy-stock-quote/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>HSY</strong></a></span>) stock informs investors why any sort of business improvement is positive, no matter how it comes. Let me explain. </span>",
			"<span>Hershey currently expects sales to decline by 8% in 2023 after releasing Q1 <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:earnings;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.thehersheycompany.com/content/hershey-corporate/en-us/home/newsroom/press-release/press-release-detail.html?122737\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">earnings</a> on April 27. Additionally, the company expects its earnings per share to shrink by 15%. This is a case of seemingly bad news being good news. </span>",
			"<span>An 8% decline in 2023 sales is an upward adjustment to the high end of Hershey’s previous range. That is also true for its earnings per share figures. Indeed, this appears to all be a result of strong consumer demand that resulted in a revenue increase of 12.1% (12.2% organic) in Q1, with overall revenue reaching $2.898 billion. Net income also came in at $587.2 million, up 10.9%. </span>",
			"<span>These strong results are attributable to the fact that consumers remain willing to pay more for everyday items. That truth has been evident across the market as earnings continue to come in and companies continue to report the same idea that consumers are still willing to absorb higher prices. </span>",
			"Source: Alexander Yakimov / Shutterstock.com",
			"<b>Mastercard</b><span> (NYSE:<span><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:MA;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/ma-stock-quote/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>MA</strong></a></span>) is a dividend-paying stock to consider buying right now. Notably, MA stock pays a very modest 57 cent dividend that yields 0.6%. Admittedly, that isn’t a particularly compelling reason to buy. Investors don’t really buy this stock for its dividend – it’s the company’s growth profile that continues to shine. </span>",
			"<span>Indeed, </span><span>Mastercard is a smart choice right now for a different set of reasons. Consumer spending remains very strong for one. Mastercard notes as much in its earnings <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:report;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://s25.q4cdn.com/479285134/files/doc_financials/2023/q1/1Q23-Mastercard-Earnings-Release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">report</a>. Management also notes that cross-border travel continues to strengthen given the company further tailwinds. </span>",
			"<span>But at the same time, that’s all a positive spin on a bitter truth. American credit card debt is spiraling out of control. It reached <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:$986 billion;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.lendingtree.com/credit-cards/credit-card-debt-statistics/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$986 billion</a> in total in Q4, up by $61 billion in Q3. American consumer spending benefits Mastercard tremendously as balances rise. The bill is going to come due, and Mastercard will likely be one of the primary beneficiaries.</span>",

			"<b>UnitedHealth Group</b><span> (NYSE:<span><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:UNH;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/unh-stock-quote/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>UNH</strong></a></span>) continues to be a strong pick among large-cap dividend stocks. </span>",
			"<span>The insurance and healthcare provider’s better-than-expected first quarter results reaffirm that idea. The company’s earnings per share of $6.26 beat expectations by 10 cents. Likewise, the company’s medical loss ratio, at 82.2%, came in lower than expected. That means the company paid fewer medical care premiums overall, in turn contributing to stronger earnings per share figures. </span>",
			"<span>UnitedHealth Group’s dividend is rock-solid, yet modest. Currently, UNH stock yields only 1.35%, but was last reduced in 1990. Let’s run some hypothetical math here to understand the real beauty of UNH stock as an investment. Shares currently trade for $492 but have a<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:target price;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/UNH/research-ratings\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> target price</a> of $596. Assuming dividends remain the same for the next year an investor could reasonably expect their $492 to be worth $602.60 if analysts are correct ($596 + 1.65(4)). That equates to a 22.47% return. That’s an excellent return over a 12 to 18 month period. </span>",

			"Both lenders, like First Republic, lost a sizable amount of deposits during the first quarter as customers sought the perceived safety of larger banks or higher yields being offered by money market funds. PacWest, a lender based in Beverly Hills, Calif., lost 17% of its deposits and Phoenix-based Western Alliance lost 11%. First Republic lost 41%.",
			"Short sellers have increased their bets against regional bank stocks by more than $440 million over the last 30 days, according to data from S3 Partners. Since Friday, short interest in PacWest rose to more than 18% of shares, making it the second most shorted regional bank stock for the same period.",
			"\"It's definitely a sentiment trade right now,\" Alexander Yokum, an analyst with CFRA Research, told Yahoo Finance Thursday. \"And people are looking for any excuse.\"",
			"On Wednesday night and early Thursday morning, PacWest and Western Alliance both scrambled to reassure investors with new statements about their deposits. Both, in fact, used nearly the exact same language to describe how their customers reacted to this week’s First Republic announcement.",
			"PacWest said “the bank has not experienced out-of-the-ordinary deposit flows following the sale of First Republic Bank and other news” while Western Alliance said it “has not experienced unusual deposit flows” following the First Republic sale.",
			"PacWest also confirmed in its press release issued at 12:30 AM ET that it had explored asset sales and been approached recently “by several potential partners and investors.” Those discussions, it said, “are ongoing.”",
			"Both PacWest and Western Alliance are considerably smaller than First Republic, which was the nation's 14th largest bank before its failure. PacWest, founded in 1999, was the nation’s 53rd-largest bank as of Dec. 31. Western Alliance, founded in 1994, was 40th-largest as of that same period.",
			"The 38th-largest US bank, Memphis-based First Horizon (<a class=\"link\" data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\" data-ylk=\"slk:FHN;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FHN?p=FHN&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\">FHN</a>), also plummeted 33% Thursday after Toronto-Dominion Bank called off its deal to acquire the company.",
			"Western Alliance's stock took a deeper dive Thursday morning after the FT reported that the bank was considering strategic options, including a sale. It recovered some of those losses after the company issued a statement calling the story \"categorically false in all respects.\"",
			"\"Western Alliance is not exploring a sale, nor has it hired an advisor to explore strategic options,\" the company said in its statement. \"It is shameful and irresponsible that the Financial Times has allowed itself to be used as an instrument of short sellers and as a conduit for spreading false narratives about a financially sound and profitable bank.\"",
			"It was just two weeks ago that Western Alliance’s CEO, Ken Vecchione, told analysts that \"we've returned to a lot more calm\" after acknowledging his institution had lost $6 billion in deposits amid the chaos that roiled the banking world in the first quarter.",
			"He predicted deposits would grow $2 billion a quarter, guidance the bank reinforced in its statement Wednesday night, and told analysts his bank had proved it was now in a different category than First Republic.",
			"\"There was a point where whatever happened to them affected us. But I think we've now separated ourselves.\"",

			"Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said something surprising at the Milken Institute annual conference in Los Angeles on May 2, while discussing the regional banking crisis: “I think we need to raise the FDIC insurance. I’d raise it to $25 million.”",
			"In Congress, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida is teaming with Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California on legislation that would established unlimited federal insurance for many bank accounts, according to Cornell Law School Professor Robert Hockett, who’s helping draft the legislation. That follows an <a class=\"link\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" data-ylk=\"slk:FDIC report;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/options-deposit-insurance-reforms/report/options-deposit-insurance-reform-full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FDIC report</a> released May 1 that includes unlimited deposit insurance as one of three options for reforming the current system to <a class=\"link yahoo-link\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" data-ylk=\"slk:prevent the type of bank runs that have taken down three regional banks during the last six weeks and are threatening others;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regional-banks-a-focus-for-investors-as-fed-raises-rates-again-161433825.html\">prevent the type of bank runs that have taken down three regional banks during the last six weeks and are threatening others</a>.",
			"Republicans normally oppose government bailouts, and Democrats typically reject intervention that seems to favor the wealthy. But those battle lines are blurring as government and industry efforts to stanch a series of bank failures keep coming up short. Beginning with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in early March, the government has protected all deposits at failed banks, including uninsured deposits well above the $250,000 limit. That’s supposed to assure depositors all their money is safe, so they don’t withdraw money above the insured level and trigger a series of cascading bank runs.",
			"It’s not working. A short period of calm set in after Silicon Valley and Signature banks failed in March. But panic returned as First Republic began listing, resulting in a government-brokered takeover by JPMorgan Chase on May 1. Several other midsized banks are <a class=\"link yahoo-link\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" data-ylk=\"slk:now on death watch;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/plummeting-bank-stocks-test-predictions-that-worst-of-the-crisis-is-over-123744150.html\">now on death watch</a>, including PacWest and Western Alliance, as depositors flee, share prices plunge and each bad turn reinforces the other.",
			"Eleven of the biggest banks <a class=\"link\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" data-ylk=\"slk:pumped $30 billion into First Republic;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/jpmorgan-morgan-stanley-and-others-in-talks-to-bolster-first-republic-4f9eeb76\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pumped $30 billion into First Republic</a> on March 16, to demonstrate their confidence in the bank and the broader system. First Republic failed anyway. On May 1, the day First Republic failed, Citibank CEO Jane Fraser said at the Milken conference, “It’s good to have the last remaining source of uncertainty resolved today. The structure of the US financial system, it’s incredibly sound.” Markets didn’t believe Fraser. PacWest and Western Alliance shares plunged the very next day.",
			"There are two basic factors causing these failures. The first is poor management of interest-rate risk generated by the rapid rise in short-term rates as the Federal Reserve tries to get inflation under control. Bonds issued at the much lower rates of a couple years ago lose value on the secondary market as present-day rates go higher. As rates rise, banks need to adjust their portfolios to account for the falling value of older bonds. The failed banks, to varying degrees, weren’t up to the job. There’s nothing the government can do about that.",
			"The other problem is a historically high level of uninsured deposits at some of the floundering banks—and there is something the government can do about that. As banks get into trouble and start to report either real or potential losses due to interest-rate mismanagement, customers with less than $250,000 on deposit have nothing to worry about, because their money is insured, even if the bank fails. They can leave their money where it is knowing they won’t lose a penny.",
			"Deposits above $250,000 are at risk, however, and that’s the money that’s been flooding out of troubled banks. As deposits flee, banks have to sell securities to cover the withdrawals. That locks in losses on securities the banks would have been able to redeem in full if they held them to maturity. Those losses fuel concern about the bank’s solvency. More deposits flee, shareholders sell, and the death spiral is on.",
			"If deposit insurance were unlimited, there would be no uninsured depositors worried about losing their money. Banks could still mismanage risk, but there’s no reason it would trigger a run that makes the bank untenable. Most depositors would keep their money in, and troubled banks wouldn’t have to sell undervalued bonds at a loss. They might lose money and endure a stock selloff, but in theory they’d have way more breathing room to recapitalize and stay in business.",

			"The Rubio-Khanna legislation will reportedly call for unlimited deposit insurance for “transaction accounts” businesses use to pay their bills, but not for the personal accounts of wealthy individuals. “It would enable small businesses to make payroll without having to worry that only a quarter-million would be covered,” says Hockett. “Those types of accounts often have to have millions of dollars in them.”",
			"There would be drawbacks. The government funds federal deposit insurance through assessments on banks, and more insurance would require higher assessments. Banks would probably try to pass that on to consumers through higher fees or lower rates on deposits.",
			"There’s also the question of which banks would pay. There are three tiers of banks: small banks that serve local communities, bigger regional banks like those in the crosshairs now, and Goliaths such as Citi, JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. Many small-bank executives object to paying more for more insurance because they’re not the ones failing.",
			"Big banks have a similar argument—plus the lobbying power to impose their viewpoints in Washington, D.C. “I’m all for raising the level of FDIC insurance premiums, but I would not go too far with it,” Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said at the Milken conference on May 2. “There’s no reason why the banks should subsidize the ills that happen at all of the banks across the system, unconditionally.” That’s a wordy way of saying mismanaged banks, and their depositors, should bear their own losses.",
			"But there are risks of not expanding deposit insurance. Mnuchin, a Republican who served as Treasury Secretary under Donald Trump, argues that regional banks could disappear if the current crisis continues, leaving a huge funding gap for midsized businesses. “We have to fix this FDIC insurance issue because if we don’t, we’re going to end up without any regional banks. We’ll end up with community banks and big banks. I would encourage the politicians to figure this out soon.”",
			"Only Congress can raise the level of FDIC deposit insurance, and that seems unlikely for now, given that Republicans who control the House are generally opposed to the idea. But if the regional banking crisis intensifies, that could change.",
			"“Congress can act, but it is difficult to envision them acting unless we see more tangible market stress that crosses political, geographic, and ideological lines,” Isaac Boltanksy of BTIG wrote in a May 4 analysis. “While we have seen a number of high-profile bank failures, there has been a distinct sense among some in Washington that those were niche, coastal banks with limited footprints. If we see large regional banks with multi-state footprints across political geographies show signs of structural deposit flight, then lawmakers will mobilize quickly.”",

			"<span>Bitcoin was launched in 2009 and since then it has had the most volatile movements among all asset classes. If we look at Bitcoin’s price history, its shows some interesting trends. In 2010, Bitcoin was worth $0.9 and reached $26.9 in 2011. Over the years, it showed high volatility. In May 2017, Bitcoin was worth $2000 and reached over $19,000 in December of the same year.</span>",
			"<span>During these ups and downs, the brightest year for Bitcoin was noted in 2021 as we </span><a class=\"link yahoo-link\" data-ylk=\"slk:reported;elm:context_link;itc:0;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-cryptocurrency-stocks-buy-221719105.html\"><span>reported</span></a><span> previously that the cryptocurrency had reached its peak at $69,000. Later in 2022, cryptocurrency experienced one of its biggest disasters known as the “crypto winter” mainly due to the cryptocurrency exchange, FTX’s scandal, combined with Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes due to rising inflation. It was estimated that Bitcoin would close out in 2022 at $16,800. The cryptocurrency traded at even less than the estimated amount at around $16,530 on December 31, 2022.</span>",
			"<span>The FTX scandal was revealed when the digital currency news website, CoinDesk published an </span><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:article;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/02/divisions-in-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-blur-on-his-trading-titan-alamedas-balance-sheet/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span>article</span></a><span> stating that the FTX’s sister firm Alameda Research’s balance sheet was full of FTT tokens. It was later found that the capital provided by FTX to Alameda Research were customer deposits. This led Binance to sell all of its FTT tokens leading to a crash in its price which would later lead to a plethora of withdrawals from the exchange, creating a severe shortage of liquidity in the firm, thus leading to its bankruptcy.</span>",
			"<span>FTX’s CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was later arrested and his bail bond was set at $250 million which is the largest one in history. The FTX collapse spread shockwaves among the industry and shepherded two major banks toward their collapse and a third one barely getting by and is currently being investigated by the US Department of Justice for accounts connected to Bankman-Fried's businesses.</span>",
			"<span>Despite facing a rough year in 2022, Bitcoin made a major comeback as it is up by 86.86% at the time of writing from its November lows and trading at $29,444, marking its highest price since June 2022.

			"Under that plan, Buffett's eldest son Howard would become non-executive chairman, in part to preserve Berkshire's culture. Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who oversee some of Berkshire's investment portfolio, may take over all of it.",
			"INVESTMENT QUESTIONS ARE LOOMING",
			"Buffett may be asked to address recent U.S. bank seizures, Federal Reserve efforts to fend off inflation while avoiding recession, and the potential fallout if lawmakers in Washington do not raise the ceiling on how much debt the federal government can take on.",
			"Among Berkshire's largest bank and financial services investments as of Dec. 31 were Bank of America Corp, American Express Co, Citigroup Inc and Bank of New York Mellon Corp.",
			"Other questions may address Buffett's own huge investments in Apple Inc and Occidental Petroleum Corp, or his now-uncertain bet that video game maker Activision Blizzard Inc can be acquired by Microsoft Corp.",
			"While Berkshire no longer far outperforms markets over long periods as it did in Buffett's early days, in the past decade it has slightly outpaced the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 including dividends, often with less volatility.",
			"And Berkshire has kept growing, with Buffett spending $19.7 billion since October to buy the Alleghany insurance company and a larger stake in truck stop operator Pilot Travel Centers.",
			"Analysts expect Berkshire on Saturday to report more than $7 billion of first-quarter profit from its dozens of businesses including the BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance and many energy, manufacturing and retail operations.",
			"Morningstar analyst Geoffrey Warren this week lauded Berkshire's \"decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities and unmatched business strength,\" while lamenting its \"lack of engagement and opaqueness\" on governance issues.",
			"While it is unclear whether Abel could ever command the trust that investors have in Buffett, many hope he would maintain the culture that Buffett views as a key to Berkshire successes.",
			"\"It is precisely because Berkshire is decentralized and its businesses have their own CEOs that the company will do well in the post-Buffett era,\" said James Armstrong, who runs Henry H. Armstrong Associates in Pittsburgh and first invested in Berkshire 35 years ago.",
			"SIX PROPOSALS TO BE PRESENTED",
			"Still, some shareholders do want change.",
			"At the meeting, shareholders are due to present six proposals for Berkshire to address including on climate change, diversity and political advocacy, and a renewed call for Berkshire to install someone other than Buffett as chairman.",
			"Buffett opposes all six proposals.",
			"The largest U.S. public pension fund, the $455 billion California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), for a third straight year wants Berkshire to report annually on how it addresses climate change. Just over a quarter of votes in 2021 and 2022 supported the idea.",
			"\"CalPERS views climate risk as a risk to our portfolio over the long term,\" and is not singling out Berkshire, Drew Hambly, a CalPERS investment director and head of corporate governance in equities, said in an interview.",
			"Meanwhile, a proposal from Illinois state Treasurer Michael Frerichs asks Berkshire's board to disclose how the company governs climate risks, including through its audit committee.",
			"\"We believe in constructive engagement and dialogue, whether it's Warren Buffett or another company,\" Frerichs said in an interview. \"By the nature of who he is, a lot of investors would follow his lead. We would like to see him lead.\"",
			"Buffett's control of 32% of Berkshire's voting power makes passage of the proposals an uphill battle.",
			"Not all shareholders consider such proposals necessary.",
			"\"They are important issues but they are not paramount,\" Lountzis said.",

The negotiations have not been completed and defense<br/>counsel and the Government plan to continue our discussions, but do not anticipate a resolution<br/>before the deadline under the Speedy Trial Act expires on May 3, 2023.\"",
			"A possible disposition means the parties are working on a resolution, which could involve a dismissal of the charges or a plea, said one criminal attorney, who could not speak on the record. \"It's not normally a dismissal. When it's a disposition, it's usually terms and conditions of a plea, which could include negotiating a plea to a more favorable charge,\" the attorney said.",
			"Lynette Byrd, a criminal defense attorney with law firm Oberheiden, who is also a former federal prosecutor, said the Speedy Trial Act only applies to criminal, and not civil, charges. The DOJ is most likely signaling they are negotiating a plea resolution, Byrd said. “It would be very unlikely for the DOJ to voluntarily dismiss the case. That’s an extremely rare outcome. Once a person is identified as a [DOJ] target, it’s very unlikely that a person would walk away from a case by dismissing it either through a plea or otherwise,” she said.",
			"Javice’s attorneys have not held talks for a plea agreement or to settle the charges against her, a person familiar with the situation said.",
			"In September 2021, JPMorgan Chase acquired Frank, a financial aid site founded by Javice, for $175 million. The bank has since claimed that Javice lied about the number of customers Frank had at the time, and has <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:sued Javice;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2023/02/03/charlie-javice-frank-jp-morgan-lawsuit/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sued Javice</a> for securities fraud.

Federal prosecutors slapped Javice with separate counts of conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, according to the lawsuit. She was charged with one count of securities fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The Securities and Exchange Commission, in a separate lawsuit, also charged Javice with fraud for making “numerous misrepresentations” about Frank’s users.",

		"content": [
			"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.",
			"While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.",
			"Below, we take a look at <b>HSBC (HSBC)</b>, which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.",
			"It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. HSBC currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.",
			"You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;",
			"<b>Set to Beat the Market?</b>",
			"In order to see if HSBC is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this bank holds up.",
			"Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.",
			"For HSBC, shares are up 1.01% over the past week while the Zacks Banks - Foreign industry is down 0.2% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 6.83% compares favorably with the industry's 0.21% performance as well.",
			"While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of HSBC have risen 0.57%, and are up 12.47% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved -0.72% and -0.45%, respectively.",
			"Investors should also pay attention to HSBC's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. HSBC is currently averaging 1,832,530 shares for the last 20 days.",
			"<b>Earnings Outlook</b>",
			"The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with HSBC.",
			"Over the past two months, 2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost HSBC's consensus estimate, increasing from $5.78 to $6.95 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.",
			"<b>Bottom Line</b>",
			"Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that HSBC is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep HSBC on your short list.",

The company does not provide a reconciliation of its full year expected 2023 adjusted earnings or adjusted EBITDA because certain significant reconciling information is not available without unreasonable efforts.

During this call, we may make certain forward-looking statements, including statements with regard to the future performance of CODI and its subsidiaries, the impact and expected timing of acquisitions and future operational plans such as ESG initiatives. Words such as believes, expects, anticipates, plans, projects and future or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.<br/>These forward-looking statements are subject to the inherent uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions.

			"<strong>Elias Joseph Sabo</strong>",
			"Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We are pleased to report financial results that significantly exceeded our expectations. The strength and durability of our diversified group of subsidiaries was evidenced again in the first quarter as we delivered growth in both revenue and consolidated subsidiary adjusted EBITDA on a pro forma basis. This is an extraordinary accomplishment amidst the backdrop of broad and unique macroeconomic challenges. And as a result, we are raising our full year outlook for both subsidiary adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings.<br/>I think the obvious question is how are we able to achieve this. Well, it's no different than what we've said in the past, but perhaps this quarter, it's more apparent. Our strategy of assembling a highly-diversified group of companies that reach a broad set of end markets, reach a wide set of consumer demographics and have a strong underlying core growth rate drove the results we reported today. This is highly intentional and can be traced back to 2018 when we made a concerted strategic shift to transform our business towards higher-quality, higher-growth assets. I'd like to recognize our amazing group of companies and colleagues for allowing us to deliver these strong results today. <br/>But despite this, the headwinds we overcame in Q1 are still very much out there and cloud our near-term outlook. Similar to our remarks on our fourth quarter call, some of our branded consumer subsidiaries with exposure to wholesale continue to experience significant inventory destocking headwinds. As a reminder, in the first half of 2022, we benefited from extremely high demand from customers who needed our product to help manage their own supply chain issues. With the pandemic winding down and some retailers reckoning with the fact that they over-ordered, it has created a whipsaw effect until inventory is rightsized. Until this happens, our growth in these businesses will be constrained. But fortunately, it is a unique event that we expect to start correcting in the second half of the year. <br/>Take BOA, for example. This subsidiary is executing at an extremely high level and continues to take market share. Our products are on some of the strongest selling SKUs for our brand partners, and we continue to accelerate the number of new SKUs we are gaining placement on, but the current rate of destocking is so high that it's actually outpacing the market share gains we are experiencing from product sell-through and SKU count growth. This is obviously a unique phenomenon. And once we get beyond this current inventory destocking cycle, we would expect a significant snapback in revenue growth and profitability.<br/>We are also seeing the same broad trends at PrimaLoft given its similar position in the supply chain. Taking together with BOA, these represent 2 of our strongest and fastest-growing businesses. They represent our businesses with some of the best value propositions, competitive differentiation, margins and free cash flow generation. So the fact that they're getting pulled down by an unusual phenomenon, and we are still reporting consolidated growth, ties back to the incredible performance our diversified business model facilitates.<br/>Outside of these 2 subsidiaries, we delivered an astounding 15% organic growth in adjusted EBITDA. The majority of our remaining subsidiaries are performing extremely well. This gives us confidence that once the inventory destocking headwinds subside with BOA and PrimaLoft reverting back to normalized growth rates that our overall business will again show strong growth.<br/>Before turning the call over to Pat, I'd like to summarize our performance and outlook. While we had an outstanding first quarter that was stronger than anticipated, we expect the negative effects of inventory destocking and other market headwinds to suppress earnings in Q2. End demand for the majority of our goods and services remain strong. However, we experienced some moderation in end market sales as the quarter progressed, and April has continued that trend. Notwithstanding a modest slowing, the most affluent consumer continues to spend as evidenced by the incredible performance at Lugano. And as you are aware, we sell the majority of our goods at our consumer businesses to the more affluent consumer, which positions us well during this time of economic uncertainty.<br/>Notwithstanding the headwinds we expect to encounter in Q2, the strength of our subsidiaries gives us confidence we will deliver growth in the second half of 2023, leading to growth for the full year.<br/>With that, I will now turn the call over to Pat.",
			"<strong>Patrick A. Maciariello</strong>",
			"Thanks, Elias. Throughout this presentation when we discuss pro forma results, it will be as if we owned PrimaLoft from January 1, 2022. On a combined basis, revenue and EBITDA grew slightly and exceeded our expectations. As Elias discussed, the widely-reported supply chain disruptions in 2021 and 2022 created elevated inventory levels in multiple areas and, in the quarter, led to order patterns that often differed materially from end customer demand. Despite this challenging backdrop, our management teams and employees continue to perform with agility and skill.<br/>Now on to our subsidiary results. I'll begin with our niche industrial businesses. For the first quarter of 2023, revenues were approximately flat and adjusted EBITDA increased by 19% versus the first quarter of 2022. Each of our niche industrial businesses expanded margins in the quarter and, in aggregate, adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by over 250 basis points.<br/>In the first quarter, Arnold showed solid growth in revenue and EBITDA, and bookings once again exceeded shipments. Margins expanded partially due to more positive sales mix as the company continues to provide more technologically advanced solutions to their customers.<br/>Outdoor's revenue declined slightly in the quarter, as some of its more cyclical end markets faced headwinds. Adjusted EBITDA increased by almost 11%, however, as raw material prices declined and management continued to work to gain efficiencies. As a reminder, Terry Moody, Outdoor's CEO, led a planned management transition a bit less than a year ago, and we are very pleased by the early progress made by him and his team.<br/>At Sterno, demand for catering products continued to revert back to pre-pandemic levels, driving growth in the company's foodservice segment. Sterno's scented wax and oil business continued its solid performance as well, and costs at the combined business were well managed in the quarter. <br/>Turning to our consumer businesses. For the first quarter of 2023, revenues increased by 2%, and adjusted EBITDA declined by 5% as excess inventory in the supply chains at BOA, PrimaLoft and Velocity, offset strong growth at Lugano, Marucci and 5.11. Though BOA showed a decline in EBITDA versus a record Q1 2022, we remain very confident in the company's market share, SKU counts and product positioning. Put simply, in many segments, our sell-in was less than our sell-through. As we have discussed, we believe this trend will continue in the second quarter before rebounding in the back half of the calendar year. The team there continues to manage effectively, and we continue to expect full year 2023 EBITDA performance above 2021 levels.<br/>We were encouraged recently by the prelaunch of Alpine boots, incorporating, BOA's technology as well as the company's partnership with Under Armour on their new slip speed line of training shoes.<br/>Marucci had an exceptional quarter as revenue grew by 12% and EBITDA grew by over 25% when compared to the strong Q1 2022. The company benefited from exceptional sell-throughs of its CATX line of bats introduced last year and experienced strong growth in non-bat categories, including fielding gloves, bags and helmets, all showing significant growth in the quarter. Also significant air freight investments incurred in Q1 2022 to maintain and grow shelf space did not recur in Q1 2023, and the company operated efficiently.<br/>Lugano once again had a strong quarter as revenues, and adjusted EBITDA grew by 36% and 38%, respectively. The company saw strong growth in multiple salons, including Newport Beach, Palm Beach and its newly-opened Houston salon. Subsequent to quarter end, Lugano officially opened its Washington, D.C. salon, along with its exclusive Privé membership club and Newport Beach. The company is currently building out its Greenwich, Connecticut location with a target completion date in the third quarter of this year. Lugano was also targeting a second flagship location, similar to the company's Newport Beach salon, and potentially its first international salon in early 2024.<br/>Similar to Lugano, 5.11 had a strong first quarter, with revenue and adjusted EBITDA growing by 20% and 22%, respectively. Despite broad retail pressures in the U.S., the company once again benefited from strength in its diverse sales channels and end markets as professional sales, both domestically and internationally, led its growth. Additionally, the team at 5.11 did an excellent job in the quarter, operating effectively and efficiently, and we're able to gain leverage as adjusted EBITDA growth outpaced revenue growth.<br/>PrimaLoft showed a slight decline in both revenue and EBITDA as customers continue to pull down their target inventory levels. While financial performance to date has not fully met our expectations at the time of acquisition, we believe the company is taking market share. And given where it sits in the supply chain and the impact of inventory rebalancing, we believe it is outperforming its competitors. The company's project pipeline for 2024 is as broad as ever, and we remain bullish about PrimaLoft's financial prospects, following inventory stabilization in the supply chain.<br/>Touching briefly on Velocity. Point-of-sale activity has slowed following strong performance during and immediately post-pandemic. In addition, retail partners in both of the company segments have sought to further reduce inventory levels. Though it is our belief that on a sequential basis, quarterly performance will improve as we move through the year, we continue to examine additional options to rightsize parts of Velocity's cost structure to better reflect current demand patterns. As a whole, we were very pleased with the performance of our businesses in the first quarter.<br/>I will now turn the call over to Ryan for his comments on our financial results.",
			"<strong>Ryan J. Faulkingham</strong>",
			"Thank you, Pat. Moving to our consolidated financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. I will limit my comments largely to the overall results for CODI since the individual subsidiary results are detailed in our Form 10-Q that was filed with the SEC earlier today.<br/>As a reminder, our sale of Advanced Circuits occurred in the first quarter of 2023 and, therefore, was reclassified to discontinued operations in our first quarter 10-Q.<br/>Now to our quarterly consolidated results. On a consolidated basis, revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, was $542.2 million, up 6% compared to $510.5 million for the prior year period. This year-over-year increase primarily reflects our acquisition of PrimaLoft during the third quarter of 2022. Consolidated net income for the first quarter was $109.6 million compared to net income of $29.7 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the $98 million gain on the sale of Advanced Circuits in the first quarter, offset by an increase in interest expense as a result of financing the PrimaLoft acquisition and rising interest rates.<br/>Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $91.9 million, up 11% compared to $83.2 million in the first quarter of last year. The increase was due to the benefit of the PrimaLoft acquisition. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter was above our expectations at $33.2 million, down from $36 million in the prior year quarter. The decline was primarily a result of higher interest expense.<br/>Now on to our financial outlook. As a result of the strong performance in the first quarter relative to our expectations, we are increasing our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings estimates. For the full year 2023, we expect consolidated subsidiary adjusted EBITDA to range between $430 million and $460 million, an increase of $10 million at the bottom end of our initial range. For the full year 2023, we expect adjusted earnings to range between $110 million and $135 million, an increase of $5 million at the bottom end of our initial range. As Elias and Pat have covered, this outlook expects a challenging second quarter given the headwinds discussed and assumes a mid-single-digit percentage decline in adjusted EBITDA sequentially and then a reacceleration in the second half of the year.<br/>Turning to our balance sheet. As of March 31, 2023, we had approximately $53.7 million in cash, approximately $590 million available on our revolver, and our leverage was 3.87x. We have substantial liquidity. And as previously communicated, we have the ability to upsize our revolver capacity by an additional $250 million. During the quarter, we used the net proceeds from the sale of Advanced Circuits to repay our leverage -- our revolver balance, therefore, reducing our leverage levels.<br/>In addition, subsequent to quarter end, we used approximately $20 million to fund Marucci's add-on acquisition of Baum Bat. With our liquidity and capital, we stand ready and able to provide our subsidiaries with the financial support they need, invest in subsidiary growth opportunities and act on compelling acquisition opportunities as they present themselves.<br/>Turning now to cash flow provided by operations. During the first quarter of 2023, we received $15.5 million of cash flow from operations, primarily a result of strong operating performance. We used $31.5 million in working capital during the first quarter of 2023, a substantial decrease from $95.7 million in the prior year quarter when we needed to support many of our businesses' inventory levels as a result of supply chain disruptions. Lugano will continue to require working capital investments However, we expect to produce strong consolidated cash conversion in 2023 for our remaining subsidiaries in total.<br/>Also of note during the quarter, the manager waived 50% of the management fee owed by the company in respect to PrimaLoft.<br/>And finally, turning to CapEx. During the first quarter of 2023, we incurred $16.1 million of capital expenditures at our existing subsidiaries compared to $10.4 million in the prior year period. The increase was primarily a result of the timing of retail build-outs at Lugano and 5.11 to support their continued growth. For the full year of 2023, we anticipate total CapEx spend of between $60 million and $70 million. We continue to see strong returns on invested capital at several of our growth subsidiaries and believe they will have short payback periods. The 2023 capital expenditure spend will primarily be at Lugano for new retail salons and at 5.11 as we continue to increase its retail store count from its current 118 stores.<br/>With that, I will now turn the call back over to Elias.",

			"Thank you, Ryan. I'd like to close by briefly providing an update on the M&amp;A market and our strategic initiatives. In terms of M&amp;A, not much has changed since we last spoke in March. Deal activity remained suppressed well below historic levels, and we continue to believe activity in the second half of 2023 will improve as economic headwinds moderate. On the ESG front, we continue to advance our key initiatives and execute our strategy. During the quarter, we had a variety of achievements throughout our organization that I would like to highlight.<br/>Reflective of CODI's commitment to creating a positive impact for people and planet, we are thrilled to be awarded the silver badge from Catalyst 2030, an organization that partners with corporations to achieve the 2030 sustainable development goals outlined by the United Nations. We were awarded the silver badge in recognition of our work with social enterprises and the way we've actively used our purchasing power to partner with organizations with clearly defined social goals.<br/>Looking at our companies. Last month, BOA released their annual sustainability and social responsibility impact report, which outlines their future goals to significantly reduce their carbon footprint and create a more inclusive environment with equitable opportunities.<br/>Arnold Magnetic Technologies announced its partnership with Cyclic Materials, a pioneer in developing more sustainable domestic supply chains for rare earth elements. Arnold and Cyclic will work together to develop a rare earth recycling program, creating an unprecedented circular supply chain for rare earth materials.<br/>I am proud of the progress CODI and our subsidiaries have made against our ESG framework, and we look forward to continuing on this path.<br/>In conclusion, we're proud of our first quarter results, which are a testament to the successful execution of our strategy. The fact that we were able to generate organic growth in revenue and EBITDA amongst such a challenging operating environment speaks volumes to the quality of CODI's subsidiaries, the benefit of diversification amongst industries and the accelerated pace of our core growth rate.<br/>With that, operator, please open up the lines for Q&amp;A.",

			"(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Larry Solow from CGS Securities.",
			"<strong>Lawrence Scott Solow</strong>",
			"I guess just first, I guess, question on observation. So I feel like the year started off really strong, better than expected. Just trying to parse out the sort of the sequential -- a little bit of a drop mid-single digits, I guess, millions or percentage. Is it some acceleration in inventory, I guess a combination of more inventory drawdowns or more than you originally expected or longer than you originally expected into Q2 and some sort of a little bit of end market slowdown? And on the end market slowdown, are there particular businesses that are -- because it feels like most of the businesses, the larger ones are still doing strong outside inventory drawdown. So I'm just trying to get a little bit more color on where you're seeing a little bit of some extra end market slowdown.",
			"<strong>Elias Joseph Sabo</strong>",
			"Yes. Larry, it's Elias, and thank you for the question. Q1 was a really good quarter for us. I think when we sat here couple of months ago when we talked about the first quarter on our fourth quarter earnings call, we had guided that we thought we might be down kind of high single digits to low double digits. And obviously, we performed significantly better than that, really almost across the board. The business -- BOA obviously had, as you see some of the weakness that we expected from kind of this inventory destocking, which is quite severe, and I would say that's continuing. But in general, our businesses performed really well.<br/>Coming into Q2, I think we're just taking a more conservative and cautious outlook yet again in our guidance. It's weighing on us what we're hearing in terms of the macro environment out there. We're starting to see some of the data really weakening. Jolt came out down a couple -- I think it's at 2-year lows right now on kind of job openings. There's weakness in the regional banking sector. There's a bank down 40-plus percent in the aftermarket right now, and there's kind of just the continuing kind of rolling issues.<br/>So we want to be more cautious, Larry. I would say, principally what you're hearing in terms of our outlook in Q2 is more us just being cautious and conservative. There is nothing that I would say is kind of materially slower. There may be a little bit of slowdown, for example, within the 5.11 DTC business that we're seeing, but it's not so material that we would get really nervous right now. I would say our industrial portfolio, which was seeing incredible bookings growth kind of in the first quarter, has now slowed to seeing pretty good bookings growth. So I would say there are some kind of evidence of a slight slowdown in new orders that are coming in. But on the other side, we're seeing some of the inflationary pressures come off, margins improve. I think you probably saw we had a massive improvement in margins within our industrial portfolio. We would expect that to continue.<br/>So I would say that a lot of what we're forecasting here in the second quarter continues to be just an uneasiness that we all have about the macro headlines, but there is nothing right now in the business that I would say that points us to expect materially weaker results as we move forward.<br/>And with respect to some of these inventory destocking headwinds, I think they're as we anticipated, and we anticipated that they were going to go at least through to the second quarter. I think that seems to be on schedule right now. There is some, I would say, green shoots that we see here and there, where we get a good bookings week that comes along. That's probably a little bit of an improvement of where we are, and we need to start seeing that in order to then get consistently good booking weeks at BOA and PrimaLoft, which is where most of the destocking issues are hitting the hardest.<br/>So I think in general, that feels to be on where we are. And as we sit today, Larry, we have a better kind of outlook and a higher kind of level of confidence in being able to achieve the annual numbers that we set out. But we are not immune to some of the headlines that we're all hearing right now, and we'd rather just be a bit conservative.",
			"<strong>Lawrence Scott Solow</strong>",
			"Yes, that's fair. I was going to ask you a question about Lugano, but maybe just on 5.11. So I know that, obviously, the businesses did remarkably well last couple of years through COVID and then where a lot of other power businesses last few quarters have really struggled and they continued to grow. Maybe you could just give us -- you mentioned DTC, which obviously has been the big growth driver. Is that still growing just a little bit slower? Maybe give us a little update there and just on new store opening plans for 5.11.",
			"<strong>Patrick A. Maciariello</strong>",
			"Yes. So I'd say our DTC comps remain positive in Q1 of this year, and that's sort of all the color we typically give on comps, Larry. This is a Pat, by the way. But I think that's a positive sign.<br/>A lot of the strength came from our professional business. Selling into law enforcement agencies was a very good business for the company in the first quarter. And again, unlike a lot of consumer brands out there, right, this diversified strategy really provides for consistency of earnings at 5.11, and that paid off.<br/>As it relates to the new store, we have, call it, between 10 and 20 new stores planned to be opened this year, a little bit less than last year, but we are continuing to open them because the economics are just continue to be very compelling.",
			"<strong>Lawrence Scott Solow</strong>",
			"Got you. And if I could just slip one more, just on Lugano. Just obviously, the rapid growth there. I think you guys opened 2 new salons last year. Is the growth -- I feel like -- is the growth driven by the salon openings? There must be an optimal amount to, you can't just open wherever. So I am just trying to rein in and get a little more color on growth trajectory, which has been amazing going forward. I feel like it will flow. But any thoughts on that?",
			"<strong>Patrick A. Maciariello</strong>",
			"Yes. The growth is partially driven by salon openings. It's also driven by increases in sort of average order size, which continues to increase materially, right? And so those -- and new customers, and we're adding a lot of new customers. And not all of those come from salons. Some of them may come from our equestrian operations, or they may come from other relationships and other events.<br/>So I really can't -- it's not like 5.11, where you can point out our next stores times, this equals that, right? Like they -- it's a much more sort of complex picture there, so I can't give you a formula per se. But short answer is it's coming from everywhere.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kennedy from William Blair.",
			"<strong>Cristopher David Kennedy</strong>",
			"Elias, given what you just talked about on the macro side, talk about your confidence in the visibility for the snapback in the second half for BOA and PrimaLoft.",
			"<strong>Elias Joseph Sabo</strong>",
			"Yes, Chris, thanks for the question, and good afternoon. The -- I can't give you exact timing, right? And sort of Larry was kind of asking is it either deeper in terms of inventory kind of drawdown, or is it going longer, a little bit of that is going to be hard for us to tell. I think one of the things that impacted both BOA and PrimaLoft was really this kind of zero COVID policy out of China, and I know we're beyond that now. But if you just think about how many of our brand partners get a material amount of their sales in the greater China market and having kind of a number of months where Chinese consumers were on the sideline, it isn't just the product we sell to China-centric customers that then sell to the China market. It's brand partners globally that are sitting on significant inventory. Now with zero COVID being behind us, China reopening and consumption coming back, I think that's going to clear inventory and clear the way for us to be able to snap back.<br/>I can't tell you whether it's Q3, Chris, or it's Q4. I think we're getting through this inventory overhang kind of faster and on a very accelerated basis. But I feel confident in the snapback, I just don't know when the timing is going to be. And we won't -- I won't give you specific numbers on how much. But I can tell you from our analysis, we think there is a dramatically higher amount of sell-through than there is sell-in. And so at some point, unless inventory goes to 0 in the supply chain, which is obviously not possible, at some point, we have to start to match our sell-through. And just given the delta between sell-in and sell-through right now, that will provide a material jump in revenue and profitability.<br/>One, I think, that is probably far stronger than what any of us would be talking about, this isn't consistent with BOA's historical growth rate or PrimaLoft. Both of which have been north of 20% revenue growers over time. This is kind of a snapback that could be well in excess of that, given kind of the differential that exists right now between kind of sell-in and sell-through.<br/>I also would point everyone to the fact that we do measure the amount of additional SKUs that were going on, and there has been no deceleration in the amount of SKU growth that we've had at both BOA and PrimaLoft. And so we are picking up massive amounts of share, which just add to the fact that the snapback is going to be, in our opinion, really violent in a good way. And when it happens, it's going to drive significant kind of revenue and earnings growth because it will, at a minimum, start to match what sell-through is.<br/>So I can't tell you the exact timing. I wish we had a crystal ball to be able to do it. I think we're largely working through some of the inventory issues. If you go to some of the larger companies, the largest shoe wear company, footwear company in the world said they thought by the end of their kind of second quarter, which ends in May, they would largely be rightsized with inventory. I don't know that that's representative of every footwear company, but I bet you that is representative of where the industry is going.<br/>So if I had to take a guess, I think as we get through Q2, we probably start in Q3 getting some kind of orders to revert back to normal, and then I think Q4 is going to look very strong for both of those businesses. But frankly, that's more of trying to put together a mosaic from what you're hearing in the marketplace and it's not based on analytical data that we've got coming in right now.<br/>But I do think we can all anticipate the snapback is going to be very strong. And I think because this started in the fourth quarter really with PrimaLoft, we started seeing this in the third quarter of '22; in BOA, we saw it in the fourth quarter of '22, we're about ready at the back of this year to start entering some much easier comparisons. And I think as a result of that, it's going to take some of that pressure on earnings off. And even if the snapback isn't until the fourth quarter or even the first quarter, we're just not going to have these severe headwinds because the comparison gets so much easier.<br/>So we feel very good that as we get to the second half of the year, the portfolio will show and deliver growth, and that's why we're very confident that we'll get growth for the whole year. But I can't predict with any exact certainty when the snapback will be at BOA and PrimaLoft, but I think it's going to be really strong, and we're all going to feel really good when it happens.",
			"<strong>Cristopher David Kennedy</strong>",
			"No, I appreciate that. And then just a clarification on PrimaLoft not meeting your initial expectations, is that primarily related to the inventory issue? Or is there something more going on there?",
			"<strong>Patrick A. Maciariello</strong>",
			"Yes. This is Pat. Their customer acquisitions have been at or above our expectations. Their sort of new technology rollouts has been at or above our expectations. It's just, again, the existing customers and existing SKUs, the orders and the replan orders have been less than we expected due to what we perceive and what we're confident in our inventory issues in the supply chain.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from Matt Koranda from ROTH MKM.",
			"<strong>Michael David Zabran</strong>",
			"It's Mike Zabran on for Matt. Just starting with Velocity. Both top line growth and margins were under quite a bit of pressure in Q1 from the lower sell-in. But when are we expecting retailers to start stocking up for the summer quarters? What does that mean for overall seasonality throughout the year? In turn, should we expect the typical 3Q seasonality in Velocity to be less aggressive this year, given we're still seeing some caution from key retailers?",
			"<strong>Patrick A. Maciariello</strong>",
			"Yes, there's a lot there. So let me unpack it a little. I'd say we think Q2 will be better than Q1, and Q3 will be better than Q2. So let me start with that sequentially, right? Within that, we do believe we will see more sort of strength in the archery side than in the airgun side, given those dynamics you talked about around hunting and gearing up for hunting, if that makes sense. So Q1 was very weak. I would see Q1 as being a smaller percentage of the year than normal. Absent that, we don't really have too much clarity.",
			"<strong>Michael David Zabran</strong>",
			"Got it. That's helpful. Moving to working capital, specifically on inventory. How are we thinking about inventory, about how the inventory balance should move throughout the year, given the different puts and takes from store and salon build-out to 5.11 as well as further the caution we're seeing from key retailers around restocking?",
			"<strong>Ryan J. Faulkingham</strong>",
			"Yes. So I think what you guys saw is at least in the cash flow statement or use of inventory in the first quarter, and that was at really 2 businesses. That was 5.11 and Lugano, and both of that really was to support the growth we saw exiting 2022, but also the first quarter. So as we progress through the year, both inventory and working capital, we expect to come down for a majority of the businesses, the exception being Lugano, right? If we continue to see this type of growth, we will continue to support that business with inventory. Outside of them, though, we should see a significant cash conversion amongst the other 9 subsidiaries as the year progresses.",
			"<strong>Michael David Zabran</strong>",
			"Got it. That's helpful. Last one for me, guys. Just on the health care front, maybe just an update on where we stand in building out a team there. Has the appetite for a potential acquisition within 2023 changed at all? And maybe just speak to the relative size of the pipeline and how we feel about current private market valuation, specifically in health care.",
			"<strong>Elias Joseph Sabo</strong>",
			"Yes. So really no major update from where we were in the last conference call. Team remains the same led by Curt Roth and then kind of assisted by human capital that we have within the firm kind of at various levels, and that's how staffing will look until we start to kind of get a couple -- a company or 2 acquired and then we'll start building up that kind of vertical segment from a human capital standpoint.<br/>In terms of desire to do a deal, it's there. We want to be able to kind of get some health care assets invested in and kind of in-house. Unfortunately, Mike, the M&amp;A markets remain really suppressed, and it remains suppressed around kind of all categories. Sellers continue to be very cautious. I don't think what's happening in the kind of bank market helps. So when you see regional banks going out of business and their cost of capital, kind of investment-grade rated capital going into junk territory right now, that's not kind of conducive to the M&amp;A markets just broadly. So we continue to see that, I think, being a kind of a huge weight on all markets.<br/>Now all that being said, there are a couple of health care deals that have come through that have priced. I'd say broadly, the pricing has been more elevated than one would anticipate, given the massive run-up in capital costs over the course of the last year. And I would say pricing has really been more consistent with kind of where pricing was in the free money economy of '21 and prior to that than it should be in an economy that has a 5% federal funds rate right now, and I think it's indicative of the fact that there's just a lot of capital out there that is sitting on the sideline.<br/>And when you think about kind of the private markets, where we are generally competing for these assets against private equity buyers, there was just an enormous amount of capital that has been raised and continued to be raised up until kind of the last year, 1.5 years. Those funds all have relatively short-term time horizons. It's one of the things that we always point to as being a key differentiator in CODI's business model. Our competitors have to put money to work over a 5-year period. We were able to be more patient and pick and choose when we want to put money to work and not really suffer from that moral hazard of you either put it to work or you lose it, and that creates incredible divergence of interest between investors in those private equity efforts and the management teams and general partners. And luckily, our business model really eliminates that and avoids that moral hazard.<br/>Now if you think there's 5-year commitment windows in traditional private equity, we're now 1.5 years into this Fed tightening cycle and the M&amp;A markets being flat on their back. That basically ate up 1/3 of the kind of time under which P/E funds can put their money to work. It's creating -- in our opinion, that overhang will create really a level of desperation, and we're sort of seeing that when the limited number of assets come to market.<br/>So private market pricing remains elevated. We really can't find price discovery outside of health care because really not much is going on. But in the health care space, there have been a couple of deals. And I would say, if you're a seller of a health care company, now is not a bad time to go to market because that overhang is driving prices. And even though you can't get financing, I think some of the players in the market today are just assuming that financing, they can take out financing a year or 2 from now when markets become more accommodative, and these assets are being bid up at kind of prices that, in some cases, make you scratch your head.<br/>So it's not -- I think it will -- this is something we've dealt with, by the way, high pricing for the better part of the last decade. So it's not something that's unique right now. But I would say pricing continues to remain elevated for the limited number of deals that we see in market.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from Kyle Joseph from Jefferies.",
			"<strong>Kyle Joseph</strong>",
			"Just kind of a follow-up there. Obviously, you were focused on health care there. But CODI, at least in COVID, has kind of had a history of zigging when others zag. And you guys did 2 acquisitions during the pandemic, which have obviously been very fruitful, but it sounds like prices have been stubbornly high. But so just thinking about rate, leverage and market dislocation in terms of your capital allocation strategy, is now the environment where it's kind of a layer-on acquisition environment? It doesn't sound like there's a lot of platform acquisitions out there given the M&amp;A., but just kind of thinking about how you guys are thinking about capital allocation in this, given all the dislocation in the market.",
			"<strong>Elias Joseph Sabo</strong>",
			"Yes. So Kyle, I think, one, you're right. We are looking more on add-on acquisitions, and those generally tend to be much smaller. The competitiveness is typically a lot less, and pricing comes in at much better price, at much better levels. And then obviously, you have kind of either cost savings or revenue synergy opportunities that we look to extract. And kind of you can look at the most recent acquisition we made of Baum Bat into Marucci Sports. We think that's going to be a great opportunity to add that brand and a different technology, and there's some real revenue synergies that exist. So we couldn't be more thrilled to acquire a company like that. But I would anticipate we're going to see more bound-type kind of acquisitions, not from just Marucci, but in terms of add-on acquisitions that have either good cost saving or synergy opportunities within our portfolio.<br/>I think you're also right that given the dearth of new platform opportunities that are out there trading and when there is kind of 1 or 2, they seem to fetch pricing that doesn't take into account the new elevated kind of borrowing cost that we have. I think it's probably a bit more of a stretch to think that we'll do a platform, although sometimes these things can come up and we can find one. And we think there is great value, and we can move really quickly. So I don't want to rule it out, but I would just say from a probability-weighted basis, it's a bit less likely that we're going to find that.<br/>So when you think about capital allocation, I would say #1 priority within our firm is to fund the kind of high-return opportunities within our portfolio, and Lugano clearly kind of goes to the top of that list. You see that as we've been building inventory in the company, we've been generating and generated plus 30% growth rates in that company. I think there's a lot of runway to continue to invest there and have very high return on invested capital. 5.11 has been another company where by building out its store network, we've been able to get a very high return on invested capital. So that will clearly be priority #1.<br/>Priority #2 will be to acquire companies, principally add-ons because I think platforms will be a little bit harder to come by. And then our third capital allocation priority, as you know, right now, is the buyback. And although our goal is to grow, and we need capital to grow, so doing a buyback on top of returning capital through a dividend doesn't really feel like kind of consistent with our long-term growth plans. We are in a short-term period where these price levels are just extraordinarily disconnected from the reality of what our businesses are worth. And so it makes more sense for us just to continue to buy back our stock and accrete value to our shareholders.<br/>And I said this on the last conference call, and I'll reiterate it today. If someone is so short term-oriented to want to sell our stock because BOA and PrimaLoft are going through inventory destocking, then we'll happily buy it back for our shareholders who are more long-term oriented and will accrete value because there will be a big snapback in both of those businesses, and our growth rate will revert back to its historical averages.<br/>And so for us, it's going to be a sacrifice, where we're going to sacrifice using capital to potentially even stock on our balance sheet for a future acquisition or do acquisitions now because the best opportunity to accrete value for our shareholders is through execution of this buyback. And so at some point, I think maybe the stock will react and come back, and that will become less of an opportunity. But in the current environment with this current reality, that has to be a high capital allocation priority.",

			"Your next question comes from Sean-Paul Adams from Raymond James.",
			"<strong>Sean-Paul Aaron Adams</strong>",
			"It seems like you pretty much hit everything I had with BOA and PrimaLoft. Basically, if I understand you guys correctly, that you don't really know if this is going to continue past 2Q. So adjusting run rate on that might be a little bit difficult. But as far as PrimaLoft goes, have you guys seen any interest in any other regions?",
			"<strong>Patrick A. Maciariello</strong>",
			"Any other regions? Yes. I mean we sell globally, right? So our brand partners manufacture through contract manufacturers in Asia, and then they sell globally, and you'll see the PrimaLoft brand on a lot of brand -- snow gear, outerwear everywhere, right? So I think when you say other regions, we do have some projects we're specifically working on in Europe now that could be accretive. But other than that, I'm not sure. We sell globally. We ship primarily to -- or we have -- we work with our manufacturing partners in Asia who then sell to the partners of our end customers, mostly in Asia, and then those are shipped globally. Does that make sense?",
			"<strong>Sean-Paul Aaron Adams</strong>",
			"Yes. Yes, to clarify, I meant that approximately 83% of the revenue was coming from Asia Pacific so -- which is, of course, because of the textile industry. But I didn't know if you guys were getting any interest from -- sell directly to any...",
			"<strong>Patrick A. Maciariello</strong>",
			"We can't track exactly where it ends up. Does that make sense? So that's where the buyers are contracted from the brands, and there's kind of a pass-through there. So that's -- actually, you're right. That is where the revenue comes from, but that's not where the consumer buys the product, if that makes sense.",

			"Investors certainly have plenty to be fearful of as they contend with elevated market volatility, turmoil in the regional banking sector and a hawkish Federal Reserve that’s taken aggressive steps to contain inflation. So perhaps a bit of folksy wisdom from Buffett during the annual meeting Saturday will go a long way.",

Berkshire turned heads when it took a stake in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. only to slash the position by 86% the next quarter, with Buffett chalking up the decision to concerns over geopolitical tensions even as he praised the chipmaker.",

			"Succession",
			"Shareholders will have a chance to press Buffett for details on what the conglomerate will look like once he’s gone. Questions around succession planning take on new urgency with each passing year. Buffett is 92, while while his longtime investing parter and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger turned 99 in January.",
			"Abel, who’s also a vice chairman, became Buffett’s clear successor in 2021. He’s built Berkshire’s energy business into one of the largest in the US. Buffett joked during his appearance on CNBC that Abel does “all the work,” and investors will likely take the annual meeting as an opportunity to assess that comment.",
			"“Even at last year’s meeting, Greg Abel had a much more prominent role,” said Seifert, the CFRA analyst. “People are going to be looking for signs that Greg Abel is doing more of the heavy lifting.”",
			"There’s also a question as to how much, if any, screen time will go to the executives who run the various businesses under Berkshire’s umbrella. Buffett and Abel spotlighted two of those executives — BNSF CEO Katie Farmer and incoming Pilot Flying J CEO Adam Wright — during their interview with CNBC.",
			"“When I think of the talent there, it’s just amazing,” Abel said. “And their leadership skills are remarkable.”",
			"Banking",
			"Another topic Buffett might address is banks. Buffett was long a major buyer of financial stocks, becoming the largest shareholder of companies including U.S. Bancorp. But he’s been shrinking his exposure to the sector, exiting a position in Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and trimming his U.S. Bancorp stake. Berkshire remains the biggest shareholder of Bank of America Corp.",
			"Recent turmoil in which four regional US banks have collapsed since March presents an apparent opportunity for Buffett to step in and put cash to work. After Buffett held talks with Biden administration officials regarding the turmoil, no announcements were forthcoming about related investments.",
			"“I actually wasn’t expecting him to do much,” Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said in a phone interview. Berkshire’s existing exposure to the sector and recent efforts to trim it probably played a role, he said.",
			"Buffett said during his CNBC appearance that we hadn’t seen the last of bank failures, and that his enthusiasm for the sector was cooling.",
			"Inflation, Earnings",
			"Berkshire and its diverse subsidiaries function as a proxy for the state of the US economy, and Buffett has repeatedly linked the firm’s growth and his own financial success to the nation’s performance.",
			"That means Berkshire’s results have been sensitive to the inflationary pressures acting on the economy. The cost of goods for some businesses has soared and profitability of others has eroded, including Geico’s auto-insurance operations.",
			"The annual meeting this year comes a day after the latest job numbers, and Biden’s commentary on the outlook for the US economy and inflation. The Fed hinted on Wednesday that it could pause rate hikes.",
			"Investors will get a look at the latest details of Berkshire’s finances Saturday morning, when it reports results ahead of the annual meeting.",
			"“I expect some good earnings results for the first quarter,” said Shanahan of Edward Jones. “Modest” slowdowns in revenue for certain business lines will be more than offset by significant gains to net interest income on cash holdings, he said.",
			"--With assistance from Katie Greifeld.",

			"Chicago, IL – May 4, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Tri Pointe Homes, Inc. TPH as the Bull of the Day and Bassett Furniture Industries, Inc. BSET as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Morgan Stanley MS, Bank of America BAC and Citigroup Inc. C<strong>.</strong>",
			"Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.",
			"<strong>Tri Pointe Homes, Inc.</strong> is bullish about housing this spring buying season. Analysts are raising full year earnings estimates on this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).",
			"The housing bears got it wrong about the builders in 2023.",
			"Tri Pointe Homes is a large national homebuilder which builds premium homes in 10 states and the District of Columbia.",
			"On Apr 27, Tri Pointe Homes reported its first quarter results and beat again on the Zacks Consensus Estimate. It crushed it, reporting $0.73 versus the consensus of $0.42, for a 74% beat.",
			"Clearly the analysts were too pessimistic on the homebuilders to start the year.",
			"It has now beat 16 quarters in a row, with just 1 miss in the last 5 years. That miss wasn't even during the pandemic, but happened prior to it, in 2019.",
			"After a difficult fourth quarter of 2022 when new home sales were frozen as mortgage rates rose above 7%, lower mortgage rates in 2023 have allowed consumers to adjust to the new reality with rates over 6%.",
			"The buyers are back and new home orders have rebounded while cancellation rates have fallen. However, net new home orders still fell 15% from last year's strong quarter to 1619.",
			"The cancellation rate was 10%, up from 8%, but still not as bad as feared by the Street.",
			"Through targeted pricing, incentives and product repositioning, the absorption rate rose to 4.0 per community, above pre-pandemic historical seasonal levels.",
			"Tri Pointe is still seeing strong demand and believes the supply and demand dynamics are a strong tailwind for the homebuilding industry. There is a big contingent of Millennial buyers and little inventory either in new or existing homes.",
			"Tri Pointe had gross margins of 23.5% in the first quarter and still sees healthy margins between 22% and 23% in Q2.",
			"For the full year, it anticipates delivering between 4,500 and 5,000 homes at an average sales price between $690,000 and $700,000.",
			"The analysts are equally as bullish. 2 estimates were raised for the full year since the earnings report, pushing the Zacks Consensus up to $3.07 from $2.82.",
			"This is still an earnings decline of 44.6% as earnings were $5.54 last year. But 2022 was a record year that was unlikely to be repeated.",
			"1 estimate was also raised for 2024, with the Zacks Consensus rising to $3.80 from $3.76. That's earnings growth of 24%.",
			"Tri Pointe has rallied over the last 3 months, adding 24.3% during that time. It's at 5-year highs.",
			"But shares are still attractively priced with a forward P/E of 9.3 and a PEG ratio of 0.7. A PEG ratio under 1.0 indicates the company has both growth and value.",
			"Tri Pointe does not pay a dividend but it is doing a share buyback. It bought $37.6 million worth of shares in the first quarter.",
			"The momentum is with the homebuilders in 2023. Analysts and Wall Street got too bearish.",
			"Those investors interested in the homebuilders might want to keep Tri Pointe on their short list.",
			"<strong>Bassett Furniture Industries, Inc. </strong>is expected to see falling earnings this year as the pandemic-fueled furniture boom ends. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is grappling with declining sales but rising costs.",
			"Bassett Furniture makes home furnishings. It operates 92 company and licensee-owned stores in the United States. Bassett also had a traditional wholesale business with more than 700 accounts on the open market, across the United States and internationally.",
			"Additionally, it operates a logistics business specializing in home furnishings.",
			"On Mar 30, 2023, Bassett Furniture reported its fiscal first quarter results, which were those for the quarter ending Feb 25, 2023, and missed on the Zacks Consensus by $0.02. Earnings were $0.16 versus the Zacks Consensus of $0.18.",
			"It was the first earnings miss since early 2020, just before the pandemic hit.",
			"Bassett, and the furniture industry, are wrestling with \"macroeconomic inconsistencies\" even as furniture demand normalizes from the pandemic boom years. Early in the first quarter, Bassett fulfilled the remaining excess portion of the large pandemic backlog. It is now producing and shipping at a rate commensurate with its written business.",
			"While retail sales rose 1.4% year-over-year, wholesale sales fell 16% compared to the prior year, but were 7.5% ahead of the last corresponding pre-pandemic quarter.",
			"Given the slowdown, for two months, Bassett worked a reduced production schedule in its facilities. It also adjusted manufacturing employment levels by 11% this year, mostly through attrition.",
			"The supply chain turmoil is now over. As the environment has normalized, certain manufacturing cost inputs have been reduced.",
			"The company also instituted a new pricing strategy in its stores and to wholesale customers in April.",
			"It shouldn't be a surprise that furniture remains subdued. Consumers are returning to experiences, like travel, instead of spending on the home. 1 analyst cut their fiscal 2023 earnings estimate in the last 60 days. That has pushed the Zacks Consensus down to $1.20 from $2.70 that it made last year.",
			"That's a decline of 55.6%.",
			"Year-to-date Bassett Furniture shares have fallen 16.6%. Looking out over the prior 2 years, it's even worse, as the shares are down 58%.",
			"But is it a cheap stock?",
			"Bassett trades with a forward P/E of 12.2, even as earnings estimates are expected to decline. It does have a PEG ratio of just 0.8. A PEG under 1.0 usually indicates a company has both growth and value.",
			"Bassett is shareholder friendly. It pays a dividend, yielding 4.4%. It also has a share buyback program as it believes the stock is undervalued. Bassett retired $1.8 million of its stock in the quarter and continues to actively acquire shares but it has reduced its purchases given the market conditions.",
			"For those interested in the furniture industry, Bassett Furniture should be on the watch list but investors might want to wait until those earnings estimates start turning around.",
			"The continued slowdown in the investment banking (IB) business has prompted <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> to initiate another round of job cuts. The company has decided to cut 3,000 jobs in the second quarter of 2023, according to a source familiar with the matter.",
			"Amid the tough economic environment, a slowdown in deal-making has prompted MS to consider its headcount.",
			"Similar to the fourth quarter of 2022, the overall IB business performance was weak in first-quarter 2023. A host of factors, such as geopolitical tensions, inflation, rising interest rates and fears of a global recession, acted as headwinds for mergers and acquisitions.",
			"Thus, deal volume and total deal value numbers crashed in the quarter. For the same reasons, IPOs and follow-up equity issuances dried up. Bond issuance volume witnessed a decline, too, as investors turned pessimistic.",
			"Hence, Morgan Stanley’s equity underwriting fees decreased 22% from the prior-year quarter and fixed-income underwriting declined 6%. Advisory fees were down 32%. Therefore, total IB fees dipped 24% year over year.",
			"Last month, Morgan Stanley’s chief finance officer, Sharon Yeshaya, said that “expense management” was a priority, given the broader market uncertainty and elevated inflation.",
			"In December, Morgan Stanley’s CEO, James Gorman, said that the bank would make “modest” cuts worldwide, but he did not give an exact number.",
			"Over the past six months, shares of MS have gained 1.7% against the industry’s decline of 13.9%.",
			"Currently, Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).",
			"You can see <strong>the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.",
			"Similar to Morgan Stanley, Wall Street firms, including <strong>Bank of America</strong> and <strong>Citigroup Inc.</strong>, have been reducing workforce in their IB and wealth management divisions.",
			"This March, Citigroup initiated a round of job cuts, cutting hundreds of jobs across the firm, which accounted for less than 1% of its total workforce. According to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified, the company’s IB division, its operations and technology organization, and the U.S. mortgage-underwriting division were among those affected.",
			"In its investment banking division, Citigroup was struggling because of the industry-wide slowdown in deal-making. Citigroup recorded a 53% decline in IB revenues in 2022, with additional declines in the first quarter of 2023.",
			"In its mortgage division, the company was grappling with reduced mortgage demand because of rising prices and a rapid increase in mortgage rates.",
			"Likewise, in February, it was reported that Bank of America was planning to cut jobs in its investment bank. The cuts are expected to have affected less than 200 bankers globally.",
			"Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of <strong>+46.4%, +49.5%</strong> and <strong>+55.2%</strong> per year. Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.",

			"<span>There are several reasons I think <strong>Visa</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:V;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/cryptocurrency/v/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>V</strong></a>) is one of the best stocks and could be a long-term winner. The company already has a tremendous history of success and has produced exceptional results in the last five years. I believe Visa is at a stage where it can take risks and hit record revenues. The company has seen a massive <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:net income margin;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/V/visa/profit-margins\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">net income margin</a> going from 36% in 2017 to 51% in 2022. More importantly, its total payment volume went from $10.2 trillion in 2017 to $14.1 trillion in 2022. V stock is trading at $225.98 today and is up 8.97% year-to-date. </span>",

It earned $2.09 a share and hit a revenue of $7.98 billion. Visa has seen an increase in digital payments and the post-pandemic rise in travel has led to solid earnings and sales growth. Its payment volume grew 10% year-over-year and services revenue grew 7% year-over-year. Considering the volatility of banks today, consumers see Visa as a very secure alternative. It has a dividend yield of 0.80% and the current dividend is $0.40. It ended the March quarter with $13.8 billion in cash. Visa is spearheading the transition towards a cashless society. While it may take some time for many countries to go digital, there is a massive growth opportunity lying ahead. </span>",
			"<span><em>Barclay </em>analyst Ramsey El-Assal has a price target of $272 for the stock with an Overweight rating. Further, <em>Truist</em> analyst Andrew Jeffrey has also raised the price target to $270 with a buy rating after the robust Q2. Looking at the company’s fundamentals and valuation, it is ready to skyrocket in the near term. This is a world-class business you are getting at a fair valuation. </span>",

			"<span>Considering its past performance and growing market capitalization, <strong>Apple </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:AAPL;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/aapl-stock-quote/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>AAPL</strong></a>) could soon become one of the biggest <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:tech stocks;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/industries/technology/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tech stocks</a> to own.

			"<span>The company has entered the financial service segment with the new high-yield savings account in partnership with <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>. This project it has attracted <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:$1 billion;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://nypost.com/2023/05/02/apples-high-yield-savings-account-gets-1b-in-deposits/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$1 billion</a> in deposits in just 4 days. AAPL stock pays a dividend of 92 cents and has enough cash flow to continue rewarding investors. It is a cash flow machine and generates impressive free cash flow each year. The company has recently opened two <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:new stores in India;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/india-apple-stock-growth-opportunity-89f5c684\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">new stores in India</a> and is shifting its focus there due to the massive middle-class segment. India is one of the most populous nations in the world and Apple already generates $6 billion in annual revenue in the country. </span>",
			"<span>The company is expecting to grow annual sales t0 <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:$20 billion;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/apple/news/apple-will-india-be-the-next-growth-engine#:~:text=Apple%27s%20strategic%20focus%20on%20India,significant%20market%20share%20in%20smartphones.\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$20 billion</a> and grab a larger market share by 2025 in India. Additionally, its services segment has shown impressive growth potential and I believe it will rake in big numbers this quarter as well. Apple’s massive growth in the market is here to stay and the stock could hit big numbers this year. </span>",

			"<span>Electric cars are everywhere and we are constantly hearing about EV incentives. <strong>General Motors</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:GM;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/gm-stock-quote/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>GM</strong></a>) may not be an EV leader, it sure is growing on the right track. The company has the advantage of owning some of the top brands and it is aggressively charging forward in the EV space. It may not be as big as <strong>Tesla</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:TSLA;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/tsla-stock-quote/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>TSLA</strong></a>) yet but this doesn’t mean the company isn’t doing well. It is planning to transition from internal combustion engine vehicles to EVs through 2035. GM stock is trading at $32.48 today and is down 16.72% in the past six months. This is an ideal buying opportunity for one of the top soaring stocks. </span>",
			"<span>GM’s solid financials make it one of the best stocks to buy.

It aims to produce 1 million vehicles by 2025 and this number might look ambitious but the company does have a lot laid out. It has a solid balance sheet to support this goal and $24 billion in cash on hand. </span>",

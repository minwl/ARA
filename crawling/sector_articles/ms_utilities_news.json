Currently about one in four Missourians receive water service from Missouri American Water, and the company is encouraging customers to learn about the critical role system investments have in the delivery of safe and reliable water service every day.",
			"\"Our local water systems provide a resource that is critical to life, protects communities with fire protection and plays an active role in economic development,\" said Rich Svindland, president of Missouri American Water. \"It is our responsibility as the water provider for about 1.5 million people to make needed investments that will allow us to improve and maintain reliable water service for our customers today and for generations to come.\"",
			"More than $425 million in water system investments are planned statewide in 2023 in communities served by Missouri American Water. These include numerous pipe projects to replace water pipe ranging from 60-90 years old. Planned replacement of aging pipes is safer, more cost-effective and convenient for customers than emergency repairs.",

			"<strong>ST. PETERSBURG, FL / ACCESSWIRE / May 9, 2023 /</strong> Duke Energy announced the completion of two solar projects in Alachua and Suwannee counties, the latest sites in the company's community solar program portfolio, Clean Energy Connection. Together, the sites at peak production are delivering 150 megawatts of clean, renewable energy to the grid to benefit Florida customers.",
			"At peak output, each site will generate enough carbon-free electricity to power what would be equivalent to around 23,000 homes.",
			"With a combined investment of over $2 billion, Duke Energy Florida's solar generation portfolio will include 25 grid-tied solar power plants that will benefit all of the company's 1.9 million Florida customers. These projects will provide about 1,500 MW of emission-free generation using approximately 5 million solar panels by 2024.",
			"\"The company is well on its way to meeting a major milestone by placing its 21st solar project in operation by the end of this year, delivering on our customer commitment to provide reliable, affordable, clean energy,\" said Melissa Seixas, Duke Energy Florida state president. \"These investments allow Florida customers to enjoy renewable energy, while also providing cost savings by reducing fuel use.\"",
			"Based on Duke Energy Florida's current fuel mix, each 74.9-MW solar facility displaces about 1.2 million cubic feet of natural gas, 15,000 barrels of fuel oil and 12,000 tons of coal each year.",
			"<strong>Clean Energy Connection program</strong>",
			"Through the Clean Energy Connection program, Duke Energy Florida customers can subscribe to solar power and earn credits toward their electricity bills without having to install or maintain their own equipment.",
			"Customers subscribe to a portion of solar energy from the company's Clean Energy Connection solar portfolio. The monthly subscription fee will help pay for the cost of construction and operation of the renewable energy centers and is conveniently added to a customer's regular electric bill. Customers also receive a corresponding subscription credit that represents their share of the energy produced by the solar centers in a given month, multiplied by the subscription credit rate, which escalates over the life of the subscription.",
			"Enrolled income-qualified customers will receive immediate bill savings, as monthly credits will always be greater than the program fees. Current participation in any of these or related programs can be used to qualify: Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), SNAP-EBT, Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), and Duke Energy Neighborhood Energy Saver.",
			"Duke Energy Florida customers who are interested in the program can learn more through the <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Clean Energy Connection website;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://pr.report/JtYe7mqx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Clean Energy Connection website</a>.",

			"Duke Energy Florida, a subsidiary of Duke Energy, owns 10,500 megawatts of energy capacity, supplying electricity to 1.9 million residential, commercial and industrial customers across a 13,000-square-mile service area in Florida.",
			"Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK), a Fortune 150 company headquartered in Charlotte, N.C., is one of America's largest energy holding companies. Its electric utilities serve 8.2 million customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky, and collectively own 50,000 megawatts of energy capacity. Its natural gas unit serves 1.6 million customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Ohio and Kentucky. The company employs 27,600 people.",
			"Duke Energy is executing an aggressive clean energy transition to achieve its goals of net-zero methane emissions from its natural gas business by 2030 and net-zero carbon emissions from electricity generation by 2050. The company has interim carbon emission targets of at least 50% reduction from electric generation by 2030, 50% for Scope 2 and certain Scope 3 upstream and downstream emissions by 2035, and 80% from electric generation by 2040. In addition, the company is investing in major electric grid enhancements and energy storage, and exploring zero-emission power generation technologies such as hydrogen and advanced nuclear.",

			"This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -6.98%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this electric utility would post earnings of $1.06 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.11, delivering a surprise of 4.72%.",
			"Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.",
			"Duke Energy , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, posted revenues of $7.28 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.83%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $7.13 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.",

			"<b>What's Next for Duke Energy?</b>",

			"There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.",
			"Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.",
			"Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Duke Energy: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.",
			"It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.16 on $6.75 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $5.62 on $29.43 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.",
			"Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Utility - Electric Power is currently in the top 34% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.",
			"Another stock from the same industry, Algonquin Power &amp; Utilities (AQN), has yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2023. The results are expected to be released on May 11.",
			"This utility operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.15 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -28.6%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.3% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.",

			"(Bloomberg) -- NextEra Energy Partners LP jumped the most in three years as its plans to sell natural gas pipelines eased concern that the company will have to issue equity to simplify its structure.",
			"Proceeds from the sales will be used to buy out investors who had received an equity interest in a portfolio of the company’s assets in exchange for cash, according to a statement Monday. That will eliminate the need to issue equity over the next three years.",
			"NextEra Energy Partners climbed as much as 14% in New York, the most since March 2020. Before the deal was announced, shares were down almost 25% this year. Parent company NextEra Energy Inc. rose as much as 1.6%.",
			"“This transaction seems to primarily address the financing issue and the way the stock has been performing recently,” Paul Patterson, an analyst at Glenrock Associates LLC, said in a telephone interview.",
			"The plan to offload assets for cash comes as inflation roils the global economy, making it increasingly expensive to obtain debt financing. Rising rates have more companies turning to equity markets for capital, stoking investor concern that shares will be diluted.",
			"Offloading the pipelines will allow NextEra Energy Partners to focus solely on renewables as President Joe Biden’s landmark climate law boosts investment in the sector. The company, which has liquidity of $2.8 billion, is the publicly listed unit formed by NextEra Energy Inc. to buy wind, solar and other energy projects.",
			"“What we’re announcing today is the ability to access a lot of new sources of capital,” NextEra Energy Chief Executive Officer John Ketchum said on call with analysts Monday, adding that ESG funds can invest in NextEra Energy Partners now that it’s a pure-play renewables business. He also said that the move would be good for shareholders in the parent company.",
			"NextEra Energy Partners said it will sell its STX Midstream conduit in 2023 and its Meade pipeline in 2025. The company bought Meade Pipeline Co., owner of a pipeline that provides gas from Pennsylvania, in a deal valued at about $1.37 billion in 2019. STX Midstream, which owns pipeline assets in Texas, is a joint venture between NextEra Energy Partners and private equity firm EIG.",

			"“The steps announced this morning should go a long way to curtail investor concerns with an extra bonus for investors in that they are selling gas pipelines, which traditional renewable investors generally never wanted them to own,” Guggenheim Securities analysts led by Shahriar Pourreza said in a note to clients Monday morning.",

Handling more than 9 million 20-foot containers and cargo valued at $200 billion each year, port operators move about 90 million metric tons of cargo through their terminals annually. One-third of the loaded containers moving through California ports and nearly one of every five in the U.S. pass through the Port of Long Beach every year. Terminal operators at the ports are making significant advances in transitioning to all-electric power.",
			"<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:SSA Terminals;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://pr.report/3FYGxL14\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SSA Terminals</a>, which operate three berths out of a 201-acre site at the port, worked with Southern California Edison to retrofit its existing cranes to be entirely electric, converting nine 1,000-horsepower diesel engines to fully electrified versions. The cranes are used to transport imported containers, which are offloaded and stored at the terminal, to trucks that deliver them to logistical hubs or their ultimate destination.",
			"The benefits were almost immediate.",
			"\"We were burning about 10 gallons of diesel per hour, so that's our main cost savings right there,\" said Scott Hainlen, superintendent for SSA Terminals. Beyond cost benefits were those that extended to their employees. \"The operators definitely like driving these machines. They're not sitting up there next to a smokestack anymore, and they are much quieter.\"",
			"Successfully integrating the new machines into their existing operations took some firsthand experience. The new cranes initially reacted more quickly than their diesel counterparts, so SSA's crane operators made the necessary adjustments, and now they're working seamlessly. Ultimately, Hainlen said that they've seen a net increase in both efficiency and operator comfort.",
			"Hainlen expects other port operators to make the change to zero-emission machines soon as well, as the port aims to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:meet that threshold by 2030;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://pr.report/9PH6tBN7\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">meet that threshold by 2030</a>. The knowledge and experience gained through this project will extend to those operators, and SCE will play a critical role in enabling their transitions.",
			"SSA also worked with SCE to electrify 33 terminal tractors, which are used to move containers around the terminal yard.",
			"\"The Port of Long Beach is an incredible economic driver not only for our region but for California and the entire nation,\" said Michael Bushey, director of SCE's Business Customer Division. \"We take pride in our role in helping the state reach its goal of carbon neutrality by 2045, and working with the Port of Long Beach operators to reach zero emissions is a critical part of that process.\" <br/><br/>Each of those future projects will bring the port closer to its 2030 zero-emissions target, and achieving that goal will mark a significant milestone on the <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Pathway to 2045;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://pr.report/XiPMjB2c\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pathway to 2045</a>, SCE's groundbreaking analysis of the steps California must take to clean the electric grid and reach carbon neutrality.",

			"<span class=\"legendSpanClass\"><span class=\"xn-location\">OAKLAND, Calif.</span></span>, <span class=\"legendSpanClass\"><span class=\"xn-chron\">May 8, 2023</span></span> /PRNewswire/ -- With reports of scams targeting utility customers at an all-time high, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) shares tips with customers to help recognize the signs of a potential scam.",
			"A typical sign of a scam targeting a utility customer includes a caller claiming to be from PG&amp;E and threatening disconnection if immediate payment is not made via a pre-paid debit card or money transfer service like Zelle. As a reminder, PG&amp;E will never send a single notification to a customer within one hour of a service interruption, and we will never ask customers to make payments with a pre-paid debit card, gift card, any form of <span>cryptocurrency</span>, or third-party digital payment mobile applications.",
			"\"If you ever receive a call threatening utility disconnection if you do not make immediate payment, hang up the phone and either log into your account on PGE.com or call our customer service number to confirm your account details. Remember, PG&amp;E will never ask for your financial information over the phone or via email, nor will we request payment via pre-paid debit cards or other payment services like Zelle. End the call, end the scam,\" said <span class=\"xn-person\">Matt Foley</span>, lead customer scam investigator for PG&amp;E.",
			"Based on data collected so far in 2023, scammers are stepping up their efforts to defraud customers. In fact, there have been over 19,000 scam attempts reported by customers to PG&amp;E, and customers have lost nearly <span class=\"xn-money\">$342,000</span> in the first four months of 2023 alone. During 2022, PG&amp;E received nearly 23,000 reports from customers who were targeted by scammers impersonating the company, and customers lost approximately <span class=\"xn-money\">$946,000</span> in fraudulent payments.",
			"Scammers can be convincing and often target those who are most vulnerable, including senior citizens and low-income communities. They also aim their scams at small business owners during busy customer service hours. Another recent emerging scam trend involves scammers targeting real estate agents via their listings, and threatening to shut off power if immediate payment is not made. However, with the right information, customers can learn to detect and report these predatory scams.",
			"<b>Signs of a potential scam</b>",
			"<b>How customers can protect themselves</b>",
			"Customers should never purchase a prepaid card to avoid service disconnection or shutoff. PG&amp;E does not specify how customers should make a bill payment and offers a variety of ways to pay a bill, including accepting payments online, by phone, automatic bank draft, mail or in person.",
			"If a scammer threatens immediate disconnection or shutoff of service without prior notification, customers should hang up the phone, delete the email, or shut the door. Customers with delinquent accounts receive an advance disconnection notification, typically by mail and included with their regular monthly bill.",
			"Signing up for an online account at pge.com is another safeguard. Not only can customers log in to check their balance and payment history, they can also sign up for recurring payments, paperless billing and helpful alerts.",
			"Customers who suspect that they have been victims of fraud, or who feel threatened during contact with one of these scammers, should contact local law enforcement. The Federal Trade Commission's website is also a good source of information about how to protect personal information.",

			"Whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities, all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.",
			"Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.",
			"<b>Ameren in Focus</b>",
			"Ameren (AEE) is headquartered in St Louis, and is in the Utilities sector. The stock has seen a price change of 1.74% since the start of the year. The utility is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.63 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.79%. This compares to the Utility - Electric Power industry's yield of 3.24% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.74%.",
			"Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $2.52 is up 6.8% from last year. Ameren has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 6.78%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Ameren's current payout ratio is 60%, meaning it paid out 60% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.",
			"Earnings growth looks solid for AEE for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $4.35 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 5.07%.",
			"<b>Bottom Line</b>",
			"From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.",
			"High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, AEE is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).",

			"The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.",
			"Veolia Environnement SA has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while American Water Works has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that VEOEY is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.",

			"VEOEY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 8.41, while AWK has a forward P/E of 31.13. We also note that VEOEY has a PEG ratio of 0.72. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. AWK currently has a PEG ratio of 3.78.",
			"Another notable valuation metric for VEOEY is its P/B ratio of 1.32. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, AWK has a P/B of 3.03.",
			"Based on these metrics and many more, VEOEY holds a Value grade of A, while AWK has a Value grade of D.",

(<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:NYSE:D;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nyse-d/dominion-energy?blueprint=2499970&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=intro&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NYSE:D</a>) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 70% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).",
			"Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.",
			"Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Dominion Energy.",
			"<span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:View our latest analysis for Dominion Energy;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nyse-d/dominion-energy?blueprint=2499970&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Dominion Energy </a></span>",
			"Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.",
			"As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Dominion Energy. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Dominion Energy's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.",
			"Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Dominion Energy is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.0% of shares outstanding. With 7.1% and 5.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.",
			"Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.",
			"While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.",
			"The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.",
			"I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.",
			"Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Dominion Energy, Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$52m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:if those insiders have been selling.;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nyse-d/dominion-energy/ownership?blueprint=2499970&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=integrated-pitch&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">if those insiders have been selling. </a>",
			"With a 29% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Dominion Energy. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.",
			"I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

			"Stock pickers are generally looking for stocks that will outperform the broader market. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, the <strong>American Water Works Company, Inc.</strong> (<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:NYSE:AWK;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nyse-awk/american-water-works?blueprint=2499813&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=intro&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NYSE:AWK</a>) share price is up 80% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 44% (ignoring dividends).

			"There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.",
			"During five years of share price growth, American Water Works Company achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 12% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 12% per year. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.",
			"You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).",
			"It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:historic growth trends, available here.;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nyse-awk/american-water-works/past?blueprint=2499813&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=integrated-pitch&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">historic growth trends, available here.</a>.",
			"As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of American Water Works Company, it has a TSR of 94% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the <em>total</em> shareholder return.",
			"It's nice to see that American Water Works Company shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 3.2% over the last year. That's including the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 14% a year, is even better. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

			"<span class=\"legendSpanClass\"><span class=\"xn-location\">JUNO BEACH, Fla.</span></span>, <span class=\"legendSpanClass\"><span class=\"xn-chron\">May 8, 2023</span></span> /PRNewswire/ -- NextEra Energy Partners, LP (NYSE: NEP) today is announcing a plan to concentrate solely on growing its high-quality renewable energy portfolio, capitalizing on the low-cost nature of renewables and the significant capital investment needed to decarbonize the U.S. economy. To execute on this vision, NextEra Energy Partners will focus on its core strengths, eliminate a significant amount of near-term convertible equity portfolio financing obligations, reduce equity needs and simplify and recapitalize the business, all of which are intended to deliver long-term unitholder value.",
			"\"Since launching NextEra Energy Partners in 2014, we've delivered significant growth, increased our renewables portfolio by approximately nine times and have become one of the largest clean energy generators in the world,\" said <span class=\"xn-person\">John Ketchum</span>, chairman and chief executive officer of NextEra Energy Partners. \"We have a terrific track record, but we believe NextEra Energy Partners' future growth potential is not reflected in its current valuation. We believe this disconnect is driven by a combination of macroeconomic factors and concerns around the equity required to finance the partnership's convertible equity portfolio financing buyouts. Today, we are announcing plans to simplify the partnership's capital structure and singularly focus on a 100% renewable energy strategy. The U.S. economy's ongoing transition to renewable energy is a significant driver of future renewable energy investments, and we want NextEra Energy Partners to be well positioned to capitalize on these investments.",
			"\"To lead this transition, we are launching a process to sell our natural gas pipeline assets and we are suspending incentive distribution rights fees to NextEra Energy through 2026. These actions would both increase our renewable energy investments and eliminate the equity issuance that would otherwise be required to complete all three convertible equity portfolio financing buyouts planned for 2023, 2024 and 2025,\" Ketchum said. \"Under our plan, we currently do not expect any equity to be required to finance our growth plan through 2024 and do not expect any equity issuances to finance convertible equity portfolio financing buyouts through 2025. The end result of these changes is intended to create the leading 100% renewables pure-play investment opportunity for the benefit of unitholders.\"",
			"NextEra Energy Partners' plan to capitalize on the clean energy transition includes the following:",
			"Upon successfully completing the sales of the natural gas pipeline assets, NextEra Energy Partners is expected to achieve Real Zero carbon emissions in 2025 and become the leading 100% renewables pure-play investment opportunity. The partnership believes these changes could potentially invite a new class of investors looking for a carbon-free, pure-play option to participate in the energy transition.",
			"In summary, the plan would eliminate the equity buyouts of the three near-term convertible equity portfolio financings via the divestiture of the partnership's interest in natural gas pipeline assets, and the CAFD associated with the sale of the natural gas pipeline assets would be largely replaced by the IDR fees suspension. NextEra Energy Partners expects that it would have excess proceeds from the natural gas pipeline sales available to eliminate equity requirements to fund future growth through 2024.",
			"NextEra Energy Partners believes it is well positioned to execute against its plan due to its ample liquidity and significant financing capacity. The partnership had approximately <span class=\"xn-money\">$2.8 billion</span> of available liquidity as of <span class=\"xn-chron\">March 31, 2023</span>.",
			"<b>Outlook <br/></b>From a base of its fourth-quarter 2022 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of <span class=\"xn-money\">$3.25</span>, NextEra Energy Partners continues to see 12% to 15% growth per year in limited partner distributions per unit as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. Given the current capital markets environment, the partnership expects to grow distributions at or near the bottom end of this range. NextEra Energy Partners expects the annualized rate of the fourth-quarter 2023 distribution that is payable in <span class=\"xn-chron\">February 2024</span> to be in a range of <span class=\"xn-money\">$3.64</span> to <span class=\"xn-money\">$3.74</span> per common unit. NextEra Energy Partners currently has no plans to issue incremental convertible equity portfolio financings.",
			"NextEra Energy Partners' run-rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and CAFD at <span class=\"xn-chron\">Dec. 31, 2023</span>, remain unchanged. Year-end 2023 run-rate adjusted EBITDA expectations are <span class=\"xn-money\">$2.22 billion</span> to <span class=\"xn-money\">$2.42 billion</span> and CAFD of <span class=\"xn-money\">$770 million</span> to <span class=\"xn-money\">$860 million</span>, respectively, reflecting calendar-year 2024 contributions expected from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2023.",
			"The expectations discussed herein are subject to the usual caveats.",
			"This news release refers to adjusted EBITDA and CAFD expectations. NextEra Energy Partners' adjusted EBITDA expectations represent projected (a) revenue less (b) fuel expense, less (c) project operating expenses, less (d) corporate G&amp;A, plus (e) other income less (f) other deductions including IDR fees. Projected revenue as used in the calculations of projected EBITDA represents the sum of projected (a) operating revenues plus (b) a pre-tax allocation of production tax credits, plus (c) a pre-tax allocation of investment tax credits plus (d) earnings impact from convertible investment tax credits and plus (e) the reimbursement for lost revenue received pursuant to a contract with NextEra Energy Resources.",
			"CAFD is defined as cash available for distribution and represents adjusted EBITDA less (1) a pre-tax allocation of production tax credits, less (2) a pre-tax allocation of investment tax credits, less (3) earnings impact from convertible investment tax credits, less (4) debt service, less (5) maintenance capital, less (6) income tax payments less, (7) other non-cash items included in adjusted EBITDA if any. CAFD excludes changes in working capital and distributions to preferred equity investors.",
			"Adjusted EBITDA, CAFD and limited partner distributions and other expectations assume, among other things, normal weather and operating conditions; positive macroeconomic conditions in the U.S.; public policy support for wind and solar development and construction; market demand and transmission expansion support for wind and solar development; market demand for pipeline capacity; access to capital at reasonable cost and terms; and no changes to governmental policies or incentives. Please see the accompanying cautionary statements for a list of the risk factors that may affect future results. Adjusted EBITDA and CAFD do not represent substitutes for net income, as prepared in accordance with GAAP. The adjusted EBITDA and CAFD run-rate expectations have not been reconciled to expected net income because NextEra Energy Partners' net income includes unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses related to derivative transactions, which cannot be determined at this time.",

Forward-looking statements are not statements of historical facts, but instead represent the current expectations of NextEra Energy Partners, LP (together with its subsidiaries, NEP) regarding future operating results and other future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of NEP's control. Forward-looking statements in this news release include, among others, statements concerning NEP's simplification plan, long-term growth, adjusted EBITDA, cash available for distributions (CAFD) and unit distribution expectations, as well as statements concerning NEP's future operating performance, equity issuance expectations, financing needs, expected proceeds from asset sales and results of acquisitions and dispositions. In some cases, you can identify the forward-looking statements by words or phrases such as \"will,\" \"may result,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"seek,\" \"aim,\" \"potential,\" \"projection,\" \"forecast,\" \"predict,\" \"goals,\" \"target,\" \"outlook,\" \"should,\" \"would\" or similar words or expressions.

The future results of NEP and its business and financial condition are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause NEP's actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties could require NEP to limit or eliminate certain operations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: NEP's ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders is affected by the performance of its renewable energy projects which could be impacted by wind and solar conditions and in certain circumstances by market prices; operation and maintenance of renewable energy projects and pipelines involve significant risks that could result in unplanned power outages, reduced output or capacity, personal injury or loss of life; NEP's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects can be materially adversely affected by weather conditions, including, but not limited to, the impact of severe weather; NEP depends on certain of the renewable energy projects and pipelines in its portfolio for a substantial portion of its anticipated cash flows; NEP may pursue the repowering of renewable energy projects or the expansion of natural gas pipelines that would require up-front capital expenditures and could expose NEP to project development risks; geopolitical factors, terrorist acts, cyberattacks or other similar events could impact NEP's projects, pipelines or surrounding areas and adversely affect its business; The ability of NEP to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be materially adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. NEP's insurance coverage does not provide protection against all significant losses; NEP relies on interconnection, transmission and other pipeline facilities of third parties to deliver energy from its renewable energy projects and to transport natural gas to and from its pipelines. If these facilities become unavailable, NEP's projects and pipelines may not be able to operate or deliver energy or may become partially or fully unavailable to transport natural gas; NEP's business is subject to liabilities and operating restrictions arising from environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, compliance with which may require significant capital expenditures, increase NEP's cost of operations and affect or limit its business plans; NEP's renewable energy projects or pipelines may be adversely affected by legislative changes or a failure to comply with applicable energy and pipeline regulations; Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) may claim certain immunities under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and Mexican law, and the subsidiaries' of NEP that directly own the natural gas pipeline assets located in <span class=\"xn-location\">Texas</span> ability to sue or recover from Pemex for breach of contract may be limited and may be exacerbated if there is a deterioration in the economic relationship between <span class=\"xn-location\">the United States of America</span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">Mexico</span>; NEP does not own all of the land on which the projects in its portfolio are located and its use and enjoyment of the property may be adversely affected to the extent that there are any lienholders or land rights holders that have rights that are superior to NEP's rights or the U.S. Bureau of Land Management suspends its federal rights-of-way grants; NEP is subject to risks associated with litigation or administrative proceedings that could materially impact its operations, including, but not limited to, proceedings related to projects it acquires in the future; NEP's operations require NEP to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and <span class=\"xn-location\">Mexico</span>; NEP is subject to risks associated with its ownership interests in projects that are under construction, which could result in its inability to complete construction projects on time or at all, and make projects too expensive to complete or cause the return on an investment to be less than expected; NEP relies on a limited number of customers and is exposed to the risk that they may be unwilling or unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to NEP or that they otherwise terminate their agreements with NEP; NEP may not be able to extend, renew or replace expiring or terminated power purchase agreements (PPA), natural gas transportation agreements or other customer contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term basis; If the energy production by or availability of NEP's renewable energy projects is less than expected, they may not be able to satisfy minimum production or availability obligations under their PPAs; NEP's growth strategy depends on locating and acquiring interests in additional projects consistent with its business strategy at favorable prices; Reductions in demand for natural gas in <span class=\"xn-location\">the United States</span> or <span class=\"xn-location\">Mexico</span> and low market prices of natural gas could materially adversely affect NEP's pipeline operations and cash flows; government laws, regulations and policies providing incentives and subsidies for clean energy could be changed, reduced or eliminated at any time and such changes may negatively impact NEP's growth strategy; NEP's growth strategy depends on the acquisition of projects developed by NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) and third parties, which face risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, the environment, governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements; acquisitions of existing clean energy projects involve numerous risks; NEP may continue to acquire other sources of clean energy and may expand to include other types of assets. Any further acquisition of non-renewable energy projects may present unforeseen challenges and result in a competitive disadvantage relative to NEP's more-established competitors; NEP faces substantial competition primarily from regulated utility holding companies, developers, independent power producers, pension funds and private equity funds for opportunities in <span class=\"xn-location\">North America</span>; The natural gas pipeline industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect NEP's business; NEP may not be able to access sources of capital on commercially reasonable terms, which would have a material adverse effect on its ability to consummate future acquisitions and pursue other growth opportunities; restrictions in NEP and its subsidiaries' financing agreements could adversely affect NEP's business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders; NEP's cash distributions to its unitholders may be reduced as a result of restrictions on NEP's subsidiaries' cash distributions to NEP under the terms of their indebtedness or other financing agreements; NEP's subsidiaries' substantial amount of indebtedness may adversely affect NEP's ability to operate its business, and its failure to comply with the terms of its subsidiaries' indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on NEP's financial condition; NEP is exposed to risks inherent in its use of interest rate swaps; Widespread public health crises and epidemics or pandemics may have material adverse impacts on NEP's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders; NEE has influence over NEP; Under the cash sweep and credit support agreement, NEP receives credit support from NEE and its affiliates. NEP's subsidiaries may default under contracts or become subject to cash sweeps if credit support is terminated, if NEE or its affiliates fail to honor their obligations under credit support arrangements, or if NEE or another credit support provider ceases to satisfy creditworthiness requirements, and NEP will be required in certain circumstances to reimburse NEE for draws that are made on credit support; NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (NEER) and certain of its affiliates are permitted to borrow funds received by NextEra Energy Operating Partners, LP (NEP OpCo) or its subsidiaries and is obligated to return these funds only as needed to cover project costs and distributions or as demanded by NEP OpCo. NEP's financial condition and ability to make distributions to its unitholders, as well as its ability to grow distributions in the future, is highly dependent on NEER's performance of its obligations to return all or a portion of these funds; NEER's right of first refusal may adversely affect NEP's ability to consummate future sales or to obtain favorable sale terms; NextEra Energy Partners GP, Inc. (NEP GP) and its affiliates may have conflicts of interest with NEP and have limited duties to NEP and its unitholders; NEP GP and its affiliates and the directors and officers of NEP are not restricted in their ability to compete with NEP, whose business is subject to certain restrictions; NEP may only terminate the Management Services Agreement among, NEP, NextEra Energy Management Partners, LP (NEE Management), NEP OpCo and NextEra Energy Operating Partners GP, LLC  under certain limited circumstances; if the agreements with NEE Management or NEER are terminated, NEP may be unable to contract with a substitute service provider on similar terms; NEP's arrangements with NEE limit NEE's potential liability, and NEP has agreed to indemnify NEE against claims that it may face in connection with such arrangements, which may lead NEE to assume greater risks when making decisions relating to NEP than it otherwise would if acting solely for its own account; NEP's ability to make distributions to its unitholders depends on the ability of NEP OpCo to make cash distributions to its limited partners; if NEP incurs material tax liabilities, NEP's distributions to its unitholders may be reduced, without any corresponding reduction in the amount of the IDR fee; Holders of NEP's units may be subject to voting restrictions; NEP's partnership agreement replaces the fiduciary duties that NEP GP and NEP's directors and officers might have to holders of its common units with contractual standards governing their duties and the NYSE does not require a publicly traded limited partnership like NEP to comply with certain of its corporate governance requirements; NEP's partnership agreement restricts the remedies available to holders of NEP's common units for actions taken by NEP's directors or NEP GP that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duties; Certain of NEP's actions require the consent of NEP GP; Holders of NEP's common units currently cannot remove NEP GP without NEE's consent and provisions in NEP's partnership agreement may discourage or delay an acquisition of NEP that NEP unitholders may consider favorable; NEE's interest in NEP GP and the control of NEP GP may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent; Reimbursements and fees owed to NEP GP and its affiliates for services provided to NEP or on NEP's behalf will reduce cash distributions from NEP OpCo and from NEP to NEP's unitholders, and there are no limits on the amount that NEP OpCo may be required to pay; increases in interest rates could adversely impact the price of NEP's common units, NEP's ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and NEP's ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders; the liability of holders of NEP's units, which represent limited partnership interests in NEP, may not be limited if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of NEP's business; unitholders may have liability to repay distributions that were wrongfully distributed to them; the issuance of common units, or other limited partnership interests, or securities convertible into, or settleable with, common units, and any subsequent conversion or settlement, will dilute common unitholders' ownership in NEP, may decrease the amount of cash available for distribution for each common unit, will impact the relative voting strength of outstanding NEP common units and issuance of such securities, or the possibility of issuance of such securities, as well as the resale, or possible resale following conversion or settlement, may result in a decline in the market price for NEP's common units; NEP's future tax liability may be greater than expected if NEP does not generate net operating losses (NOLs) sufficient to offset taxable income or if tax authorities challenge certain of NEP's tax positions; NEP's ability to use NOLs to offset future income may be limited; NEP will not have complete control over NEP's tax decisions; and, Distributions to unitholders may be taxable as dividends. NEP discusses these and other risks and uncertainties in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended <span class=\"xn-chron\">December 31, 2022</span> and other Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, and this news release should be read in conjunction with such SEC filings made through the date of this news release.

Forward-looking statements are not statements of historical facts, but instead represent the current expectations of NextEra Energy Partners, LP (together with its subsidiaries, NEP) regarding future operating results and other future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of NEP's control. Forward-looking statements in this news release include, among others, statements concerning long-term growth, adjusted EBITDA, cash available for distributions (CAFD) and unit distribution expectations, as well as statements concerning NEP's future operating performance, financing needs and results of acquisitions.

The future results of NEP and its business and financial condition are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause NEP's actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties could require NEP to limit or eliminate certain operations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: NEP's ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders is affected by the performance of its renewable energy projects which could be impacted by wind and solar conditions and in certain circumstances by market prices; operation and maintenance of renewable energy projects and pipelines involve significant risks that could result in unplanned power outages, reduced output or capacity, personal injury or loss of life; NEP's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects can be materially adversely affected by weather conditions, including, but not limited to, the impact of severe weather; NEP depends on certain of the renewable energy projects and pipelines in its portfolio for a substantial portion of its anticipated cash flows; NEP may pursue the repowering of renewable energy projects or the expansion of natural gas pipelines that would require up-front capital expenditures and could expose NEP to project development risks; geopolitical factors, terrorist acts, cyberattacks or other similar events could impact NEP's projects, pipelines or surrounding areas and adversely affect its business; The ability of NEP to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be materially adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. NEP's insurance coverage does not provide protection against all significant losses; NEP relies on interconnection, transmission and other pipeline facilities of third parties to deliver energy from its renewable energy projects and to transport natural gas to and from its pipelines. If these facilities become unavailable, NEP's projects and pipelines may not be able to operate or deliver energy or may become partially or fully unavailable to transport natural gas; NEP's business is subject to liabilities and operating restrictions arising from environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, compliance with which may require significant capital expenditures, increase NEP's cost of operations and affect or limit its business plans; NEP's renewable energy projects or pipelines may be adversely affected by legislative changes or a failure to comply with applicable energy and pipeline regulations; Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) may claim certain immunities under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and Mexican law, and the subsidiaries' of NEP that directly own the natural gas pipeline assets located in <span class=\"xn-location\">Texas</span> ability to sue or recover from Pemex for breach of contract may be limited and may be exacerbated if there is a deterioration in the economic relationship between <span class=\"xn-location\">the United States of America</span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">Mexico</span>; NEP does not own all of the land on which the projects in its portfolio are located and its use and enjoyment of the property may be adversely affected to the extent that there are any lienholders or land rights holders that have rights that are superior to NEP's rights or the U.S. Bureau of Land Management suspends its federal rights-of-way grants; NEP is subject to risks associated with litigation or administrative proceedings that could materially impact its operations, including, but not limited to, proceedings related to projects it acquires in the future; NEP's operations require NEP to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and <span class=\"xn-location\">Mexico</span>; NEP is subject to risks associated with its ownership interests in projects that are under construction, which could result in its inability to complete construction projects on time or at all, and make projects too expensive to complete or cause the return on an investment to be less than expected; NEP relies on a limited number of customers and is exposed to the risk that they may be unwilling or unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to NEP or that they otherwise terminate their agreements with NEP; NEP may not be able to extend, renew or replace expiring or terminated power purchase agreements (PPA), natural gas transportation agreements or other customer contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term basis; If the energy production by or availability of NEP's renewable energy projects is less than expected, they may not be able to satisfy minimum production or availability obligations under their PPAs; NEP's growth strategy depends on locating and acquiring interests in additional projects consistent with its business strategy at favorable prices; Reductions in demand for natural gas in <span class=\"xn-location\">the United States</span> or <span class=\"xn-location\">Mexico</span> and low market prices of natural gas could materially adversely affect NEP's pipeline operations and cash flows; government laws, regulations and policies providing incentives and subsidies for clean energy could be changed, reduced or eliminated at any time and such changes may negatively impact NEP's growth strategy; NEP's growth strategy depends on the acquisition of projects developed by NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) and third parties, which face risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, the environment, governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements; acquisitions of existing clean energy projects involve numerous risks; NEP may continue to acquire other sources of clean energy and may expand to include other types of assets. Any further acquisition of non-renewable energy projects may present unforeseen challenges and result in a competitive disadvantage relative to NEP's more-established competitors; NEP faces substantial competition primarily from regulated utility holding companies, developers, independent power producers, pension funds and private equity funds for opportunities in <span class=\"xn-location\">North America</span>; The natural gas pipeline industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect NEP's business; NEP may not be able to access sources of capital on commercially reasonable terms, which would have a material adverse effect on its ability to consummate future acquisitions and pursue other growth opportunities; restrictions in NEP and its subsidiaries' financing agreements could adversely affect NEP's business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders; NEP's cash distributions to its unitholders may be reduced as a result of restrictions on NEP's subsidiaries' cash distributions to NEP under the terms of their indebtedness or other financing agreements; NEP's subsidiaries' substantial amount of indebtedness may adversely affect NEP's ability to operate its business, and its failure to comply with the terms of its subsidiaries' indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on NEP's financial condition; NEP is exposed to risks inherent in its use of interest rate swaps; Widespread public health crises and epidemics or pandemics may have material adverse impacts on NEP's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders; NEE has influence over NEP; Under the cash sweep and credit support agreement, NEP receives credit support from NEE and its affiliates. NEP's subsidiaries may default under contracts or become subject to cash sweeps if credit support is terminated, if NEE or its affiliates fail to honor their obligations under credit support arrangements, or if NEE or another credit support provider ceases to satisfy creditworthiness requirements, and NEP will be required in certain circumstances to reimburse NEE for draws that are made on credit support; NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (NEER) and certain of its affiliates are permitted to borrow funds received by NextEra Energy Operating Partners, LP (NEP OpCo) or its subsidiaries and is obligated to return these funds only as needed to cover project costs and distributions or as demanded by NEP OpCo. NEP's financial condition and ability to make distributions to its unitholders, as well as its ability to grow distributions in the future, is highly dependent on NEER's performance of its obligations to return all or a portion of these funds; NEER's right of first refusal may adversely affect NEP's ability to consummate future sales or to obtain favorable sale terms; NextEra Energy Partners GP, Inc. (NEP GP) and its affiliates may have conflicts of interest with NEP and have limited duties to NEP and its unitholders; NEP GP and its affiliates and the directors and officers of NEP are not restricted in their ability to compete with NEP, whose business is subject to certain restrictions; NEP may only terminate the Management Services Agreement among, NEP, NextEra Energy Management Partners, LP (NEE Management), NEP OpCo and NextEra Energy Operating Partners GP, LLC  under certain limited circumstances; if the agreements with NEE Management or NEER are terminated, NEP may be unable to contract with a substitute service provider on similar terms; NEP's arrangements with NEE limit NEE's potential liability, and NEP has agreed to indemnify NEE against claims that it may face in connection with such arrangements, which may lead NEE to assume greater risks when making decisions relating to NEP than it otherwise would if acting solely for its own account; NEP's ability to make distributions to its unitholders depends on the ability of NEP OpCo to make cash distributions to its limited partners; if NEP incurs material tax liabilities, NEP's distributions to its unitholders may be reduced, without any corresponding reduction in the amount of the IDR fee; Holders of NEP's units may be subject to voting restrictions; NEP's partnership agreement replaces the fiduciary duties that NEP GP and NEP's directors and officers might have to holders of its common units with contractual standards governing their duties and the NYSE does not require a publicly traded limited partnership like NEP to comply with certain of its corporate governance requirements; NEP's partnership agreement restricts the remedies available to holders of NEP's common units for actions taken by NEP's directors or NEP GP that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duties; Certain of NEP's actions require the consent of NEP GP; Holders of NEP's common units currently cannot remove NEP GP without NEE's consent and provisions in NEP's partnership agreement may discourage or delay an acquisition of NEP that NEP unitholders may consider favorable; NEE's interest in NEP GP and the control of NEP GP may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent; Reimbursements and fees owed to NEP GP and its affiliates for services provided to NEP or on NEP's behalf will reduce cash distributions from NEP OpCo and from NEP to NEP's unitholders, and there are no limits on the amount that NEP OpCo may be required to pay; increases in interest rates could adversely impact the price of NEP's common units, NEP's ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and NEP's ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders; the liability of holders of NEP's units, which represent limited partnership interests in NEP, may not be limited if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of NEP's business; unitholders may have liability to repay distributions that were wrongfully distributed to them; the issuance of common units, or other limited partnership interests, or securities convertible into, or settleable with, common units, and any subsequent conversion or settlement, will dilute common unitholders' ownership in NEP, may decrease the amount of cash available for distribution for each common unit, will impact the relative voting strength of outstanding NEP common units and issuance of such securities, or the possibility of issuance of such securities, as well as the resale, or possible resale following conversion or settlement, may result in a decline in the market price for NEP's common units; NEP's future tax liability may be greater than expected if NEP does not generate net operating losses (NOLs) sufficient to offset taxable income or if tax authorities challenge certain of NEP's tax positions; NEP's ability to use NOLs to offset future income may be limited; NEP will not have complete control over NEP's tax decisions; and, Distributions to unitholders may be taxable as dividends.

			"We aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. Based on the last payment, WEC Energy Group's earnings were much higher than the dividend, but it wasn't converting those earnings into cash flow. No cash flows could definitely make returning cash to shareholders difficult, or at least mean the balance sheet will come under pressure.",
			"Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 24.9% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 60% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.",
			"The company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.20, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $3.12. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 10% a year over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.",
			"The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. However, WEC Energy Group's EPS was effectively flat over the past five years, which could stop the company from paying more every year. The company has been growing at a pretty soft 1.8% per annum, and is paying out quite a lot of its earnings to shareholders. While this isn't necessarily a negative, it definitely signals that dividend growth could be constrained in the future unless earnings start to pick up again.",
			"Overall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think WEC Energy Group will make a great income stock. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.",
			"It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one.

			"Dividend aristocrats are the companies in the S&amp;P 500 that have raised their dividends for 25 years or more. Value stocks trade at a lower price relative to their intrinsic value and typically have a lower price-to-earnings ratio.

This investment strategy has proven to be successful over the long haul, delivering a total return of 1,344,600% since 1926, compared with a 626,000% return on growth stocks, as reported by <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Bank of America;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/value-vs-growth-stocks-performance/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bank of America</a>.",

			"While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational.

			"As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of FirstEnergy, it has a TSR of 42% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!",
			"While the broader market gained around 0.3% in the last year, FirstEnergy shareholders lost 3.2% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 7%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

			"<strong>Robert M. Blue</strong>",
			"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. During the first quarter, we delivered financial results consistent with our guidance range and made meaningful progress on regulated investment programs that decarbonize and add resiliency to our systems. We'll cover those topics in more detail, but let me begin with safety performance and then address the status of the business review. <br/>Our employee OSHA injury recordable rate for the first quarter was 0.21, a significant improvement relative to historical performance, including record-setting results in 2020 and 2021. We have several months left in 2023 to demonstrate our ability to drive injuries toward the only acceptable outcome, which is 0. I thank my colleagues for this remarkably strong start to the year. <br/>Now I'd like to address the business review. Our guiding commitments and priorities are unchanged and replicated identically on Slide 3. We continue to receive valuable feedback from investors, which has affirmed our focus on these principles. We'll continue to be deliberate and making ourselves available for input from the company's current and prospective capital providers. <br/>The review timeline shown on Slide 4 is also unchanged. We plan to host an Investor Day in the third quarter during which we'll provide an updated strategic and financial outlook based on the results of the business review, which is still underway. We're working expeditiously but conscientiously in recognition of the vital importance of achieving an optimal result.<br/>I'm pleased with the progress we're making towards delivering a compelling repositioning of our company to create maximum long-term value for shareholders, employees, customers and other stakeholders. We have great people and great assets, and I'm as excited as ever for the future of our company. <br/>Turning now to several noteworthy developments in Virginia, our largest service area. In November, I discussed the need to ensure that near-term economic and customer bill pressures didn't preclude the full realization of the benefits of the long-term resiliency and decarbonization capital investment opportunity before us. And in February, I discussed the need for a durable regulatory construct that provides for a competitive and fair return on utility investments to attract low-cost capital and support of our customer-focused programs. <br/>New Virginia law enacted in April and effective July 1, comprehensively addresses both of those needs. It provides significant bill relief for our customers and supports the long-term stability of our utility with nearly unanimous bipartisan support, the legislation provides the certainty we need to fund and execute critical energy investments in support of the Commonwealth's robust electric demand growth long-term energy security and reliability, leading decarbonization goals and impressive economic growth.<br/>Highlights of the law are shown on Slide 5. First, it provides meaningful rate relief for customers. Beginning July 1, it reduces the monthly bill for a typical residential customer by nearly $7 through the combination of certain existing riders that represent approximately $350 million of annual revenue, and it allows for the commission to approve the securitization of deferred fuel costs, which could provide up to $7 a month in additional near-term savings. <br/>If approved, fuel securitization would reduce the stand-alone fuel charge on customers' monthly bills by allowing the company to spread fuel cost over a multiyear period. Taken together, these savings, if approved, would equate to a 10% reduction to the current typical residential customer bill and position us to be around 21% below the national average. <br/>Second, the law simplifies the ratemaking process around our base business, which now represents about 1/3 of DEV's total rate base. Specifically the law reinstates base rate reviews on a biannual schedule as compared to the current triennial cadence, improving the timeliness of operating expense and investment recovery. <br/>It's worth noting here, no change to the use of a forward-looking mechanism for purposes of establishing base rate revenues as part of the now biennial reviews. And it retains a modified customer sharing mechanism for base rate earnings that allows both customers and shareholders to benefit from positive financial drivers like improved cost efficiency. <br/>Finally, the law prescribes certain regulatory parameters for use in rate setting for the next few years. It establishes an authorized ROE of 9.7%, up from 9.35% currently for purposes of the 2023 biennial review, which will determine base rates and rider returns through the next biennial period. <br/>It directs DEV to undertake reasonable efforts to maintain a common equity ratio of 52.1% through 2024, and it preserves the use of the rider recovery construct. As a reminder, riders are filed and trued up annually in single issue proceedings that utilize forward-looking test periods and allow for timely recovery of construction work in progress. <br/>The law complements precedent energy legislation, including the Virginia Clean Economy Act of 2020, the Grid Transformation &amp; Security Act of 2018 and the Reregulation Act of 2007 to create a regulated utility framework that has delivered exemplary reliability and resiliency as well as exceptional customer value as evidenced by customer rates that are significantly below national and regional averages as shown on Slide 6. <br/>I believe this broadly supported bipartisan legislation strikes an appropriate balance between customer benefit, regulatory oversight, and the critical need to position the company to compete for capital to support the significant investment required in Virginia for decades to come. <br/>In the words of the state's House of Delegates leadership, this resolution gives Dominion Energy Virginia, the certainty and stability to make investments needed to ensure stable, reliable service long into the future. That stability and certainty is especially critical now as we ramp into the very substantial and growing multi-decade utility investment required to address resiliency and decarbonization public policy goals plus recently updated independent electric load projections that reflect the very robust demand growth we're observing in real time across our system. <br/>I'm referring to PJM's 2023 forecast. That is shown on Slide 7, projects peak summer load growth in the DOM zone of approximately 5% per year for the next 10 years. To put that into perspective, the resulting peak load projected for 2033 has increased from 25.8 gigawatts as of the 2022 PJM estimate to 35.8 gigawatts as of this year's estimate, an increase of nearly 40%.<br/>DEV weather normal sales growth over the last 12 months was 6.1%. For full year 2023, we expect the growth rate to moderate somewhat to around 5%. So this isn't a hypothetical growth. It's demand we're seeing and investing to serve every day. <br/>On Monday, we filed an updated integrated resource plan with the Virginia Commission that outlines a variety of paths to satisfy these growing service obligations. The plan calls for an acceleration of and long-term increase in our distribution, transmission and generation investment. We look forward to engaging with all stakeholders in the planning process and we'll provide a refreshed long-term capital investment plan as part of our third quarter Investor Day. <br/>This unique intersection of industry-leading demand growth and strong policy support for resiliency, decarbonization, affordability and economic growth, combined with the durability of the Virginia regulatory construct represents an unprecedented opportunity for our company, our customers and our shareholders. <br/>It will drive growth for many years to come, require prudent capital allocation and rely on a healthy financial foundation which is one of the reasons we've repeatedly highlighted balance sheet improvement as a key priority of the business review. With that, I'll turn it over to Steven to address the financial matters before I provide additional business updates.",
			"<strong>Steven D. Ridge</strong>",
			"Thank you, Bob, and good morning. Our first quarter 2023 operating earnings, as shown on Slide 8 were $0.99 per share, which included $0.10 of hurt from worse than normal weather in our utility service areas. I'll note that this was one of the warmest first quarters on record for our electric utility service areas. <br/>Positive factors as compared to last year were normal course regulated growth, higher sales and higher Millstone margins. Other factors in addition to weather include higher interest expense, lower DEV margins for certain utility customer contracts with market-based rates, the absence of solar investment tax credits and O&amp;M timing. <br/>Normalized for the negative impact of weather, our results would have been $1.09 per share, above the midpoint of our weather normal guidance range by $0.04 as a result of a combination of several small drivers including Millstone margins, depreciation and taxes. <br/>First quarter GAAP results reflect a net income of $1.17 per share, which includes the positive noncash mark-to-market impact of economic hedging activities and unrealized gains in the value of our nuclear decommissioning trust funds. A summary of all adjustments between operating and reported results is included in Schedule 2 of the earnings release kit. <br/>Moving now to guidance on Slide 9. Given the pending business review, we are not providing full year 2023 earnings guidance. For the second quarter of 2023, we expect operating earnings to be between $0.58 and $0.68 per share. Last year's second quarter operating earnings were $0.77 and included $0.01 hurt from worse than normal weather. <br/>The second quarter 2023 guidance midpoint of $0.63 per share represents a decline of $0.14 as compared to last year but is in line with our expectations since the beginning of the year. <br/>Let me spend a minute on the key drivers for the quarter as compared to last year. Positive drivers include higher sales, lower Millstone planned outage impacts, normal weather and modest O&amp;M timing. Other drivers are primarily and as previously highlighted, higher interest rates, lower DEV margins for certain utility customer contracts with market-based rates and the lack of solar ITCs. <br/>Turning now to credit. For the avoidance of Dow, there have been no changes to our business review commitments and priorities, including with regard to credit. As we've discussed, despite meaningful qualitative improvement over the last several years, our credit metrics need strengthening. <br/>This was highlighted by S&amp;P, who recently revised its outlook from stable to negative for the Dominion family of issuers. Recall that the outlook designation typically signifies a 1/3 probability of change in rating over the next 12 to 24 months. <br/>I'd note that S&amp;P maintained its stand-alone credit profile for VEPCO at A and maintain Dominion's business risk profile as excellent, but suggested that counter measures were likely needed to strengthen the company's future credit metrics. As we've said before, we desire to emerge from the review with the ability over time to consistently meet and exceed our downgrade thresholds even during temporary periods of cost or regulatory pressure. <br/>As part of the review, we're analyzing the most efficient sources of capital to improve our balance sheet and fund our robust capital investments while seeking to minimize any amount of external equity financing need. No change on either of these 2 points from prior investor communications. <br/>Turning to Slide 10 and briefly on O&amp;M management. We know it's our responsibility to constantly look for ways to optimize the efficiency of our operations without losing sight on the absolute necessity of meeting high customer service standards. <br/>Based on the most recent data published by FERC last month, we've updated our electric O&amp;M management relative to peers. As you can see, we have a track record of operating efficiently for our customers and shareholders, which is clearly reflected, as Bob described on Slide 6 in our competitive rates as compared to national and regional averages. <br/>We've driven down costs through improved processes, innovative use of technology and other best practice initiatives. As part of the review, we are evaluating what we can additionally do on costs within the context of the significant operational and cost efficiency we achieved over the years. <br/>Before turning it back over to Bob, let me echo his enthusiasm for the future of our company. I, too, am encouraged by the progress of the review and look forward to sharing the results during our investor meeting later this year. I'll now turn the call back over to Bob.",

			"Thanks, Steven. I'll now turn to other business updates on the execution of our growth program. Turning to offshore wind on Slide 11. The project remains on track and on budget. We continue to work closely with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and other stakeholders to support the project's time line. <br/>The draft EIS received late last year was thorough and contained no surprises. Public hearings have already taken place, and we continue to work collaboratively with BOEM and all of the cooperating agencies. We expect the EIS record of decision later this year. We've advanced engineering and design work, which has allowed us to release major equipment for fabrication, and we made progress on procurement and other preconstruction activities for the onshore scope of work. <br/>Consistent with prior guidance, project costs, excluding contingency, are about 90% fixed, further derisking the project in its budget. Project to date, we've invested approximately $1.5 billion, which we expect to grow to $3.3 billion by year-end. <br/>In our most recent regulatory filing, we updated our expected LCOE to the low end of the $80 to $90 per megawatt range to account for PTC value based on the Inflation Reduction Act. In March, legislation was enacted that authorizes DEV to establish an offshore wind affiliate subject to commission approval. And for the purpose of securing a noncontrolling equity financing partner in our offshore wind project. <br/>We intend to evaluate this option as part of the business review. Our Jones Act-compliant turbine installation vessel is currently 70% complete. No change to our expectation of the completion well in advance of the need to support the current Coastal Virginia offshore wind construction schedule and timely completion by the end of 2026. <br/>On data centers, we're advancing a series of infrastructure upgrade projects that will enable incremental increases in power for data center customers in Eastern Loudoun County. The first 3 projects are ahead of schedule and will be completed by the end of this month. <br/>A second tranche of projects are on schedule to be completed by the end of 2023. Additionally, we recently received SEC approval for a new 500 kV transmission line with an expected in-service date of late 2025. This submission included around $700 million of capital investment. <br/>Turning to Slide 13. I'm very pleased that the SEC in April approved our most recent Clean Energy filing, which included nearly 800 megawatts of solar and energy storage capacity, our sixth consecutive such approval. These projects will bring jobs and economic opportunity to our communities, and they will deliver more than $250 million in fuel savings for our customers during their first 10 years in operation. <br/>Our next clean energy filing will take place later this year. Next, we're advancing our electric grid transformation plans to create a more resilient grid, improve reliability and offer faster recovery after major storms. We filed Phase III of our grid transformation plan in March, seeking approval for the continuation of existing and new projects through 2026. <br/>Our customers have already observed the benefits from prior investments as we've seen fewer outages and less significant damage on impacted facilities during major storms. The filing represented over $1 billion of rider eligible investment. We expect an order from the SEC by the end of the third quarter of 2023. <br/>Turning to South Carolina. On March 31, we filed a natural gas general rate case in South Carolina in accordance with its 2020 RSA settlement agreement with the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff. We asked in the case for an ROE of 10.38% and a revenue requirement increase of $19 million, which represents around a 6% increase to a typical residential customer bill. We expect new rates based on a typical procedural schedule to be effective in October. <br/>On April 25, the commission approved our stipulation in the electric fuel proceeding. The stipulation was prepared through the joint efforts of DESC, the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff and the South Carolina Energy Users Committee. The stipulation supports an increase of just under 4% for an average residential customer bill. We now expect to recover all previous under collections during the next fuel year. <br/>I'd note that this is the second electric fuel adjustment settlement in the past 6 months. Another example of the improved regulatory and stakeholder relationships that will benefit our customers in the state. <br/>Lastly, at our gas distribution business. The Utah system delivered 7 of the top 20 throughput days in history including the 2 highest ever during a record setting winter. Also in Utah, we've launched the next phase of our hydrogen blending pilot, and we've achieved up to 5% blending levels in Delta serving about 1,800 customers. <br/>On RNG, we have 6 RNG projects currently injecting gas with 15 projects under various stages of development. With that, let me summarize our remarks on Slide 14. <br/>Our safety performance this quarter was outstanding, but more work to do to drive injuries to 0. We delivered financial results that were within our guidance range and above the midpoint of our guidance range on a weather-normal basis. We continue to execute on our decarbonization and resiliency investment programs to meet our customers' needs while creating jobs and spurring new business growth. <br/>Our offshore wind project continues to move forward on schedule and on budget. And the top to bottom business review is proceeding with pace and purpose. I'm focused on ensuring that Dominion Energy is best positioned to create significant long-term value for our shareholders. <br/>With that, we're ready to take your questions.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) <br/>We'll take our first question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.",
			"<strong>Shahriar Pourreza</strong>",
			"Maybe just, Bob, if we could start with a kind of a sequencing question regarding the Investor Day as it kind of draws closer. Should we be expecting kind of a turnkey Investor Day reset? Or could it still be contingent on potential ongoing sale processes? And the origin of the question is that the wind stake sales seems to be taking a while right now. You have that option now. So just trying to get a feel for what level of closure you're targeting for the rollout.",
			"<strong>Robert M. Blue</strong>",
			"Yes, Shar, we're targeting, as we have said from the beginning being able to give a very good sense of the long term for our company. So no change from what we expected when we started or when we most recently updated.",
			"<strong>Shahriar Pourreza</strong>",
			"Got it. Perfect. And then Steven, you mentioned in the prepared that you continue to look at cost efficiencies, albeit within the context of all the work you've done to date. I guess how should we think about the opportunities here? Any color on scale or timing as we look ahead to the review and beyond?",
			"<strong>Steven D. Ridge</strong>",
			"Yes. Thanks, Shar. I think on the third quarter call of 2022, when we announced the business review, we did make some commentary on our focus on continuing our track record of being a very efficient operator. And I think what we said at that time, which I think was well put by Jim Chapman was that while we believe there's opportunity and we're constantly focused on looking at that. We don't view it in the -- through a lens of a game changer amount of incremental savings to what we've consistently accomplished. So as we're working through the business review, we continue to expect to find incremental efficiencies, but we've been driving a lot of those efficiencies -- inefficiencies out of the business for a number of years as reflected in our O&amp;M efficiency metrics and our rates. .",
			"<strong>Shahriar Pourreza</strong>",
			"Perfect. I think just one last one, I guess, just on the SEC. I guess what are your kind of expectations for lawmakers, I guess, to fill the 2 vacant seats at this point? It sounds like there's been little progress in Richmond. I guess what are the pathways forward here?",
			"<strong>Robert M. Blue</strong>",
			"Yes, Shar. I think it's important to start off by noting that the commission is functioning effectively as evidenced by orders just within the last few weeks that I mentioned in our opening remarks on our Clean Energy III filing, 800 megawatts of solar and storage. And on the transmission line, that's important for us to be able to serve data center customers in Northern Virginia. So the commission is functioning well in its current configuration. I can tell you that the process and the constitution of Virginia is that when there are vacancies, the general assembly can elect judges to fill commissioners to fill those vacancies. <br/>If they're not in session, the governor could make an appointment for a term that would last until 30 days after the start of the next regular session. So that's the process. But I think it's important if you sort of step back and think about the regulatory construct in Virginia. If you look just at where we sit in Virginia, we've got low rates. We've got strong reliability. We've got a clear mandate from policymakers for energy security within an energy transition and as our IRP indicates, we've got very strong load growth. So we're sitting in a very good spot moving forward in the Virginia regulatory process. So the commission is functioning now. There is a process for adding 2 new commissioners. But sort of in the big picture, we're very well positioned in Virginia for strong regulatory outcomes in the future.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And we'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.",
			"<strong>Steven Isaac Fleishman</strong>",
			"So just on the framing of the Investor Day, the -- a lot of the balance sheet fix at least seems like it could come from asset sales and the like and markets kind of keep moving around and the like. So just as we go to the Investor Day, should we assume that asset sales, if you're going to do any are actually kind of announced by then or that this process would kind of kick off by then.",
			"<strong>Steven D. Ridge</strong>",
			"Steve, this is Steve. I'll take a shot at that as well. I think as we think about the Investor Day, the goal is to have isolated as many variables of the review as possible at the time that we address the market with the repositioning of the company for the long term. And obviously, given the business review is underway, it's a little bit difficult to provide sort of more specific guidance than that. But we are well down the path on the review. As Bob mentioned, we're pleased with the progress that we're making and we look to use the Investor Day to provide a refreshed strategic and financial outlook that will cover earnings and credit and financing and capital investment. And I think based on the progress we've seen to date, we will be well positioned to do that.",
			"<strong>Steven Isaac Fleishman</strong>",
			"Okay. Makes sense. And just on the performance provision and the ROE in Virginia, can you just talk to kind of is there any clear barometer for how they're supposed to judge performance upside or downside?",
			"<strong>Robert M. Blue</strong>",
			"I think there'll need to be some work done within the commission on how that will work. It's -- there was a similar provision in the law really starting back in 2007. And -- so we see it as an opportunity to demonstrate our excellent performance when we're in front of the commission. But I think it's a little early to establish exactly how that will play out.",
			"<strong>Steven Isaac Fleishman</strong>",
			"Okay. And then lastly, just on the data centers. The -- is there any better clarity on who's really supposed to be servicing this data center load and planning for it? Like is that your obligation as part of PJM and the commission or because they have choice, is it not? Could you just give us some sense on how to think about that aspect of the low growth?",
			"<strong>Robert M. Blue</strong>",
			"We have an obligation to serve customers in Virginia. It's our obligation and we build generation, transmission and distribution as necessary to serve that load. So that's the way that it has worked. That's the way it's going to keep working in the future. So we've got investments to make as you see from the IRP.",
			"<strong>Steven Isaac Fleishman</strong>",
			"Yes. I mean even the ones that maybe if they do have on-site generation, they're typically connecting to you as well and using Dominion at least for wires and backdrop and the like. Is that correct?",
			"<strong>Robert M. Blue</strong>",
			"Absolutely. Yes. These are large loads, 24/7, they need the grid.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And we'll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.",
			"<strong>Jeremy Bryan Tonet</strong>",
			"Just wanted to touch on the IRP scenarios a bit and just see what factors are, I guess, in play between the different scenarios. Just wondering if you would note any notable highlights on resource mix considerations across these scenarios and how that would impact be?",
			"<strong>Robert M. Blue</strong>",
			"Sure. Jeremy, as you know, we laid out in the plan 5 different scenarios. Some of them required by the commission from decisions in earlier proceedings. We have plans that as they should comply with the Virginia Clean Economy Act. Others, as I noted, required by the commission that don't necessarily comply with the Clean Economy Act but the commission asked for those scenarios as well. <br/>Across all of them, what we look for is the appropriate balance between investing to serve our customers reliably and the cost of that service. And compliance with all the rules and regulations that govern us, including the Clean Economy Act. This is -- the IRP is a snapshot in time. It's what -- when we look out 15 and with certain parameters, 25 years, what we think our demand will be as projected by PJM and then the investments that we need to make in order to serve that load. <br/>This changes, as you know, over time, when we have further proceedings, it will be adjusted, I'm sure. But we, as of the time of this filing, thinks that -- believe that this document lays out a pretty clear road map for different ways that we'd be able to serve what is very robust demand growth coming over the course of the next 1.5 decade or more.",
			"<strong>Jeremy Bryan Tonet</strong>",
			"Got it. That's very helpful. And small point I just wanted to pivot for Millstone. Just wondering if there's any updated thoughts that you could provide there given, I guess, changes in the market?",
			"<strong>Robert M. Blue</strong>",
			"Yes. As we've said in prior calls, Jeremy, we think Millstone is an incredibly valuable asset to New England, both for reliability and decarbonization purposes. Our team operates that plant extraordinarily well. And as we think about the future of Millstone, we just see that it's very well positioned.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Thank you. This does conclude this morning's conference call. You may disconnect your lines, and enjoy your day."

			"Greetings, and welcome to Ameren Corporation's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.<br/>It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andrew Kirk, Director of Investor Relations for Ameren Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Kirk. You may begin.",
			"<strong>Andrew Kirk</strong>",
			"Thank you, and good morning. On the call with me today are Marty Lyons, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Moehn, our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as other members of the Ameren management team.<br/>This call contains time-sensitive data that is accurate only as of the date of today's live broadcast, and redistribution of this broadcast is prohibited.<br/>We have posted a presentation on the amereninvestors.com homepage that will be referenced by our speakers. As noted on Page 2 of the presentation, comments made during this conference call may contain statements about future expectations, plans, projections, financial performance and similar matters, which are commonly referred to as forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section in the news release we issued yesterday as well as our SEC filings for more information about the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.<br/>Now here's Marty, who will start on Page 4.",
			"<strong>Martin J. Lyons</strong>",
			"Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we discuss our first quarter 2023 earnings results.<br/>Our dedicated team continues to successfully execute on our strategic plan across all of our business segments, allowing us to consistently deliver for our customers, shareholders and the environment while laying a strong foundation for the future.<br/>And as shown on Page 5, our strategic plan integrates our strong sustainability value proposition, balancing the 4 pillars of environmental stewardship, social impact, governance and sustainable growth. These areas of focus incorporate our carbon reduction goals, which are consistent with the objective of the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Here, we also highlight a few of the many items we are doing for our customers and communities, including being an industry leader in diversity, equity and inclusion.<br/>We are honored that earlier this week, DiversityInc named Ameren to its Hall of Fame, the first utility and only 11th company to be added. DiversityInc. also recognized Ameren as a top company among all industries for ESG, supplier diversity, philanthropy and employee resource groups, or ERGs. <br/>For more than 2 decades, our team has made an explicit commitment to fostering diversity, equity and inclusion within our company and in the communities we serve. It is a value that we believe is foundational to our mission to power the quality of life. We look forward to sharing best practices with other companies as we all work together to create vibrant cultures and communities. Further, our strong corporate governance is led by a diverse Board of Directors focused on overseeing the execution of our strategic plan in a sustainable manner.<br/>Finally, this page summarizes our sustainable growth proposition, which remains among the best in the industry. <br/>As mentioned on our call in February, we have a robust pipeline of over $48 billion of investment opportunities to continue to modernize the grid and enable the transition to a cleaner energy future. Today, we published our updated sustainability investor presentation called Leading The Way to a Sustainable Energy Future. It's available at amereninvestors.com which demonstrates how we have been effectively integrating our sustainability values and practices into our corporate strategy. I encourage you to take some time to read more about our strong sustainability value proposition.<br/>Turning now to Page 6. Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2023 earnings of $1 per share compared to earnings of $0.97 per share in the first quarter of 2022. The key drivers of our first quarter results are outlined on this slide. As a result of our strong execution in the first quarter, I'm pleased to report that we remain on track to deliver within our 2023 earnings guidance range of $4.25 per share to $4.45 per share.<br/>Moving to Page 7. On our call in February, I highlighted some of the key strategic business objectives for 2023. We have been laser-focused on achieving these objectives.<br/>On Page 8, we outlined several of our key accomplishments to date. As you can see on the right side of this page, we have invested significant capital in each of our business segments during the first 3 months of this year. These investments will continue to improve reliability, resiliency, safety and efficiency of service to our customers.<br/>During the quarter, Ameren Missouri installed over 74,000 smart meters, 84 smart switches and 19 underground cable miles and energized one upgraded substation. In Illinois, our customers are benefiting from almost 1,600 new or reinforced electric poles and 36 new smart switches on electric distribution circuits as we continue to focus on replacing mechanically coupled gas service pipes. Further, our transmission business is expected to complete 40 new or upgraded transmission substations and 120 miles of new or upgraded transmission lines in the first half of the year.<br/>I'd like to express my appreciation for the Ameren team's dedication and hard work to start the year. It is worth noting that all of these system improvements were accomplished despite several major and minor storm events, including tornadoes, which our teams responded to safely and rapidly to restore service to impacted customers. I am pleased to say that 97% of customers that lost power as a result of these storms saw service restored within 24 hours. Thank you again for your dedication to our customers and communities. <br/>Moving on to regulatory matters. We are pleased with the constructive settlement of the Ameren Missouri Electric rate review in April. The stipulation and agreement calls for a $140 million annual revenue increase and is subject to Missouri Public Service Commission approval. If approved, residential customer rates will have increased approximately 2% compounded annually since April 1, 2017, prior to Ameren Missouri opting into plant and service accounting. This constructive regulatory framework, which is effective through at least 2028, continues to allow Ameren Missouri to make meaningful infrastructure investments, providing significant benefits to customers. These investments have contributed to a 12% improvement in reliability for Ameren Missouri customers since 2017.<br/>We've achieved additional constructive regulatory outcomes this year in Missouri and Illinois related to our clean energy transition, which I'll touch on more in a moment.<br/>Moving on to operational matters. To ensure strong operational performance over the coming summer months, last week, we initiated a planned maintenance outage on the generator at the Callaway Energy Center. We expect the energy center to be back online next week.<br/>Finally, we remain focused on keeping customer bills as low as possible through disciplined cost management, continuous improvement and optimizing our operating performance as we transform our business through investment to ensure we sustainably provide safe, reliable, resilient and cleaner energy for our customers. <br/>Moving to Page 9. As we've discussed in the past, MISO completed a study outlining a potential road map of transmission projects through 2039. Detail project planning, design work and procurement for the $1.8 billion of Tranche 1 projects assigned to Ameren is underway. MISO's request for proposal on the remaining $700 million of competitive projects in Missouri and Illinois have begun to be issued, and we are in the process of preparing our proposals. We expect to submit our first bid relating to the Orient - Denny - Fairport line later this month.<br/>The proposal and evaluation process for the 3 competitive projects is expected to take place over the course of 2023 and into mid-2024. <br/>Looking ahead to Tranche 2, MISO's analysis of potential projects is well underway and will continue for the remainder of the year and into early next year. MISO anticipates the tranche 2 portfolios of projects will be approved in the first half of 2024.<br/>Moving now to Page 10. In February and April, the Missouri PSC approved certificates of convenience and necessity, or CCNs, for 2 Ameren Missouri's solar projects, the Huck Finn Solar Project located in Missouri and the Boomtown Solar Project in Illinois.<br/>The Huck Finn project, which will support compliance with the Missouri Renewable Energy Standard, will be our largest solar project to date. Construction of this facility is expected to create approximately 250 jobs. And once in operation, it will produce enough energy to power approximately 40,000 homes.<br/>In addition, in April, the Missouri PSC approved Ameren Missouri's Renewable Solutions Program, which will be supported by the 150-megawatt Boomtown project. This subscription-based program is available to midsized and large commercial and industrial customers and municipalities across Missouri. Participating organizations can enroll for up to 100% of their future energy needs to meet their own renewable goals. 10 organizations are the initial participants in this innovative program, which is fully subscribed.<br/>Further, I'm excited to say Ameren Missouri has entered into an engineering, supply and construction agreement to construct the 50-megawatt Vandalia Solar Project located in Central Missouri. This project represents the first larger-scale renewable energy center that will be fully developed and built by Ameren Missouri. We expect to file for a CCN for this project with the Missouri PSC midyear. <br/>We expect to announce additional solar energy projects in the next few months. These renewable projects are consistent with Ameren Missouri's Integrated Resource Plan, which includes a thoughtful and measured approach to transition our generation portfolio.<br/>Turning to Page 11. I will cover progress being made in both Illinois and Missouri to provide incentive-supporting investment infrastructure that will enable advancement of electric vehicles, or EVs, across our service territory and in our region. We continue to see electric vehicle adoption advanced in our region and expect further growth as a result of our EV programs in both states in addition to increased state and federal funding. <br/>In March, the ICC approved Ameren Illinois' beneficial electrification program, which expands on its existing electric vehicle charging program and provides at least $27 million through 2025 for programs, incentives and rates, encouraging EV adoption and infrastructure development with a focus on equity and low-income customers. Through this plan, we will also support the governor's goal of having 1 million electric vehicles on the road in Illinois by 2030. <br/>In Missouri, the PSC approved our Charge Ahead Program in 2020 and extended it in 2022. This $11 million program aims to eliminate barriers and incentivize electric vehicle adoption. This includes the addition of approximately 1,800 public workplaces and multi-dwelling charging ports by 2024. Along the Missouri highway corridors, 14 fast-charging stations are already in operation as part of this program. <br/>In addition, we are participating in and supporting the Edison Electric Institute's National Corridor Charging initiative. We believe strong adoption of electric vehicles will provide benefits for our customers, including lower rates due to load growth and, importantly, advance the clean energy transition.<br/>Moving to Page 12. Looking ahead over the next decade, we have a robust pipeline of investment opportunities of $48 billion that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. Of course, our investments also create thousands of jobs for our local economies. Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure and a transition to a cleaner future in a responsible fashion will be critical to meeting our country's energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations.<br/>Turning to Page 13. In February, we updated our 5-year growth plan, which included our expectation of a 6% to 8% compound annual earnings growth rate from 2023 through 2027. This earnings growth is primarily driven by strong compound annual rate base growth of 8.4%, supported by strategic allocation of infrastructure investment to each of our operating segments based on their constructive regulatory frameworks. Combined, we expect to deliver strong long-term earnings and dividend growth, resulting in an attractive total return that compares favorably with our regulated utility peers.<br/>I am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done. Again, thank you all for joining us today. I will now turn the call over to Michael.",
			"<strong>Michael L. Moehn</strong>",
			"Thanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 15 of our presentation. Yesterday we reported first quarter 2023 earnings of $1 per share compared to $0.97 per share for the year ago quarter. This page summarizes key drivers impacting earnings at each segment. As you can see, under our constructive regulatory frameworks, we experienced earnings growth in Ameren Transmission, Illinois Electric Distribution and Illinois Natural Gas, driven by increased infrastructure investment.<br/>While Ameren Missouri's earnings declined driven by the warmest combined January and February in 50 years, we were able to deliver strong earnings performance during the quarter as a result of our diverse business mix and disciplined cost management.<br/>Moving to Page 16. Despite experiencing one of the warmest winters in 50 years, we're off to a strong start. We continue to expect 2023 earnings to be in the range of $4.25 to $4.45 per share. The $0.05 earnings per share impact due to mild first quarter temperatures is expected to be offset through disciplined cost management.<br/>On this page, we've highlighted select considerations impacting our 2023 earnings guidance for the remainder of the year. These are supplemental to the key drivers and assumptions discussed in our earnings call in February. I encourage you to take these into consideration as you develop your expectations for quarterly earnings results for the remainder of the year.<br/>Turning now to Page 17 for details on the Ameren Missouri electric rate review. In April, a non-unanimous stipulation agreement was reached in our Ameren Missouri electric rate review for $140 million annual revenue increase. The stipulation agreement was a black box settlement and did not specify certain details, including return on equity, capital structure or rate base. The agreement did provide for the continuation of key trackers and riders, including the fuel adjustment clause. Pending Missouri PSC approval, new Ameren Missouri electric service rates are expected to be effective by July 1.<br/>Moving to Page 18. In January, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution filed its first multiyear rate plan, or MYRP with the ICC. The MYRP includes a grid monetization plan that lays out our electric distribution investment and supports our annual revenue increase request for the next 4 years. Our request for $171 million rate increase in 2024 is based on an average rate base of $4.3 billion, a return on equity of 10.5% and an equity ratio of 54%. Our filing includes the phase-in provision and proposal for 50% of the requested 2024 rate increase to be collected from customers in 2026. We expect staff and intervening testimony next Thursday, May 11 and an ICC decision by December with rates effective January 2024. You can find additional key components of our MYRP following on this slide.<br/>Turning to Page 19 and other Illinois regulatory matters. In April, we filed our electric distribution annual rate reconciliation, requesting an additional $127 million to reconcile the 2022 revenue requirements to the actual cost. An ICC decision is required by December, and the full amount would be collected from customers in 2024. <br/>In January, we filed our Ameren Illinois Natural Gas rate review requesting a $160 million increase based on a 10.7% ROE, a 54% equity ratio and a $2.9 billion rate base. We expect staff and intervenor testimony today and an ICC decision by late November, with rates effective in early December.<br/>On Page 20, we provide a financing update. We continue to feel very good about our financial position. On March 13, Ameren Missouri issued $500 million of 5.45% first mortgage bonds due 2053. Proceeds of the offering were used to fund capital expenditures and refinance short-term debt.<br/>Further, in order for us to maintain our credit ratings and a strong balance sheet while we fund our robust infrastructure plan, we expect to issue approximately $300 million of common equity, consisting of approximately 3.2 million shares by the end of this year. These shares were previously sold forward under our ATM equity program.<br/>Additionally, we have begun to enter into forward sales agreements in support of our 2024 equity needs. Together with the issuance of our 401(k) and our DRPlus programs. Our ATM equity program is expected to support our equity needs in 2024 and beyond.<br/>Finally, turning to Page 21. We're well-positioned to continue executing our plan. We're off to a strong start, and we expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2023 as we continue to successfully execute our strategy.<br/>As we look to the longer term, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our peers. Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story. <br/>That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.",
			"<strong>Robin Lamar Shillock</strong>",
			"This is Robin Shillock on for Jeremy. With one week left in the Missouri legislative session, any updates on the right of first refusal legislation that you've been supporting? And additionally, has this or any other recent Missouri legislative developments influenced your outlook for MISO or transmission opportunities in the state?",
			"<strong>Martin J. Lyons</strong>",
			"Yes. Look, you're right, we've got just a little bit of time left, the legislative session. This is Marty Lyons, by the way, ends on May 12 at 6:00 p.m.. And we have been supportive of right of first refusal legislation that's been moving along in the legislature. And so you've probably been following House Bill 992 and Senate Bill 568, and we certainly support the legislative efforts there. Both bills have been heard in committees, and we'll see whether there's any action on those bills as we approach the end of the session.<br/>So we, again, continue to believe that right of first refusal legislation is a positive. It certainly would allow transmission infrastructure to be built more rapidly in our state and at a cost competitive level. So we're very supportive of that. We'll see whether it gets through. It's hard to predict any piece of legislation, whether it will go through, given the various priorities the legislature has.<br/>But in terms of the latter part of your question, whether that's influencing our thoughts on any of our path forward, I would say, no. As we look ahead, we continue to invest in a reliable clean energy transition, meaning both reliable energy delivery infrastructure, renewable energy as well as transmission. So we'll continue to pursue those things. We do think things like right of first refusal are important to make sure that, that infrastructure build-out can happen efficiently and effectively and maintain a good reliable system. But we'll keep forging forward, so thanks for your question.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) Mr. Lyons, there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.",
			"<strong>Martin J. Lyons</strong>",
			"Okay. Well, thank you all for joining us today. As you heard in our prepared remarks, we've had a strong start to 2023, and we remain focused on continuing to deliver for the remainder of the year. So we invite you to join our annual shareholder meeting, which is coming up here on May 11, and we look forward to seeing many of you at the AGA Financial Forum in a couple of weeks.<br/>With that, thank you, and everybody, have a great day.",

			"\"We're seeing significant business and industrial growth across our region over the next several years, which reflects the many competitive advantages of the Gulf region, recent geopolitical dynamics and supportive commodity trends,\" said Marsh. \"We also see an unprecedented growth opportunity in helping our customers achieve their own emission reduction goals, which begins with us reducing our customers' indirect emissions and continues through electrification of industrial operations to reduce their direct emissions. This unique growth opportunity is starting to materialize now and will drive Entergy's growth in the years and decades to come.\"",
			"To help foster industrial customers' continued investment in the Entergy region and ensure prosperity for its customers and communities, the company continues to engage with its regulators and other key stakeholders to accelerate investments in resilience and strengthened infrastructure.",
			"\"These investments will reduce future storm restoration costs, help our customers and communities recover faster, and give our customers the confidence to make investments that help our communities thrive,\" he said.",
			"Marsh cited several milestones Entergy achieved in 2022:",
			"<b>Focused on the customer, leading on electrification</b>",
			"In 2022, Entergy actively worked to keep energy rates affordable for customers and communities.",
			"Higher than usual temperatures last summer drove record energy usage, and this combined with higher natural gas prices and storm recovery costs produced higher electric bills. To help ease the burden, we worked closely with our regulators on a series of measures including applying shareholder donations to all Entergy operating companies for bill payment assistance programs. Those donations and our ongoing The Power to Care program accounted for <span class=\"xn-money\">$10 million</span> in customer assistance.",
			"We set up flexible payment arrangements and waived late payment fees for eligible residential customers. In addition to these direct financial actions, our employees conducted volunteer energy efficiency and weatherization events in several neighborhoods.",
			"In partnership with nonprofit organizations, we've been working on additional ways to help customers who are facing ongoing challenges receive financial assistance from federal and state programs. In 2022, those initiatives translated into 41% more financial assistance received by our customers compared with the previous year.",
			"We will continue making investments to reduce fuels costs through more efficient generation and renewable resources. By expanding our clean energy capacity, we will reduce our customers' indirect emissions and continue through electrification of industrial operations to reduce their direct emissions.",
			"\"I am excited about Entergy's future. Our employees have proven they are highly motivated to help power the lives of our stakeholders today, tomorrow and for future generations. They have demonstrated they are working for everyone and ready for anything. That is what our communities and customers expect from us, and that is what it takes to be the premier utility,\" said Marsh.",
			"\"Fundamentally, we believe all our stakeholders have a very bright future ahead, and Entergy is championing a better electric future through lower carbon generation, reliable transmission and expanded customer use,\" Marsh concluded.",
			"<b>Other business</b>",

			"<strong>Operator:</strong> Good morning. My name is Audra, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PG&amp;E Corporation First Quarter 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jonathan Arnold, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.",
			"<strong>Jonathan Arnold :</strong> Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for PG&amp;E's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With us today are Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer; Chris Foster, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Carolyn Burke, our Executive Vice President of Finance, who will step into the CFO role later today. We also have other members of the leadership team here with us in our Oakland headquarters. First, I should remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results. These statements are based on information currently available to management. Some of the important factors, which could affect our actual financial results, are described on the second page of today's first quarter earnings call presentation.",
			"The presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures. The slides, along with other relevant information, can be found online at investor.pgecorp.com. We would also encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, which was released earlier today. And with that, it's my pleasure to hand the call over to our CEO, Patti Poppe.",
			"<strong>Patricia Poppe :</strong> Thank you, Jonathan, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by noting that this will be Chris Foster's last earnings call with PG&amp;E. Thank you, Chris, for your commitment and service to our company over the past 11 years. Since we announced our CFO transition in March, Chris has worked tirelessly to ensure an orderly transition to Carolyn Burke, who will formally take over as our CFO later today. So thank you, Chris, for your friendship, your leadership and your dedication to serving our customers and investors. And a formal welcome to Carolyn, who brings a wealth of financial experience to PG&amp;E as we continue on our journey remaking the company as a top-performing regulated utility. You'll all have opportunities to get to know Carolyn at upcoming events, including at our Investor Day in California later this month.",
			"We know you have a lot of calls occurring today. And since we've had a strong quarter, and we'll be seeing many of you in just a couple of weeks, we'll be crisp and to the point. Let's get started. Turning to our results on Slide 3. You'll see we reported first quarter 2023 non-GAAP core earnings of $0.29 per share. This result keeps us on track with our plan for the year. One timing item to consider is our 2023 general rate case. As is common with California GRCs, we have a memo account in place, which will allow for new rates to be implemented retroactive to January 1, meaning that after the final decision is reached, we'd expect to begin recognizing the GRC outcome along with the prior quarter's catch-up. The case schedule calls for a proposed decision in the second quarter and a final decision in the third quarter.",
			"We continue to communicate with all stakeholders to how important it is to have a timely decision in order to have the resources we need to deliver for our customers. Also today, we reaffirm our full year 2023 core EPS guidance of $1.19 to $1.23, which at the midpoint represents an increase of 10% over 2022. We also reaffirm our previously stated longer-term targets of at least 10% core EPS growth in 2024 and at least 9% for 2025 and 2026. Also unchanged is our plan for no new equity issuance through 2024. As we've said before, we'll work to manage the business through ups and downs like weather, regulatory timing, interest rates and inflation, while delivering the safety and reliability investments that our customers need and the consistent financial results our investors expect.",
			"Here on Slide 4, I'll review some of the highlights and proof points as we continue to make progress on mitigating risk, both physical and financial. On wildfire risk mitigation, we filed our 2023 Wildfire Mitigation Plan at the end of March, which further builds on the layers of protection approach from our 2022 plan. Record winter rains and snowfall have left our hydro assets in a stronger position than they've been in for some years. CEMA, our Catastrophic Event Memorandum Account is one of the constructive features of the California regulatory model. It enables us to focus on serving customers when they need us the most, while we track and defer for future recovery much of the costs associated with these historic weather events. We recorded several hundred million dollars of repair and restoration work to the CEMA account between December and March.",
			"Meanwhile, our customer restoration efforts and storm response have been well received in our communities, and our performance benefited from the investments we have made in technology, situational awareness and emergency response coordination. We've also continued to see more constructive policy outcomes, building on last year's passage of legislation supporting our establishment of a 10-year undergrounding plan as well as the state's decision to extend the life of the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant. Highlights in the first quarter include our wildfire self-insurance plan, which enjoyed unusually strong support from interveners. We were also pleased to receive the Nuclear Regulatory Commission waiver, allowing our two Diablo Canyon nuclear units to continue operating beyond their current license expiration date, while the NRC is considering the renewal applications.",
			"Rawpixel.com/Shutterstock.com",
			"We expect to file our applications with the NRC by year-end. And most recently, in the past week, we were encouraged by the proposed decision issued in our 2022 WMCE proceeding. This would grant our full request for $1.1 billion of interim rate relief while allowing for collection over 12 months, also as requested. The PD could be voted out by the CPUC as soon as the June 8 meeting, and we will be advocating for a timely adoption so that customer benefits can be realized. These benefits include millions of dollars in customer financing savings as well as providing cash funding to accelerate investment. This will facilitate us delivering needed safety, reliability and customer connections work. I'm also happy to report on continued progress mitigating financial risk.",
			"Our simple, affordable model and deployment of waste elimination, the fifth play of our lean operating system, enables improving the customer experience while keeping us on track to deliver our 2% annual O&amp;M savings in spite of weather and inflation. Also, in support of customer affordability, we worked with the state to offset commodity price increases on winter bills with an acceleration of the annual California Climate Credit. Overall, during the winter gas commodity price run-ups, our procurement team was able to save customers over $1 billion through a series of thoughtful measures including a diversified portfolio that includes interstate pipeline capacity reaching back to the supply basins, natural gas storage and financial hedging. Turning to Slide 5.",
			"We continue to estimate that our layers of protection have mitigated over 90% of wildfire risk through the combination of inspection, physical hardening, our Enhanced Powerline Safety Settings, Public Safety Power Shutoffs and improved situational awareness and response. While 2022 did not bring the typical high-wind events that would trigger PSPS, we did see an increase of over 30% in high fire risk base given the significant drought conditions. Despite this increased risk, our EPSS program resulted in a reduction of 69% in CPUC reportable admissions, along with 99% fewer acres impacted for EPSS-enabled mines versus the pre-EPSS baseline or 2018 to 2020 average. Our 2023 wildfire mitigation plan builds on these core elements and will also see us deploy additional operational mitigations such as partial voltage detection, which leverages our existing smart meters and our down conductor detection with a plan to install over 1,100 new enabled devices on the system by the end of 2023, translating to over 75% coverage of high fire risk areas.",
			"Other programs being expanded for 2023 include our transmission pole clearing, our transmission operational controls, and further measures, including EPS sectionalizing to reduce customer impact. We expect to be sharing more with you on the incremental risk reduction associated with these programs at our Investor Day later in the month. Slide 6 is a reminder of our simple, affordable model, which continues to sit at the heart of our customer value proposition. We remain on track to deliver on at least 2% annual non-fuel O&amp;M reduction with our wildfire self-insurance and incremental vegetation management savings, providing line of sight on continuing to offset inflationary pressures this year. That's a good moment to bring up my story in the month, which has to do with revisiting the way we approach our work, and in this case, in our undergrounding program and how we're eliminating waste in our process.",
			"Historically, hitting these internal standards had required our underground electric lines to have at least 36 inches of cover. Upon revisiting this approach and reviewing regulations and the practices of other undergrounding utilities, we determined that 36 inches of cover is not required in most places, and there's little evidence that incrementally deeper conduits are meaningfully safer or more reliable than slightly shallower conduits. Therefore, in Q4 of last year, we revised our standard to only require 30 inches of cover, unless, of course, otherwise directed by permitting authority. While these may not seem like much, this 6-inch change in depth reduces the labor hours required to install our underground conduits and reduces the amount of spoils created during our trenching activities by approximately 17%.",
			"We're estimating that this change of 6 inches will save at least $25 million in 2023 alone. That's lower cost for our customers for the same ultimate value, getting our electric distribution lines underground and permanently reducing the risk. This is just the beginning of our waste elimination efforts. We're benchmarking with peers and reviewing where it's appropriate to put the conduits 24 inches deep, another 6 inches of potential savings, and we're analyzing the entire undergrounding delivery process through a value stream mapping exercise to identify further opportunities for efficiency, better customer and co-worker engagement and even more waste elimination. So many practices in large organizations like ours get memorialized and standardized into waste.",
			"Our fifth play and our focus on it will unlock value for customers in large and small ways for decades to come. Slide 7 recaps some of the key regulatory and policy catalysts we have in front of us for 2023. The one minor change is for Pacific Generation, where the ALJ recently added about a month to the schedule in response to request for additional time from the interveners. This will likely push the proposed decision from late 2023 into early 2024. And the sooner we get a final decision, the sooner we can bring the expected benefits to our customers. We know there is a lot on the plate at the CPUC at this time. We also know that we want what they want, a safer and more reliable system, which has enabled with timely approval of necessary infrastructure investments.",
			"In the meantime, we're improving our processes to make every dollar go further and building the case for the right investments to meet customers' expectations. I'll end here on Slide 8, with our report card reflecting on-track status for all of our operational and financial targets. I'm pleased to say we're on track to deliver on our commitments to both our customers and our investors despite the early challenges from winter storms. We are confident we have built a resilient conservative plan, which is designed to absorb the ups and downs of the business and the markets. As I like to say, we'll ride that roller coaster so you don't have to. And before I hand this over to Chris and Carolyn, I'll leave you with two additional notes on the financial front.",
			"First, we look forward to being eligible to reinstate our common dividend later this year, which we view as a key step in our return to financial health and essential for attracting the capital we need to deliver for our customers. As we announced on the year-end call, we expect to hit the required earnings level in the third quarter. Second, we've been encouraged to see the Fire Victim Trust continuing to monetize their stockholding and at growing values. The trust now owns around 6% of our stock, and as of last week, had distributed over $9 billion to their beneficiaries. And now I'll hand it over to Chris for some financial highlights.",
			"<strong>Chris Foster:</strong> Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. Today, we are reaffirming EPS growth of at least 10% each year in 2023 and 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026. We're also reaffirming our commitment to no equity in 2023 or 2024. As Patti mentioned, we are on track to deliver our 2023 financial commitment. This morning, I'm pleased to have Carolyn Burke joining me for the financial update. We plan to cover three main topics with you. To start, I'll review the drivers of our Q1 2023 financial results and review the key performance factors that we expect to see in the remaining nine months to deliver our full year 10% EPS growth. Carolyn and I will next provide a few highlights on regulatory, legal and legislative items.",
			"And Carolyn will then close this out with the reiteration of our value proposition. Let's start on Slide 9. On this slide, we're showing our results for the quarter and drivers we're forecasting for the next nine months as we locked our full year guidance of $1.19 to $1.23. For the first quarter, our results came in at $0.29. Versus first quarter last year, you see $0.02 of benefit from lower operating and maintenance costs, partially offset by $0.01 of redeployment. The lower O&amp;M spend is a result of the storms Patti spoke about earlier. With many of our co-workers activated on storm duty, less planned core work was completed during the first quarter of this year. This allowed us to redeploy funds to operational and enterprise programs. This nimble shift in priorities and execution is made possible by the capabilities we're building here at PG&amp;E, enabled by our lean operating system.",
			"Finally, you'll see we're calling out $0.02 of other, including some timing items. What you don't see is a meaningful impact directly from the storms. That is because of our long-established CEMA mechanism, which is an important constructive component of California utility regulation. Another driver not reflected explicitly, but to keep in mind, is a benefit from customer capital investment or rate base growth. As you know, a final decision in our 2023 general rate case is expected in the third quarter of this year. Consistent with past cases that Patti described, we will be allowed to record those catch-up revenues for prior quarters once the final decision is received. We're also reiterating our commitment and consistent focus on executing annual 2% non-fuel O&amp;M reductions.",
			"I'll remind you that we're planning conservatively and plan to deliver on target, no more, no less, redeploying any excess back into the business for the benefit of our customers. On Slide 10, our customer capital investments have not changed from year-end. We have tremendous opportunities to invest capital into our system for the benefit of customers to advance California's ambitious climate goals and support growing customer demand with the adoption of electric vehicles. This growth benefits our customers and our investors while providing additional cash flow from operations. And our simple, affordable model is how we plan to make this manageable for customers. Moving to Slide 11. In 2022, we exceeded our non-fuel O&amp;M cost reduction target, taking 3% out of the business despite inflation.",
			"We use those savings to serve customers and derisk the 2023 plan, which assumes continued inflationary cost pressures. As I mentioned on the year-end call, we see more opportunities for customers ahead, and the team is just getting started in terms of finding cost savings and eliminating waste. Let's move to Slide 12. We believe performance is power. So we intend to continue to deliver on operational commitments serving our customers better and making our systems safer every day. We expect that delivering these results will help us achieve better regulatory and financial outcomes, and California has the regulatory structure in place to help us do just that. Starting at the top of the slide, our 2023 cost of capital is final at 10%. This decision covers the three-year period through 2025, providing certainty for our investors.",
			"The cost of capital decision also continues to provide for a trigger mechanism. Should interest rates remain where they are and the mechanism trigger, we would intend to file with the commission for an upward adjustment, consistent with the mechanism. Next is our pending 2023 general rate case. As a reminder, we've already reached resolution on our wildfire self-insurance settlement, saving customers up to $1.8 billion through 2026. Worth noting is that over 85% of our requested revenue requirement increase seeks to mitigate risk in our gas and electric operations and deliver a level of safety that our customers expect and deserve. Our Pacific Generation allocation continues to move through the CPUC process. A final decision is now expected in early 2024 based on the schedule update from the ALJ.",
			"We are gearing up to launch the marketing on a parallel path, and we expect to do so this quarter. I'll next cover our pending wildfire-related cost recovery applications. With our 2020 WMCE costs now in rates, the net unresolved balance at the end of the first quarter is approximately $4.8 billion. We've settled our 2021 WMCE, resolving all elements apart from the cost in our Vegetation Management Balancing Account. As Patti mentioned, in the past week, we were pleased to receive a proposed decision recommending that we be granted 100% of the interim rate relief we had requested in our 2022 WMCE application. This amounts to some $1.1 billion over 12 months. This will be a constructive recognition of the importance of timely cash recovery, a key focus for the company.",
			"Not only would this outcome reduce financing costs for customers, it would also result in tangible work being executed sooner than would otherwise have been the case, including in the current year. The recently published schedule calls for a final decision in the overall 2022 WMCE application as soon as Q1 of next year. We're advocating for timely resolution in all of our WMCE cases. Resulting cash flow will allow us to accelerate our progress toward improved balance sheet health, improving FFO to debt and providing resources to enable us to meet customer growth demands on the system faster. It's my pleasure to now hand it over to Carolyn Burke.",
			"<strong>Carolyn Burke :</strong> Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everybody. At the bottom of this slide, we're highlighting some milestones and next steps of the two key pieces of state legislation passed last year. In addition to the DOE confirmation that Diablo Canyon is eligible for federal funding through the Civil Nuclear Credit Program, we were also granted a waiver by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to continue operating the units beyond their current license expiration dates, while we work through the full relicensing process. Also during the first quarter, the California Energy Commission in consultation with the CAISO and CPUC issued a needs determination, supporting extended operations at Diablo Canyon to provide electric system reliability in the state.",
			"Finally, in terms of the undergrounding, I'll remind you that the pending 2023 general rate case includes our request through 2026, as does our recently filed 2023 Wildfire Mitigation Plan. We will be prepared to file our 10-year plan later this year, dependent on the guidance from the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety. Once we file, OEIS will have nine months to review before going to the CPUC, who will also have nine months for their review. Now as many of you know, California is my new home. As shown here on Slide 13, I'm quickly and happily learning that California's regulatory construct makes this a great place to do business. In addition to the protections provided for under Assembly Bill 1054 and the CEMA tracker Patti and Chris discussed earlier, PG&amp;E also benefits from decoupled rates and a three-year cost of capital set independently from a four-year forward-looking rate case.",
			"And this is just to name a few. Our strong regulatory environment is an advantage that we will never take for granted. As Chris mentioned, performance is power, and we know we must perform. We understand that affordable customer bills help us not only mitigate financial and regulatory risk, but also importantly, help us as we continue to build trust with our customers, our regulators and our policymakers. As the incoming CFO, I intend to continue to build upon the sector-differentiating simple, affordable model that Patti and Chris put in place. The implementation of our lean operating system is helping PG&amp;E improve the customer experience, reduce O&amp;M, enhance capital work plan throughput and quite simply, making PG&amp;E a more enjoyable place to work for and with.",
			"This year, as part of engaging our co-workers on a lean method of waste elimination, we've established our waste elimination center. We are already tracking over 200 projects across the enterprise, and we're finding common themes throughout the business. First, there's a whole lot of over-processing. And second, there's a whole lot of defects requiring rework. That means a whole lot of opportunity. My co-workers are excited about tackling these issues and projects and driving improvements for the benefit of our customers. We're going after big and small opportunities, some simple and some complex. Take this simple example of customer mailings. U.S. postage rates are expected to increase about 7% this year. While we have no control over these mailing rates, we do control what we send to our customers.",
			"This waste elimination project is looking at what communications we can digitize or eliminate altogether. If we just eliminated one mailing per household per year, that's approximately $4 million in saved postage. As you can imagine, we're not stopping with just one mailing, and this elimination project saves more than just postage. As Patti mentioned earlier, we're going after large waste elimination projects, too, including in our undergrounding program. The team is excited to show you more examples out in the yard during our Investor Day in May, where we'll demonstrate waste elimination driving real unit cost savings and making permanent risk reduction affordable for our customers. I'll end here on Slide 14 by saying that our value proposition is strong, and it's improving every day.",
			"We are progressing towards meeting the common stock dividend eligibility threshold later this year. As a reminder, before declaring a dividend, we will first need to recognize a cumulative $6.2 billion in non-GAAP core earnings since our emergence from Chapter 11, starting from the third quarter 2020. For this purpose, non-GAAP core earnings means GAAP earnings adjusted for certain noncore items as described in our plan of reorganization. Our plan currently shows us reaching eligibility during the third quarter, although this remains subject to assumptions, including the timing of regulatory decisions. I'll remind you that regardless of timing, we plan to recommend to the Board that we start with a small dividend initially, feathering in growth over time.",
			"I'll leave you with this: We're on track for 2023 EPS growth target of at least 10%, at least 10% in 2024, at least 9% in 2025 and at least 9% in 2026. I'm looking forward to getting the chance to meet many of you in person during our upcoming Investor Day in California later this month. And lastly, I'd like to thank Chris for his generous support and advice during this transition period. I can't say enough about the incredibly strong team he has built here. Thank you, Chris.",
			"<strong>Chris Foster:</strong> Thanks, Carolyn. I'd like to say it's been my privilege to serve as CFO here at PG&amp;E and my time in prior roles over the last 11.5 years. I'm really proud of what we've accomplished, and we've built very strong five and 10-year plans. The emphasis now shifts to sound execution, which I have the utmost confidence this team can achieve. I'm also very confident that I'm handing the baton over to a very talented leader who we have shortly come to know as the perfect choice to take PG&amp;E's finance organization through its next chapter. With that, I'll hand it back to Patti to wrap.",
			"<strong>Patricia Poppe :</strong> Thank you again, Chris, and welcome, Carol. In closing, we are solidly on track for another year of consistent performance in 2023. We look forward to sharing more details with you on our progress and our confidence in the outlook at our California Investor Day on May 24 and May 25. While we do have a virtual option for the main slide presentation, for those of you wondering whether to make the trip, there will be a lot more for you to see and experience outside of that webcast window. We'll be showcasing some of our key technology, including wildfire risk reduction, EPSS and undergrounding. We also want to give you a better understanding of why we're confident we can execute our plan, including our 10,000-mile undergrounding program.",
			"At our in-person event, you'll also get to hear directly from key California stakeholders, including policymakers, customers and other critical partners as we continue writing the next chapter of the PG&amp;E story. We really hope to see you here in this great state of California at the end of the month. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.",

			"Dominion Energy (D) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.99 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.98 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.",
			"This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.02%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this energy company would post earnings of $1.03 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.06, delivering a surprise of 2.91%.",
			"Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.",
			"Dominion Energy , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, posted revenues of $5.25 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17.45%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.28 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.",
			"The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.",
			"Dominion Energy shares have lost about 7.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 5.8%.",
			"<b>What's Next for Dominion Energy?</b>",
			"While Dominion Energy has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?",
			"There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.",
			"Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.",
			"Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Dominion Energy: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.",
			"It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.83 on $3.91 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.89 on $17.46 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.",
			"Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Utility - Electric Power is currently in the top 39% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.",
			"One other stock from the same industry, Algonquin Power &amp; Utilities (AQN), is yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2023. The results are expected to be released on May 11.",
			"This utility operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.15 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -28.6%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.3% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.",
			"Algonquin Power &amp; Utilities' revenues are expected to be $784.58 million, up 6.6% from the year-ago quarter.",

			"<strong>Glen Donovan</strong>",
			"Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Sempra's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. A live webcast of this teleconference and slide presentation are available on our website under the Investors section. <br/>Here in San Diego, we have several members of our management team with us today, including: Jeff Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Trevor Mihalik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Kevin Sagara, Executive Vice President and Group President; Justin Bird, Chief Executive Officer of Sempra Infrastructure; Allen Nye, Chief Executive Officer of Oncor; Peter Wall, Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and other members of our senior management team. <br/>Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. <br/>Earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis. And we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. <br/>We also encourage you to review our 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only of today, May 4, 2023. And it's important to note that the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. <br/>With that, please turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Jeff.",
			"<strong>Jeffrey Walker Martin</strong>",
			"Thank you all for joining us today. We're excited to report that through the first 4 months of this year, we've accomplished several significant objectives that advance our business strategy and position the company for future success. <br/>We're off to a great start for this year. So what I'd like to do is provide you updates on several key business developments, growth opportunities over the next half decade and our EPS guidance for 2023 and 2024. After that Trevor and Justin will walk us through the business and financial achievements for our three growth platforms. And at the end of today's call, we'll reserve time for your questions. <br/>Turning now to business developments. Oncor completed its base rate review last month with an updated ROE of 9.7% and a continuation of its existing equity layer of 42.5%. This constructive outcome provides strong support for Oncor's credit ratings and the expanded capital spending that's needed to meet the strong growth that's continuing to occur across its service territory. <br/>Just last week, Oncor's Board met and reviewed the company's updated 5-year capital plan, which increased from roughly $15 billion to $19 billion. Oncor continues to see strong demand growth on its system and the need to make additional capital investments in transmission, distribution and new technology to continue improving safety and reliability. It's also important to note that we expect Oncor management will again refresh their long-term capital plan in the future with a view toward increasing it for the roll-forward 5-year period ending in 2028. <br/>Next, I'd like to mention that I'm pleased with the recent positive final investment decision at Port Arthur LNG. It's an important milestone that highlights the growing franchise value of Sempra Infrastructure and how well positioned that platform is for continued growth through the end of the decade. <br/>We also have a lot of respect for ConocoPhillips and their management team. Their participation in the capital structure and offtake creates strong alignment with us for successful execution of the project. I would note as well that we're bullish about future LNG opportunities and expect the U.S. LNG capacity will grow annually at a double-digit clip through the end of the decade and that Sempra Infrastructure is well positioned to help the U.S. extend its leadership position in this area. <br/>With these developments and a newly updated view of our planned capital spending across all three growth platforms, we're announcing Sempra's new 2023 to 2027 capital plan of $40 billion. Note, too, that this number only includes Sempra's proportionate ownership share of the capital being allocated to Oncor and Sempra Infrastructure, including Port Arthur LNG. <br/>This year, we're celebrating Sempra's 25th anniversary. Our 20,000 employees are on a mission to build North America's leading energy infrastructure company. And it's our commitment to innovation, sustainability and leadership that guides our disciplined investment strategy. We aim to provide a growing and competitive dividend while also increasing the company's earnings per share over the long term at rates of growth that continue to trend above the industry average. <br/>With that backdrop, we're affirming our full year 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range of $8.60 to $9.20 and issuing our full year 2024 EPS guidance range of $9.10 to $9.80. Together, this updated guidance and our new capital plan provide a solid foundation for our long-term projected 6% to 8% compounded annual EPS growth rate, which we're also affirming today. <br/>Now I'll turn the call over to Trevor to discuss our 5-year capital plan in more detail and provide a summary of our business and financial results.",
			"<strong>Trevor Ian Mihalik</strong>",
			"Thanks, Jeff. We continue to see robust opportunities to invest in our utilities and infrastructure businesses, resulting in a $40 billion 5-year capital plan, which, as Jeff mentioned, is approximately $5 billion higher than the previous plan. I'll briefly summarize the expected spending at each business. <br/>At Sempra California, their 5-year $21.4 billion capital plan is aligned with the state's priorities, which include safety, reliability, wildfire mitigation and sustainability with a focus on customer affordability. At Sempra Texas, the $15.3 billion capital plan includes our proportionate share of Oncor's $19 billion plan. Expected spending is in response to robust economic and demographic growth that is occurring across the state. As Jeff mentioned, we expect this capital plan will likely be revised upward in the future. <br/>At Sempra Infrastructure, its new capital plan of $3.6 billion now includes Sempra's proportionate share of Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, assuming Sempra Infrastructure's targeted 25% ownership level. To fund this growth, our customary approach is to start by reinvesting operating cash flows and raising debt financing at our regulated utilities in line with our authorized capital structures. <br/>We also evaluate other financing options, such as project-level debt and equity and asset sales before issuing common equity at the parent, all with the goal of solving for the lowest cost of capital. This approach is consistent with our past convention, where we've raised efficient financing through various asset and minority equity stake sales and our financing of Port Arthur LNG Phase 1. <br/>Overall, this approach of sourcing the lowest cost of capital has allowed us to maintain a strong balance sheet and continue to return capital through our growing dividend, all while providing flexibility to support infrastructure investments and deliver strong financial performance. The key takeaways for me as the CFO is that this is an exciting time for Sempra. And we have improved visibility to a portfolio of opportunities to capture strong growth across this decade. <br/>Please turn to the next slide. Over the next 5 years, our rate base is expected to increase at an average annual growth rate of 9% with over 70% dedicated to electric infrastructure. This growth reflects the positive macroeconomic tailwinds in our core markets and attractive regulatory environments. <br/>Please turn to the next slide, where I'll speak to Sempra California's and Sempra Texas' accomplishments this quarter and their updated capital plans. Beginning with SoCalGas, you'll recall that in late 2022, the CPUC issued its decision for the Angeles Link memorandum account, which also directed SoCalGas to work with the state in its application to the DOE for hydrogen hub federal funding. In doing so, SoCalGas is honored to be a partner with more than 100 other entities to support California's application. <br/>According to DOE, clean hydrogen hubs are expected to create a network of producers, consumers and local connected infrastructure to accelerate its implementation as a scalable clean energy source. SoCalGas is excited to support the state's application and looks forward to advancing the development of critical new infrastructure to support cleaner fuels for the benefit of its customers. <br/>Further, customer affordability is a top priority. That's why SDG&amp;E has been working closely with regulators to proactively develop solutions to reduce bills while continuing to enhance customer safety and reliability. SDG&amp;E is advancing several initiatives that we believe will improve the overall affordability of its services. <br/>First, it recently filed a joint proposal with the other two large investor-owned utilities in the state to redesign electric rates to include a fixed charge, which is intended to make electricity more affordable and encourage broader support for the electrification across the state. A proposed decision is expected in early 2024. <br/>Also, SDG&amp;E announced that it submitted an application to DOE seeking up to $100 million in federal matching funds to support the strategic undergrounding and hardening of overhead power lines in and near federally recognized tribal nations land within a service territory. SDG&amp;E would invest an additional $100 million towards this effort, subject to approval from the CPUC. Exploring options to tap into federal funding for infrastructure hardening is a great example of how SDG&amp;E is working to advance safety and reliability in a more cost-efficient manner for our customers. <br/>Further, the California ISO recently issued a draft 20-year transmission outlook, which included several important projects in SDG&amp;E's service territory that would support further renewable integration and overall grid reliability. Within the draft plan, the projects identified meet both reliability and policy objectives. The estimated cost of these projects are approximately $500 million based on reliability needs and an estimated $3 billion for projects consistent with state policy, which will be subject to a competitive bid process. <br/>The draft plan is anticipated to be reviewed by the CISO Board later this month. We're encouraged to see their outlook is beginning to incorporate the higher expected electrification loads that will be needed to further decarbonize the state in accordance with state policies. Additionally, we expect the ongoing general rate cases at SDG&amp;E and SoCalGas to establish the critical foundation for meeting the future needs of customers. <br/>Importantly, our filings are centered around delivering cleaner energy, safely and reliability in alignment with California's sustainability goals. Based on the current schedule, we expect a proposed decision in the second quarter of 2024 with rates retroactive to the beginning of that year. <br/>In the meantime, SDG&amp;E is continuing to execute a state-of-the-art wildfire mitigation plan, advancing the integration of utility storage and distributed resources and supporting electrification for the transportation sector. For SoCalGas, Scott and his team are focused on continuing to make improvements in the safety and integrity of the natural gas system while preparing its infrastructure for the delivery of cleaner fuels. <br/>Please turn to the next slide. Moving to Sempra Texas. I'm pleased to report that Oncor is off to a strong start to the year. As Jeff mentioned, Oncor received a constructive final order for its base rate review in April, which preserved Oncor's equity layer at 42.5% and updated its ROE to 9.7%. As part of its decision, the commission recognized Oncor for its track record of excellent reliability of service, even with the extreme weather events that have occurred in its service territory. <br/>This regulatory outcome has bolstered our confidence in the regulatory construct in the state. Having received the final order, Oncor updated its 5-year capital plan for 2023 through 2027 to $19 billion with a view toward making critical investments that support growth in the Texas economy and benefits customers through improved reliability of service. <br/>Also, as a reminder, as part of Sempra's agreement to acquire Oncor in 2017, we committed to deploying $7.5 billion for the 5-year period from 2018 to 2022. At the end of 2022, Oncor had invested nearly $12 billion over that same period or nearly 60% more than its 2017 regulatory commitment. And now its 5-year plan anticipates $19 billion of investments, which is 2.5x its original regulatory commitment at the time of Sempra's investment. <br/>Increases to Oncor's new capital plan are expected to support: growing generation interconnections, which are primarily related to renewables and clean power; strong premise growth; grid resilience and reliability; and technology and innovation advancements on the grid. You've heard us talk a lot about the attractiveness of this market in the past. In part, it's because Oncor benefits from the efficient capital recovery tracker mechanisms that are designed to limit lag associated with its investments. <br/>There is now pending legislation that we are following that could improve Oncor's capital efficiency even further. In particular, SB 1015, if passed, would provide for two DCRF filings per year instead of the one that Oncor currently operates under. Passage of the bill would reduce regulatory lag and further support Oncor's efficient deployment of capital. <br/>From an operational perspective, Oncor had another strong quarter with a 41% increase in active and retail transmission interconnection requests at the end of March compared to the same time last year. Also, premise growth continued to be robust in the first quarter, where Oncor connected 17,000 new premises. <br/>Please turn to the next slide, where I will turn the call over to Justin to provide an update on Sempra Infrastructure.",
			"<strong>Justin Christopher Bird</strong>",
			"Thanks, Trevor. Sempra Infrastructure had a strong first quarter of strategic accomplishments, particularly across its LNG and net-zero business lines, where continued demand for cleaner, more secure energy has strengthened the need for future development. <br/>On the Gulf Coast, we've had several positive developments I want to highlight. I'll speak to Port Arthur in a moment. But first, in March, FERC approved Cameron LNG Phase 2's amendment to transition from gas turbines to electric drives. The completion of this work stream is critical to the development of the project. Given its competitive position to deliver LNG to customers in Europe and Asia, we remain confident in the attractive upside opportunity offered by this proposed expansion. <br/>As a reminder, we expect that Cameron partners will take their share of offtake and SI will sell its share of volumes under back-to-back contracts. We continue to advance the competitive feed process. We've been targeting the completion of this process later this summer. <br/>Consistent with our disciplined approach to project development, we and the Cameron partners may extend this process beyond the targeted time frame to reduce construction risk, project cost and optimize the construction schedule through COD. We would expect to take FID after completing the FEED process as well as the project financing. <br/>At Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, we reached a positive final investment decision in March. We closed on $6.8 billion of nonrecourse project debt and executed definitive equity financing agreements, which paves the way to advance the project. We continue to target closing our transaction with KKR this summer, pending regulatory approvals. <br/>The momentum on Phase 1 sets us up well for a potential Phase 2 expansion at the facility. And it's important to note that SI has retained rights over the associated development and common facilities. We're continuing development work on the proposed expansion. And last month, we were pleased to receive the environmental assessment from FERC, citing no adverse impact, another positive step in our development. <br/>Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 was a great example of our strategic approach of collaborating with world-class partners to identify and execute investments with long-term contracted cash flows, all with a view of creating incremental value to our owners. We're continuing to execute this strategy, capturing new opportunities to support energy security and the global energy transition. <br/>In Sempra Infrastructure's new capital plan, we have included Sempra's targeted proportionate share of the $13 billion projected capital expenditures at Port Arthur LNG Phase 1. Sempra Infrastructure Partners is targeting a 20% to 30% ownership interest in the project. Based on Sempra's 70% ownership of Sempra Infrastructure Partners and assuming its 25% target ownership in the project, we're including approximately $2 billion in our capital plan. <br/>As a reminder, our planning convention is to only include projects that have reached FID. And therefore, our plan does not currently include Cameron LNG Phase 2, Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 or other development opportunities where we haven't taken FID yet. <br/>As you look to the robust growth opportunities that we've outlined in the appendix, I also would highlight we're now including the Port Arthur Louisiana Connector Pipeline. The pipeline would support 2 Bcf per day of feed gas supply for Port Arthur from the strategically located Gillis hub. <br/>Please turn to the next slide. With FID at Port Arthur now behind us, I'm excited to provide you the first update on construction progress and how quickly teams, led by Bechtel, have mobilized to start construction. There are already approximately 450 people on site, including both the Bechtel and SI teams. <br/>As a result, the site is changing daily. Clearing of the areas for the two LNG trains and two storage tanks is almost complete. And we've already started soil stabilization. We're doing this all with a firm eye on maintaining both a strong safety culture and deep community support for the project. <br/>Please turn to the next slide, where I'll turn it back over to Trevor to discuss Sempra's financial results.",
			"<strong>Trevor Ian Mihalik</strong>",
			"Thanks, Justin. Turning to Sempra's financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter 2023 GAAP earnings of $969 million, or $3.07 per share. This compares to first quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $612 million, or $1.93 per share. On an adjusted basis, first quarter 2023 earnings were $922 million, or $2.92 per share. This compares to our first quarter 2022 earnings of $924 million, or $2.91 per share. <br/>Please turn to the next slide. The variance in the first quarter 2023 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year can be summarized by the following. At Sempra California, $32 million of higher net interest expense at SoCalGas and SDG&amp;E and lower income tax benefits at SoCalGas, primarily from flow-through items netted against lower income tax expense at SDG&amp;E, primarily from flow-through items, partially offset by $14 million, primarily from higher CPUC and FERC base operating margin at SDG&amp;E and lower CPUC base operating margin at SoCalGas. <br/>At Sempra Texas, $35 million of lower equity earnings, primarily due to higher depreciation expense, interest expense, O&amp;M and lower revenue from decreased consumption, partially offset by higher revenues from rate updates and customer growth. <br/>At Sempra Infrastructure, $56 million of lower earnings, driven by the sale of a minority interest in Sempra Infrastructure, more than offset by $71 million of higher earnings, primarily from the transportation business in Mexico, asset optimization and higher LNG diversion fees, partially offset by higher net interest expense and lower income tax benefit. <br/>And other items at Sempra parent, which includes $36 million of lower costs, primarily driven by return on investments, supporting certain nonqualified benefit plans and higher income tax benefits, partially offset by higher net interest expense. <br/>Please turn to the next slide. We have a clear strategy to build leading T&amp;D infrastructure businesses in some of the most attractive markets in North America. And we have demonstrated a consistent ability to identify and deploy capital into attractive regulated and long-term contracted businesses. We have also taken concerted steps to simplify our business model into three growth platforms. <br/>And this has improved our capital discipline and allowed us to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders over short- and long-term investment periods. Now with our updated capital plan and favorable macroeconomic tailwinds, paired with disciplined financial and operational execution, we believe we're well positioned to continue delivering an attractive dividend and compelling earnings per share growth. <br/>Please turn to the next slide. On our fourth quarter earnings call in February, we outlined our commitment to resolving some key outstanding items. And in just 2 months, we've delivered on those priorities, including: Oncor receiving a constructive base rate review, supporting our view that Texas continues to be a very strong regulatory environment; taking FID and beginning construction at our LNG development project at Port Arthur, which sets the stage for additional growth at Sempra Infrastructure; announcing a record 5-year capital plan at Sempra of $40 billion, anchored by Oncor's new $19 billion capital plan; and issuing our 2024 EPS guidance range. <br/>As we look ahead, we continue to prioritize creating value for our shareholders while supporting our customers. To deliver on this commitment, we're focused on the following: receiving a constructive outcome on our ongoing rate cases in California by the middle of next year, which will pave the way for the next 4 years of expanded investments in safety, reliability and sustainability; executing on our strategy of building modern energy networks underpinned by our new record 5-year capital plan; and continuing to capture incremental capital opportunities at Sempra Infrastructure from our growing development pipeline of LNG and other large-scale infrastructure projects. <br/>As I've talked about this before, delivering in these areas provides enhanced visibility to future growth and, coupled with our strong position in highly attractive markets, gives us confidence in our ability to create meaningful value for our shareholders through the end of this decade. <br/>With that, this concludes our prepared remarks. And we will now stop and open the line to take your questions.",

And I guess, how quickly would you seek to adjust the plans and filings to reflect any changes from legislators, especially items that reduce ROE lag or implement a resiliency planning framework, et cetera?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey Walker Martin</strong>",
			"Thank you, Shar. Our approach has been to basically put together a 2023 update as well as a 2024 plan. It contemplates a number of outcomes. And I would say, independent of those outcomes in Texas, we would stick to the same plan we have on The Street now.",
			"<strong>Shahriar Pourreza</strong>",
			"Got it. But so the Texas legislation is not in the numbers, I just wanted to confirm that.",
			"<strong>Jeffrey Walker Martin</strong>",
			"Our current expectation, and we're going to -- we don't want to front-run the legislature, is that we do get some constructive outcomes. And we expect that the DCRF benefit, if it were to pass, is within the range and currently in the plan.",
			"<strong>Shahriar Pourreza</strong>",
			"Okay. Got it. And then just on the growth rate, as you guys start reaching COD on ECA and reaching full earnings run rates over '25 and '26 and Port Arthur in '27, 9% rate base growth in your 5-year plan and contributions from FID projects, cost of capital trips, I guess, you seem to have a lot more tailwinds than tail risks in that 6% to 8%. I guess, what are we missing? Are there other drags we should be thinking about?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey Walker Martin</strong>",
			"Yes, it's a great question. One of the things we've talked about internally is you would expect your earnings growth over time to pretty much track your capital growth over time. So that's one of the reasons we have a lot of confidence in that 6% to 8% range. But I would actually take the opportunity, Shar, to make two other comments here. <br/>First, one of the things we oftentimes tell our investors are that our past financial results should be a good indicator of our future performance. I think you and I have had this conversation before. But over the past 10- and 20-year periods, we've consistently been able to grow our earnings per share at rates and the rates of roughly 7% to 8%. And even more recently, in the 5-year period, you'll recall that we've been able to grow our earnings per share at an annual growth rate of just over 10%. <br/>So to your point, when you start looking forward, we have reaffirmed our 6% to 8% EPS growth rate. And I've always wanted to be very clear. It's not a quarter-by-quarter or year-over-year type of forecast. We're really truly focused, as you point out, on growing the business over the long term and particularly through the end of the decade. <br/>So from my perspective as the CEO, I think the takeaway from today's call is that our announcement of a $40 billion capital plan makes us even more confident in our long-term forecast. And I would tell you through the end of the decade, given all the opportunities that are in front of us, and you outlined many of them, I would be disappointed if we didn't exceed the high end of that range.",
			"<strong>Shahriar Pourreza</strong>",
			"Perfect. That's what I was trying to get at. Very clear cut, and congrats on the execution seriously.",
			"<strong>Jeffrey Walker Martin</strong>",
			"Thanks, Shar. We appreciate it.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.",
			"<strong>Steven Isaac Fleishman</strong>",
			"Yes, a couple of questions. So just could you talk to your funding plan for the higher CapEx? And I guess, specifically, it looks like in the appendix that there's some additional shares in the '24 guide. Could you just talk to what's driving that and the like?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey Walker Martin</strong>",
			"Sure, I'd be glad to. We've got Trevor with us. And maybe, Trevor, you could take a step back and give us an overview of the financing plan.",
			"<strong>Trevor Ian Mihalik</strong>",
			"Yes, sure, Jeff. I'd be happy to. So Steve, if you take back and you look over the last 5 years, we really have taken steps to strengthen our balance sheet and our credit metrics. And we did include kind of a summary in the appendix of the slide deck of each of the businesses on their credit carrying a stable outlook. <br/>But as part of that process, we've also developed an efficient loading order when you look at seeing how we source the lowest cost of capital to fund these businesses. So first, we've taken concrete steps to simplify the business and then to sell non-core assets. And then we've recycled that into new investments. And that process really occurs on a routine basis. <br/>Secondly, we do evaluate debt and equity at the project level. And Steve, a good example of that would be what we recently did at Port Arthur with that announcement, where we just circled over about $10 billion of third-party debt and equity. <br/>And then third, we've also had success in efficiently raising capital at our operating companies. And there, you saw us do that with KKR and ADIA by bringing them into the capital structure of SI, which has allowed us to raise over $5 billion. <br/>And then finally, we can always raise debt and equity at the parent level if we determine that's in the best interest of our shareholders. And so bottom line is we're always focused on financing growth that is most beneficial to our shareholders. And we're pretty excited about this capital plan that's in front of us.",
			"<strong>Steven Isaac Fleishman</strong>",
			"Okay. No, that's really helpful. But just specifically to the '24, the share count goes up. Is that some kind of plan for just like an ATM or something or...",
			"<strong>Trevor Ian Mihalik</strong>",
			"No, I think that's just some of the shares that are -- we've got in the plan for employee benefit plans and other things like that, so...",
			"<strong>Steven Isaac Fleishman</strong>",
			"Okay. Got it. All right. That's very helpful. And then on Port Arthur, within the 2027, is it -- I mean, I know you're -- it's not like your stake is 25% and the like. But just is it -- is that first trained in for the whole year? Or does it not come until later in the year, so it's really not showing up in the last year of the plan yet?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey Walker Martin</strong>",
			"Yes, the way you thought about it, Steve, is train 1 comes online in 2027 with train 2 coming online in 2028. It would be -- it would not have a material impact on the 2027 number.",
			"<strong>Steven Isaac Fleishman</strong>",
			"Right. So we're still seeing this growth without really seeing the (inaudible) at Port Arthur?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey Walker Martin</strong>",
			"That's correct. And the way to think about that would be -- you're absolutely correct. And the way to think about that would be the full run rate for Phase 1 of Port Arthur would be in 2029.",
			"<strong>Steven Isaac Fleishman</strong>",
			"Got it. Okay, that's helpful.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.",
			"<strong>Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith</strong>",
			"Look, let me just pick up on this earnings growth outlook here. And obviously, you guys gave us a '24 refresh here, nicely done. Should we expect growth in '25 to be maybe higher than the 6% to 8% range, given that, as you say, maybe 6% to 8% was a little less than '24? How do you think about the perhaps potential lumpiness of certain growth years? Or should we expect improvement to be maybe later-dated with LNG contributions, if you can expand on that?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey Walker Martin</strong>",
			"Yes, appreciate it. One of the comments I was making earlier was that we don't think about it in terms of quarters or years necessarily. The big issue that's needed to respond to you in 2025 is two things. It will be largely driven the outcome of our rate cases in California. <br/>And as you know, a lot of people don't put out guidance when they mailed a rate case or have a rate case pending. We've included a reasonable set of expectations for 2024. But that outcome, Julien, will have a big impact on 2025. And the second thing I'd call your attention to is we're still forecasting kind of a half year convention for ECA Phase 1 with ECA expected to COD in the summer of that year.",
			"<strong>Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith</strong>",
			"Right. Yes, a lot of different moving pieces in the plan. Actually, if you can elaborate a little bit, you commented a little cryptically on Cameron, on perhaps reevaluating the timeline a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the inflationary front, labor, et cetera, to be able to get some of these LNG projects done? <br/>Maybe a little bit of an updated timeline as you think to optimize that. And then related, I know there's been some challenges with the DOE here on extending timelines. Perhaps not entirely related, but I'm curious if you have any opinions on that related to the Cameron.",
			"<strong>Jeffrey Walker Martin</strong>",
			"Sure. Let me start with the policy shift, I think, that you're talking about. And I'll come back to the timing of some LNG projects and your inflationary question. So I'll take your second question first. You'll recall, Julien, that last year, the United States made a series of announcements with the EU and the United Kingdom about our country's support for their economic and energy security. We found that to be very constructive. <br/>And more recently, that was updated at the G7 meeting, where the U.S. came forward and affirmed the importance of global LNG for energy security and climate goals. So I think the DOE was constructive in putting out both of those statements on behalf of the United States. We're certainly continuing to track the statements they've made here more recently. But our initial assessment is it highlights the significant value of derisked projects that are under construction or actively moving forward, like ECA Phase 1 and Port Arthur. <br/>And it probably discourages projects that are not materially progressing. So based on our experience in the sector, the market and the regulators tend to coalesce around projects that have a higher likelihood of being successful. And we continue to have confidence that our projects, in particular, are well positioned relative to that standard. <br/>On the issue of timelines, there's no question that interest expense and inflation and supply chain issues are impacting the whole industry. You would likewise expect that to be happening on the LNG side. But right now, we don't see any movement in terms of how we're thinking about future COD dates in some of our projects. But I thought it might be helpful to Justin to do two things. Maybe provide just a short update for Julien's benefit on Cameron expansion but also talk about the excitement you're seeing around interest in Port Arthur Phase 2.",
			"<strong>Justin Christopher Bird</strong>",
			"Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Let me start with Cameron Phase 2. So Julien, I think importantly, we and the partners continue to advance the project. And there's a lot of excitement around this expansion at Cameron. As we noted, we received FERC's approval of our amendment and now have a fully permitted project. On the offtake side, we expect the Cameron partners will take their share. And as we've said before, we will share -- sell our share of volumes on a back-to-back basis. <br/>The competitive FEED process does continue to advance. I think the way I would clarify is that if we and the partners see the opportunity to, most importantly, accelerate the expected start of commercial operations and thus the cash flows, while at the same time, reducing project risk and cost, we're willing to spend a little bit more time upfront and we would be willing to extend the competitive FEED process. I guess, on an overall basis, my statement would be we continue to advance it. It's a priority project. And I'd say we and the partners are very committed to bring this forth. We think it's a great project. <br/>I would say in terms of Port Arthur Phase 2, we've already had a successful start. We talked about the FID. And I would say, building on that success, we're seeing strong interest in Phase 2 expansion, which will create significant scale in the Gulf Coast. So we're continuing to work on marketing. We're continuing to work on permitting and construction. And then once those three are wrapped up and we have commercial arrangements, we'll move forward to the financing phase. But lots of excitement around Port Arthur Phase 2 and basically I would say the business in general.",
			"<strong>Jeffrey Walker Martin</strong>",
			"I would add to it as well, I made this comment we were talking about the policy issues from Washington. When you see projects like Phase 1 going forward, Julien, it's really been helpful to coalesce interest for Phase 2. So I think the thing that's really interesting is we're really drawing a lot of market interest for Phase 2 at this time.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question will come from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI.",
			"<strong>Durgesh Chopra</strong>",
			"Just I have one quick clarification, hopefully. Trevor, just on the equity front, the plan through 2026, the former plan, you were very clear that there's no equity through 2026. And I appreciate you went through the different sources of financing in responding to Steve's question. Is that still the case through 2027 that is no equity? Or could we see equity at the Sempra consolidated level as you sort of advance through your capital plan? If you could just clarify that for us.",
			"<strong>Jeffrey Walker Martin</strong>",
			"Yes. And Durgesh, I'll be glad to take that. I mean, Trevor spoke to this issue of kind of the loading order we use to source lowest cost of capital. And the way I think about it, Durgesh, is in the equity markets, right, you have some companies that are really strong as income-based equity stories, some are growth stories. I think what we've tried to do is stake out a position in the utility space as being one of the leading growth and income stories. <br/>So when you think about all the options today with higher rates and the more competitive corporate yields, I think we're well positioned to continue to attract investor interest around our story today. We've just raised our capital plan $5 billion. We've got a track record of being very, very efficient in our financing. <br/>You're referencing prior years, where our plan was smaller. And there was no scenario where we thought we were going to issue equity. And I think what we're telling you now is, we've got a very robust plan. And we're going to go through the same loading order that Trevor described and solve for what we might need in 2027 or 2025 because it's dynamic, right? <br/>You've got issues changing in Texas in the legislation. You've got a dynamic situation now, where Phase 2 of Port Arthur and Cameron expansion is not currently in the capital plan. But right now, as we see it, we've got a really good plan to execute on. And we've got a track record of sourcing the lowest cost of capital. And we're doing this through the lens of what drives the most values to our owners. I think that's the best way to respond to your question.",
			"<strong>Durgesh Chopra</strong>",
			"That makes a ton of sense. I appreciate that clarification.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And we have time for one more question. Our last question will come from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan Securities.",
			"<strong>Jeremy Bryan Tonet</strong>",
			"Just wanted to kind of pivot towards the zero solution -- net-zero solutions, as you talked about before, from SIP. And wondering what updated thoughts you have on that side post passage of the IRA, if Louisiana gets primacy in Class VI wells for CCS, just wondering if you could update us there as far as potential customer interest in these services.",
			"<strong>Jeffrey Walker Martin</strong>",
			"Yes. Two things I'll mention, and I'll pass it to Justin to provide some overview of some of the projects we're looking at relating to the net-zero solutions business. One is something that I think is oftentimes overlooked is one of the most important bills that Biden administration passed earlier was the infrastructure bill, which really earmarks $8 billion or $9 billion for the formation of hydrogen hubs. <br/>We've talked about that in Trevor's prepared remarks. That's something that's got a lot of excitement both in Texas and also here in California. And our utilities are a big part of promoting particularly, the L.A. Basin, as an opportunity for hydrogen hubs. So I think that's something outside of the SI business, where you're going to expect to see leadership from Sempra's utilities. <br/>Relative to SI on the IRA bill, there are a number of things there that are helpful. Number one, it's really going to incent both solar and wind to come on to the system. That calls for more expansion of what we talked about in growth at Oncor as they look to basically meet the needs of extending transmission and distribution in their service territory. <br/>But it also does a lot to help us in terms of our underground storage plans for carbon sequestration and also some of the hydrogen and green fuel opportunities that we're looking at in Sempra infrastructure. And maybe, Justin, you could talk about some of the progress that you're making on the development side.",
			"<strong>Justin Christopher Bird</strong>",
			"Yes, will do. Jeremy, let me start by talking a little bit about Hackberry carbon storage. So as Jeff mentioned, we are actively pursuing solutions to enable net-zero GHG emission goals for energy and industrial facilities, including our own LNG facilities. The foundational initiative really is Hackberry. This is located in Hackberry, Louisiana. And it's in development. <br/>And it was intended to basically permanently sequester carbon dioxide from the Cameron LNG joint venture and potentially other industrial facilities in Southwest Louisiana and Southwest Texas. As you mentioned, we have filed an application with EPA for Class VI. Louisiana is working with EPA about primacy. And we have announced a participation agreement with our Cameron LNG partners. <br/>And look, IRA is important. The $50 per ton to $85 per ton will support this project. We're also looking at potentially developing carbon sequestration and capture around the Port Arthur facility. So we think there's opportunities to not just reduce carbon output of our own facilities but potentially expand that to some of those other industrial facilities in the region. <br/>On hydrogen hub, and I'll be brief, so we're looking at a lot of early-stage efforts. We are participating in three separate hubs that have been encouraged and have filed applications with the DOE. One is around the Port of Corpus Christi, another in the Gulf and others in Texas and Louisiana. So we are looking for opportunities to support hydrogen as one of the many clean molecules that we think will fuel the future.",
			"<strong>Jeremy Bryan Tonet</strong>",
			"Got it. That's very helpful. And just kind of...",
			"<strong>Jeffrey Walker Martin</strong>",
			"Go ahead.",
			"<strong>Jeremy Bryan Tonet</strong>",
			"Unless you had anything else to add there, I was just going to pivot to another question.",
			"<strong>Jeffrey Walker Martin</strong>",
			"No, please go ahead to the next question.",
			"<strong>Jeremy Bryan Tonet</strong>",
			"And I was just pipping towards California here, how might efforts around income-based electric charges influence your affordability work in California? And is there anything unique about SDG&amp;E's service story here that we should be thinking about relative to the other California IOUs?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey Walker Martin</strong>",
			"I don't think so. I mean, obviously, we currently have the lowest bills in the state relative to the other two investor-owned utilities. Part of that is we benefit from more moderate climate. But we've got kind of a three-part program that we're currently pursuing. And I would just -- I'm going to pass it to Kevin to address this in a second. He's our Group President for California. <br/>But one thing I would tell you that I think is important to remember, we're most successful when our customers are succeeding. And I will tell you that affordability is top of mind for our management team. This has been a tough 2- or 3-year period, where we've seen the cost of living increase. Inflation doesn't just impact the businesses, it impacts consumers. <br/>So part of our social compact with our local community is we need to demonstrate every day how hard we're working to maintain low cost and that we're going to bat for them and looking for new and better ways to improve the affordability of our services. I think we're pretty excited about some of the programs we have underway. There's a lot more work to be done. But Kevin, perhaps you could summarize kind of the three-pronged attack that we have on affordability.",
			"<strong>Kevin Cristopher Sagara</strong>",
			"Yes. Thank you for that, Jeff. Yes, it's definitely a three-pronged attack, really focused around cost control, obtaining funding from parties other than our customers and rate reform. You mentioned the fixed charge effort, Jeremy. On the O&amp;M front, we need to continue to be laser-focused on controlling costs and improving efficiency by streamlining and automating various business processes to gain efficiencies. <br/>And this includes digitizing everything. A good example of how our culture of embracing technology translates to savings for our customers would be in the wildfire mitigation area, where our industry-leading program directly translates to significantly lower insurance premiums. <br/>A second focus would be around sourcing funds from outside our customers, like programs under the infrastructure bill. Trevor mentioned some of this in his remarks. We can seek funds outside of our customers, like the infrastructure bill, investment tax credits and other sources of federal funding and advocating for use of securitization as a tool to spread the cost of certain programs over more years. <br/>And the third area of focus would be pushing for meaningful rate reform to make our customer bills more predictable, affordable and equitable. Examples of this would be advocating for the fixed charge for which there is an open proceeding currently at the CPUC and removing the public purpose program charges from our bills and into the state's general fund. So we always need to be laser-focused on affordability. And we have a number of work streams currently underway.",
			"<strong>Jeffrey Walker Martin</strong>",
			"Yes, the only thing I would add, too, Jeremy, is I think this affordability issue, particularly around this fixed charge that you referenced, what the state really wants to get to is a transition toward higher levels of electrification, particularly in the transportation space. And by moving to a fixed charge, it has the benefit of lowering the rate for electricity. And it makes it more competitive against the fuels that you see in transportation. <br/>So I think you've got several things taking place there, where we have a variety of programs which are intended to limit cost to consumers but also make electricity more competitive. And Sempra here in California and in Texas is strongly supporting electrification.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Jeff Martin for any additional closing remarks.",
			"<strong>Jeffrey Walker Martin</strong>",
			"Sure. I'd just like to close by thanking everyone for joining today. I know we've got a lot of feedback through a lot of other competing calls this morning. So we appreciate everyone taking the time to join our call. Per custom, if there are any follow-up items, please take the time to reach out to our Investor Relations team with any additional questions. So this concludes our call.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PG&amp;E Corporation First Quarter 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) <br/>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jonathan Arnold, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.",
			"<strong>Jonathan P. Arnold</strong>",
			"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for PG&amp;E's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With us today are Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer; Chris Foster, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Carolyn Burke, our Executive Vice President of Finance, who will step into the CFO role later today. We also have other members of the leadership team here with us in our Oakland headquarters. <br/>First, I should remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results. These statements are based on information currently available to management. Some of the important factors, which could affect our actual financial results, are described on the second page of today's first quarter earnings call presentation. <br/>The presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures. The slides, along with other relevant information, can be found online at investor.pgecorp.com. We would also encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, which was released earlier today. <br/>And with that, it's my pleasure to hand the call over to our CEO, Patti Poppe.",
			"<strong>Patricia Kessler Poppe</strong>",
			"Thank you, Jonathan, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by noting that this will be Chris Foster's last earnings call with PG&amp;E. Thank you, Chris, for your commitment and service to our company over the past 11 years. <br/>Since we announced our CFO transition in March, Chris has worked tirelessly to ensure an orderly transition to Carolyn Burke, who will formally take over as our CFO later today. So thank you, Chris, for your friendship, your leadership and your dedication to serving our customers and investors. <br/>And a formal welcome to Carolyn, who brings a wealth of financial experience to PG&amp;E as we continue on our journey remaking the company as a top-performing regulated utility. You'll all have opportunities to get to know Carolyn at upcoming events, including at our Investor Day in California later this month. <br/>We know you have a lot of calls occurring today. And since we've had a strong quarter, and we'll be seeing many of you in just a couple of weeks, we'll be crisp and to the point. Let's get started. <br/>Turning to our results on Slide 3. You'll see we reported first quarter 2023 non-GAAP core earnings of $0.29 per share. This result keeps us on track with our plan for the year. One timing item to consider is our 2023 general rate case. As is common with California GRCs, we have a memo account in place, which will allow for new rates to be implemented retroactive to January 1, meaning that after the final decision is reached, we'd expect to begin recognizing the GRC outcome along with the prior quarter's catch-up. <br/>The case schedule calls for a proposed decision in the second quarter and a final decision in the third quarter. We continue to communicate with all stakeholders how important it is to have a timely decision in order to have the resources we need to deliver for our customers. <br/>Also today, we reaffirm our full year 2023 core EPS guidance of $1.19 to $1.23, which at the midpoint represents an increase of 10% over 2022. We also reaffirm our previously stated longer-term targets of at least 10% core EPS growth in 2024 and at least 9% for 2025 and 2026. Also unchanged is our plan for no new equity issuance through 2024. <br/>As we've said before, we'll work to manage the business through ups and downs like weather, regulatory timing, interest rates and inflation, while delivering the safety and reliability investments that our customers need and the consistent financial results our investors expect. <br/>Here on Slide 4, I'll review some of the highlights and proof points as we continue to make progress on mitigating risk, both physical and financial. On wildfire risk mitigation, we filed our 2023 wildfire mitigation plan at the end of March, which further builds on the layers of protection approach from our 2022 plan. <br/>Record winter rains and snowfall have left our hydro assets in a stronger position than they've been in for some years. <br/>CEMA, our catastrophic event memorandum account is one of the constructive features of the California regulatory model. It enables us to focus on serving customers when they need us the most, while we track and defer for future recovery much of the costs associated with these historic weather events. We recorded several hundred million dollars of repair and restoration work to the CEMA account between December and March. <br/>Meanwhile, our customer restoration efforts and storm response have been well received in our communities, and our performance benefited from the investments we have made in technology, situational awareness and emergency response coordination. <br/>We've also continued to see more constructive policy outcomes, building on last year's passage of legislation supporting our establishment of a 10-year undergrounding plan as well as the state's decision to extend the life of the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant. <br/>Highlights in the first quarter include our wildfire self-insurance plan, which enjoyed unusually strong support from interveners. <br/>We were also pleased to receive the Nuclear Regulatory Commission waiver, allowing our 2 Diablo Canyon nuclear units to continue operating beyond their current license expiration dates, while the NRC is considering the renewal applications. We expect to file our applications with the NRC by year-end. <br/>And most recently, in the past week, we were encouraged by the proposed decision issued in our 2022 WMCE proceeding. This would grant our full request for $1.1 billion of interim rate relief while allowing for collection over 12 months, also as requested. <br/>The PD could be voted out by the CPUC as soon as the June 8 meeting, and we will be advocating for a timely adoption so that customer benefits can be realized. These benefits include millions of dollars in customer financing savings as well as providing cash funding to accelerate investment. This will facilitate us delivering needed safety, reliability and customer connections work. <br/>I'm also happy to report on continued progress mitigating financial risk. Our simple, affordable model and deployment of waste elimination, the fifth play of our lean operating system, enables improving the customer experience while keeping us on track to deliver our 2% annual O&amp;M savings in spite of weather and inflation. <br/>Also, in support of customer affordability, we worked with the state to offset commodity price increases on winter bills with an acceleration of the annual California Climate Credit. Overall, during the winter gas commodity price run-ups, our procurement team was able to save customers over $1 billion through a series of thoughtful measures including a diversified portfolio that includes interstate pipeline capacity reaching back to the supply basins, natural gas storage and financial hedging. <br/>Turning to Slide 5. we continue to estimate that our layers of protection have mitigated over 90% of wildfire risk through the combination of inspections, physical hardening, our Enhanced Powerline Safety Settings, Public Safety Power Shutoffs and improved situational awareness and response. <br/>While 2022 did not bring the typical high-wind events that would trigger PSPS, we did see an increase of over 30% in high fire risk base given the significant drought conditions. Despite this increased risk, our EPSS program resulted in a reduction of 69% in CPUC reportable admissions, along with 99% fewer acres impacted for EPSS-enabled mines versus the pre-EPSS baseline for 2018 to 2020 average. <br/>Our 2023 wildfire mitigation plan builds on these core elements and will also see us deploy additional operational mitigations such as partial voltage detection, which leverages our existing smart meters and our down conductor detection with a plan to install over 1,100 new enabled devices on the system by the end of 2023, translating to over 75% coverage of high fire risk areas. <br/>Other programs being expanded for 2023 include our transmission pole clearing, our transmission operational controls, and further measures, including EPSS sectionalizing to reduce customer impact. <br/>We expect to be sharing more with you on the incremental risk reduction associated with these programs at our Investor Day later in the month. <br/>Slide 6 is a reminder of our simple, affordable model, which continues to sit at the heart of our customer value proposition. We remain on track to deliver on at least 2% annual non-fuel O&amp;M reduction with our wildfire self-insurance and incremental vegetation management savings, providing line of sight on continuing to offset inflationary pressures this year. <br/>That's a good moment to bring up my story of the month, which has to do with revisiting the way we approach our work, and in this case, in our undergrounding program and how we're eliminating waste in our process. Historically, hitting these internal standards had required our underground electric lines to have at least 36 inches of cover. <br/>Upon revisiting this approach and reviewing regulations and the practices of other undergrounding utilities, we determined that 36 inches of cover is not required in most places, and there's little evidence that incrementally deeper conduits are meaningfully safer or more reliable than slightly shallower conduits. <br/>Therefore, in Q4 of last year, we revised our standard to only require 30 inches of cover, unless, of course, otherwise directed by permitting authority. While these may not seem like much, this 6-inch change in depth reduces the labor hours required to install our underground conduits and reduces the amount of spoils created during our trenching activities by approximately 17%. We're estimating that this change of 6 inches will save at least $25 million in 2023 alone. That's lower cost for our customers for the same ultimate value, getting our electric distribution lines underground and permanently reducing the risk. <br/>This is just the beginning of our waste elimination efforts. We're benchmarking with peers and reviewing where it's appropriate to put the conduits 24 inches deep, another 6 inches of potential savings, and we're analyzing the entire undergrounding delivery process through a value stream mapping exercise to identify further opportunities for efficiency, better customer and coworker engagement and even more waste elimination. <br/>So many practices in large organizations like ours get memorialized and standardized into waste. Our (inaudible) play and our focus on it will unlock value for customers in large and small ways for decades to come. <br/>Slide 7 recaps some of the key regulatory and policy catalysts we have in front of us for 2023. The one minor change is for Pacific Generation, where the ALJ recently added about a month to the schedule in response to request for additional time from the interveners. This will likely push the proposed decision from late 2023 into early 2024. And the sooner we get a final decision, the sooner we can bring the expected benefits to our customers. <br/>We know there is a lot on the plate at the CPUC at this time. We also know that we want what they want, a safer and more reliable system, which has enabled with timely approval of necessary infrastructure investments. In the meantime, we're improving our processes to make every dollar go further and building the case for the right investments to meet customers' expectations. <br/>I'll end here on Slide 8, with our report card reflecting on track status for all of our operational and financial targets. I'm pleased to say we're on track to deliver on our commitments to both our customers and our investors despite the early challenges from winter storms. <br/>We are confident we have built a resilient conservative plan, which is designed to absorb the ups and downs of the business and the markets. As I like to say, we'll ride that roller coaster so you don't have to. <br/>And before I hand this over to Chris and Carolyn, I'll leave you with 2 additional notes on the financial front. <br/>First, we look forward to being eligible to reinstate our common dividend later this year, which we view as a key step in our return to financial health and essential for attracting the capital we need to deliver for our customers. As we announced on the year-end call, we expect to hit the required earnings level in the third quarter. <br/>Second, we've been encouraged to see the Fire Victim Trust continuing to monetize their stockholding and at growing values. The trust now owns around 6% of our stock, and as of last week, had distributed over $9 billion to their beneficiaries. <br/>And now I'll hand it over to Chris for some financial highlights.",

			"Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. Today, we are reaffirming EPS growth of at least 10% each year in 2023 and 2024 and at least 9% in 2025 and 2026. We're also reaffirming our commitment to no equity in 2023 or 2024. As Patti mentioned, we are on track to deliver our 2023 financial commitments. <br/>This morning, I'm pleased to have Carolyn Burke joining me for the financial update. We plan to cover 3 main topics with you. <br/>To start, I'll review the drivers of our Q1 2023 financial results and review the key performance factors that we expect to see in the remaining 9 months to deliver our full year 10% EPS growth. Carolyn and I will next provide a few highlights on regulatory, legal and legislative items. And Carolyn will then close this out with the reiteration of our value proposition. <br/>Let's start on Slide 9. On this slide, we're showing our results for the quarter and drivers we're forecasting for the next 9 months as we walk to our full year guidance of $1.19 to $1.23. For the first quarter, our results came in at $0.29. Versus first quarter last year, you see $0.02 of benefit from lower operating and maintenance costs, partially offset by $0.01 of redeployment. <br/>The lower OEM spend is a result of the storms Patti spoke about earlier. With many of our coworkers activated on storm duty, less planned core work was completed during the first quarter of this year. This allowed us to redeploy funds to operational and enterprise programs. This nimble shift in priorities and execution is made possible by the capabilities we're building here at PG&amp;E, enabled by our lean operating system. <br/>Finally, you'll see we're calling out $0.02 of other, including some timing items. What you don't see is a meaningful impact directly from the storms. That is because of our long-established CEMA mechanism, which is an important constructive component of California utility regulation. <br/>Another driver not reflected explicitly, but to keep in mind, is a benefit from customer capital investment or rate base growth. As you know, a final decision in our 2023 general rate case is expected in the third quarter of this year. Consistent with past cases that Patti described, we will be allowed to record those catch-up revenues for prior quarters once the final decision is received. <br/>We're also reiterating our commitment and consistent focus on executing annual 2% non-fuel O&amp;M reductions. I'll remind you that we're planning conservatively and plan to deliver on target, no more, no less, redeploying any excess back into the business for the benefit of our customers. <br/>On Slide 10, our customer capital investments have not changed from year-end. We have tremendous opportunities to invest capital into our system for the benefit of customers to advance California's ambitious climate goals and support growing customer demand with the adoption of electric vehicles. This growth benefits our customers and our investors while providing additional cash flow from operations. And our simple, affordable model is how we plan to make this manageable for customers. <br/>Moving to Slide 11. In 2022, we exceeded our non-fuel O&amp;M cost reduction target, taking 3% out of the business despite inflation. We use those savings to serve customers and derisk the 2023 plan, which assumes continued inflationary cost pressures. <br/>As I mentioned on the year-end call, we see more opportunities for customers ahead, and the team is just getting started in terms of finding cost savings and eliminating waste. <br/>Let's move to Slide 12. We believe performance is power. So we intend to continue to deliver on operational commitments serving our customers better and making our systems safer every day. We expect that delivering these results will help us achieve better regulatory and financial outcomes, and California has the regulatory structure in place to help us do just that. <br/>Starting at the top of this slide, our 2023 cost of capital is final at 10%. This decision covers the 3-year period through 2025, providing certainty for our investors. The cost of capital decision also continues to provide for a trigger mechanism. Should interest rates remain where they are and the mechanism trigger, we would intend to file with the commission for an upward adjustment consistent with the mechanism. <br/>Next is our pending 2023 general rate case. As a reminder, we've already reached resolution on our wildfire self-insurance settlement, saving customers up to $1.8 billion through 2026. Worth noting is that over 85% of our requested revenue requirement increase seeks to mitigate risk in our gas and electric operations and deliver a level of safety that our customers expect and deserve. <br/>Our Pacific Generation allocation continues to move through the CPUC process. A final decision is now expected in early 2024 based on the schedule update from the ALJ. We are gearing up to launch the marketing on a parallel path, and we expect to do so this quarter. <br/>I'll next cover our pending wildfire-related cost recovery applications. With our 2020 WMCE costs now in rates, the net unresolved balance at the end of the first quarter is approximately $4.8 billion. As a reminder, We've settled our 2021 WMCE, resolving all elements apart from the cost in our vegetation management balancing account. <br/>As Patti mentioned in the past week, we were pleased to receive a proposed decision recommending that we be granted 100% of the interim rate relief we had requested in our 2022 WMCE application. This amounts to some $1.1 billion over 12 months. This will be a constructive recognition of the importance of timely cash recovery, a key focus for the company. Not only would this outcome reduce financing costs for customers, it would also result in tangible work being executed sooner than would otherwise have been the case, including in the current year. <br/>The recently published schedule calls for a final decision in the overall 2022 WMCE application as soon as Q1 of next year. We're advocating for timely resolution in all of our WMCE cases. Resulting cash flow will allow us to accelerate our progress toward improved balance sheet health, improving FFO to debt and providing resources to enable us to meet customer growth demands on the system faster. <br/>It's my pleasure to now hand it over to Carolyn Burke.",
			"<strong>Carolyn J. Burke</strong>",
			"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everybody. At the bottom of this slide, we're highlighting some milestones and next steps of the 2 key pieces of state legislation passed last year. <br/>In addition to the DOE confirmation that Diablo Canyon is eligible for federal funding through the Civil Nuclear Credit Program, we were also granted a waiver by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to continue operating the units beyond their current license expiration date, while we work through the full relicensing process. <br/>Also during the first quarter, the California Energy Commission in consultation with the CAISO and CPUC issued a need determination, supporting extended operations at Diablo Canyon to provide electric system reliability in the state. <br/>Finally, in terms of the undergrounding, I'll remind you that the pending 2023 general rate case includes our request through 2026, as does our recently filed 2023 wildfire mitigation plan. We will be prepared to file our 10-year plan later this year, dependent on the guidance from the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety. Once we file, OEIS will have 9 months to review before going to the CPUC, who will also have 9 months for their review. <br/>Now as many of you know, California is my new home. As shown here on Slide 13, I'm quickly and happily learning that California's regulatory construct makes this a great place to do business. <br/>In addition to the protections provided for under Assembly Bill 1054 and the CEMA tracker Patti and Chris discussed earlier, PG&amp;E also benefits from decoupled rates and a 3-year cost of capital set independently from a 4-year forward-looking rate case. And this is just to name a few. <br/>Our strong regulatory environment is an advantage that we will never take for granted. As Chris mentioned, performance is power, and we know we must perform. We understand that affordable customer bills help us not only mitigate financial and regulatory risk, but also importantly, help us as we continue to build trust with our customers, our regulators and our policymakers. <br/>As the incoming CFO, I intend to continue to build upon the sector-differentiating simple, affordable model that Patti and Chris put in place. The implementation of our lean operating system is helping PG&amp;E improve the customer experience, reduce O&amp;M, enhance capital work plan throughput and quite simply, making PG&amp;E a more enjoyable place to work for and with. <br/>This year, as part of engaging our coworkers on a lean method of waste elimination, we've established our waste elimination center. We are already tracking over 200 projects across the enterprise, and we're finding common themes throughout the business. First, there's a whole lot of overprocessing. And second, there's a whole lot of defects requiring rework. That means a whole lot of opportunity. <br/>My coworkers are excited about tackling these issues and projects and driving improvements for the benefit of our customers. We're going after big and small opportunities, some simple and some complex. <br/>Take this simple example of customer mailings. U.S. postage rates are expected to increase about 7% this year. While we have no control over these mailing rates, we do control what we send to our customers. This waste elimination project is looking at what communications we can digitize or eliminate altogether. If we just eliminated 1 mailing per household per year, that's approximately $4 million in saved postage. As you can imagine, we're not stopping with just 1 mailing, and this elimination project saves more than just postage. <br/>As Patti mentioned earlier, we're going after large waste elimination projects, too, including in our undergrounding program. The team is excited to show you more examples out in the yard during our Investor Day in May, where we'll demonstrate waste elimination driving real unit cost savings and making permanent risk reduction affordable for our customers. <br/>I'll end here on Slide 14 by saying that our value proposition is strong, and it's improving every day. We are progressing towards meeting the common stock dividend eligibility threshold later this year. <br/>As a reminder, before declaring a dividend, we will first need to recognize a cumulative $6.2 billion in non-GAAP core earnings since our emergence from Chapter 11, starting from the third quarter of 2020. <br/>For this purpose, non-GAAP core earnings means GAAP earnings adjusted for certain noncore items as described in our plan of reorganization. Our plan currently shows us reaching eligibility during the third quarter, although this remains subject to assumptions, including the timing of regulatory decisions. <br/>I'll remind you that regardless of timing, we plan to recommend to the Board that we start with a small dividend initially, feathering in growth over time. <br/>I'll leave you with this. We're on track for 2023 EPS growth target of at least 10%, at least 10% in 2024, at least 9% in 2025 and at least 9% in 2026. <br/>I'm looking forward to getting the chance to meet many of you in person during our upcoming Investor Day in California later this month. <br/>And lastly, I'd like to thank Chris for his generous support and advice during this transition period. I can't say enough about the incredibly strong team he has built here. Thank you, Chris.",
			"<strong>Christopher Foster</strong>",
			"Thanks, Carolyn. I'd like to say it's been my privilege to serve as CFO here at PG&amp;E and my time in prior roles over the last 11.5 years. I'm really proud of what we've accomplished, and we've built very strong 5- and 10-year plans. The emphasis now shifts to sound execution, which I have the utmost confidence this team can achieve. I'm also very confident that I'm handing the baton over to a very talented leader who we have shortly come to know as the perfect choice to take PG&amp;E's finance organization through its next chapter. <br/>With that, I'll hand it back to Patti to wrap.",
			"<strong>Patricia Kessler Poppe</strong>",
			"Thank you again, Chris, and welcome, Carol. <br/>In closing, we are solidly on track for another year of consistent performance in 2023. We look forward to sharing more details with you on our progress and our confidence in the outlook at our California Investor Day on May 24 and May 25. While we do have a virtual option for the main slide presentation, for those of you wondering whether to make the trip. There will be a lot more for you to see and experience outside of that webcast window. <br/>We'll be showcasing some of our key technology, including wildfire risk reduction, EPSS and undergrounding. We also want to give you a better understanding of why we're confident we can execute our plan, including our 10,000-mile undergrounding program. <br/>At our in-person event, you'll also get to hear directly from key California stakeholders, including policymakers, customers and other critical partners as we continue writing the next chapter of the PG&amp;E story. We really hope to see you here in this great state of California at the end of the month. <br/>With that, operator, please open the line for questions.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Steve Fleishman at Wolfe.",
			"<strong>Steven Isaac Fleishman</strong>",
			"Congrats to both Chris and Carolyn.",
			"<strong>Patricia Kessler Poppe</strong>",
			"Thanks, Steve.",
			"<strong>Steven Isaac Fleishman</strong>",
			"So -- you bet, Patti. So just first, any color in thinking on the situation going into this fire season just with all the rains and et cetera, just how you're thinking about how things stand versus the last few years?",
			"<strong>Patricia Kessler Poppe</strong>",
			"Yes. It's a great question, Steve. I know a lot of people have been wondering this. So I'll share a couple of things. One, we know that in some ways, the storms were beneficial from the perspective that trees -- aged and dying trees came down and at a time when fire was not a risk. So certainly, that was an advantage. But we also know that the fuels -- the grasses have a rich crop this year. <br/>But here's the thing that I want investors to really understand is the mitigations that we've put in place and the technology that we have deployed with EPSS gives us the ability to know in 2-kilometer blocks across our entire service area, what the conditions are real time, whether that's fuel moisture levels, wind conditions, temperatures, et cetera, grass levels, we know our system. And so EPSS puts us in a position to, regardless of weather and regardless of conditions, be prepared and derisk the system. It gives me a lot of confidence heading into wildfire season that we are prepared.",
			"<strong>Steven Isaac Fleishman</strong>",
			"Okay. Good. And then second question, just I have to ask again on the Fire Victim Trust, any sense on their kind of strategy or timing from here? In theory, I guess, you're close to the end? Any sense on that?",
			"<strong>Patricia Kessler Poppe</strong>",
			"Well, I would suggest we are close to the end, Steve. They're less -- well, there are just over a 6% holder today. And in their annual report, they've described their intentions. And we know that it's just less and less of a factor for us, and we're gratified. And I think the agreement worked out well for the beneficiaries as we've been -- as they've been able to sell their shares at an increasing value. So we feel like we've done our part to make it right, which has been a big priority for us.",
			"<strong>Steven Isaac Fleishman</strong>",
			"Makes sense. Great. And then just lastly on the GRC and the proposed decision. Just are you getting any sense of the timing within the second quarter and just the likelihood that it will actually come out in the second quarter and not get delayed?",
			"<strong>Patricia Kessler Poppe</strong>",
			"Well, I think we've been really clear with our stakeholders, and I do appreciate that the commission has a lot on their plate, but we all understand, and they want what we want, which is a safe system, which requires investment in the infrastructure. We just continue to reinforce the timely outcome on the GRC is really important, and we expect that they'll keep to the timing that they've published.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"We'll move next to Shar Pourreza at Guggenheim.",
			"<strong>Shahriar Pourreza</strong>",
			"And I'll echo Steve's comments around Carolyn and Chris. Congrats, guys, on phase 2, much, much.",
			"<strong>Carolyn J. Burke</strong>",
			"Thank you.",
			"<strong>Shahriar Pourreza</strong>",
			"Just wanted to -- Patti, if it's okay, just start off on the dividend, especially as we're getting closer to that eligibility threshold. I guess, what adjustments should we be thinking about beyond non-GAAP to get to that $6.4 billion net income threshold? And then more importantly, just in terms of timing, how long do you kind of anticipate it would take after meeting the threshold to actually kind of initiate the dividend? So if you meet the threshold in 3Q, would you have a tentative plan in place for framework, Board approval, et cetera? Or is there more back and forth that you anticipate as we think about the actual payment date?",
			"<strong>Carolyn J. Burke</strong>",
			"Yes. Shar. This is Carolyn. I'll take that question. So we've been pretty consistent, as you know, that we would -- we do expect to meet that eligibility in the third quarter. Our current plan suggests -- continues to suggest that. On the adjustments, so our plan of reorganization has a very specific calculation for the dividend-eligible earnings. And it is different from what we report as non-GAAP core earnings. There are some very specific line item adjustments. And our IR team would be happy to walk through that methodology with you separately. But I just want to make sure that you know that it is separate. It is different. <br/>On a practical matter, we want to have our audited financial statements to be able to support the eligibility of that calculation. So the earliest our Board would have the opportunity to declare a dividend would be with our third quarter earnings call. So that's the expectation at this point in time. Of course, it is subject, I will just say, to the GRC decision, some various -- the regulatory decisions that we're expecting in the third quarter.",
			"<strong>Patricia Kessler Poppe</strong>",
			"Yes. And Shar, this is Patti. I'll just pile on here with Carolyn, our capital allocation decisions are always about investing in the system, making sure that our priority is to make the system safer, faster, meet the needs of our customers. And so we're going to continue to balance that as we factor in the decision about size and pacing of growth.",
			"<strong>Shahriar Pourreza</strong>",
			"Got it. And then just on the -- now that the undergrounding program is in place, PMO is engaged. I guess, how are your thoughts evolving around longer-term undergrounding plan? Any expectations for that filing? And do you see any constructive variances versus the last update in the GRC.",
			"<strong>Patricia Kessler Poppe</strong>",
			"Yes. We're getting excited as we continue to make progress and build out this program. It's such an exciting part of the company, and the team leading it is just doing an incredible job learning new things and getting best practices from across other utilities and getting started. And so we're excited to file that 10-year plan. <br/>We expect that the 10-year plan will very much reflect our GRC and the 4 years that were included in our GRC. And just to remind that, that pending filing shows us doubling our mileage here in 2023 getting to 350 miles, ramping up to 450 miles in 2024, 550 miles in 2026 and then 750 miles in 2026 -- 550 miles, sorry, in 2025 and 750 miles in 2026. That ramp will be consistent with what we filed in our 10-year plan. <br/>And so based on the timing of that 10-year plan, we are waiting on feedback from OEIS on when they will receive that plan. We're ready to file that when they are ready to receive it. They're staffing up so that they can receive it. But I do think it's important for people to know that the first 4 years, including this year -- or the next 4 years, including this year, are reflected already in our GRC, including, obviously, the cost recovery associated with that. And so depending on the timing of the OEIS' availability to receive our 10-year plan has little bearing on the initial years of our undergrounding program.",
			"<strong>Shahriar Pourreza</strong>",
			"Perfect. That was very clear. Congrats, guys. We'll see you soon. Appreciate it.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And we'll go next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith at Bank of America.",

			"Thanks, Julien.",
			"<strong>Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith</strong>",
			"Let me start off with this. I mean, you guys have this Analyst Day coming up, and I want to call out, you have your earnings growth rate through '26, and you guys have been very careful to acknowledge the specific discrete growth rates in each year. You have your rate base growth through '27, how are you thinking about addressing if at all, some of the earnings considerations at the upcoming Analyst Day? I know that you've really placed an emphasis here on understanding the core of what you guys are doing, specifically in undergrounding at this Analyst Day. But I just wanted to call out that discrepancy between RAB and earnings growth, for instance, heading into this Analyst Day, if there were any expectations to set.",
			"<strong>Patricia Kessler Poppe</strong>",
			"Well, Julien, we take great pride in giving you multiple years forward expectations on earnings. I would suggest that there are some -- especially with the GRC coming out late after Investor Day that it's unlikely that we'll forecast any further than 2026, but we're pretty proud of the fact that we're giving you guidance through 2026.",
			"<strong>Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith</strong>",
			"No. I hear you. I just wanted to test that. I appreciate it though. I very much appreciate the considerations they're in. <br/>Separately and related here, can we talk about the Pacific Gen sale, and I understand and saw in your prepared remarks here some of the tweaks and timing with the ALJ, et cetera. But can you specifically address a little bit more your expectations today, where the conversations are with potential buyers and any of the consternation that might be coming up through the process as well from the regulatory side?",
			"<strong>Carolyn J. Burke</strong>",
			"Yes. No, I'll take that. This is Carolyn. We've actually seen pretty robust inbound interest in the asset. And so we do expect a fairly competitive process. I will say that the opportunity seems to be most interesting to those long-term infrastructure investors, but we have seen a wide range of interest. <br/>The portfolio, obviously, is pretty unique in that. It offers exposure to the full cost of service, regulated clean generation in California and without the direct risk of wildfires. So it's pretty attractive. <br/>And timing, as we've already mentioned, I mean it's really -- we do -- we've updated that. We're going to be going to market with investor -- with our process coming up in June is the expectation, so early summer. And then we would still expect that process to go forward through the balance of the year, simultaneous with the regulatory process and wouldn't expect to be closing until the first half of 2024.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"We'll go next to Anthony Crowdell at Mizuho Securities.",
			"<strong>Anthony Christopher Crowdell</strong>",
			"Just hopefully 2 quick questions. One on the cost of capital triggering mechanism. I believe that utility is going to file if rates stay where they are for an increase in cost of capital for 2024. Do you expect parties to file for a waiver, similar to, I think, what the utility filed for a waiver for in 2022 for the mechanism not to get reset lower? Is there an expectation that you do get parties also filing for a waiver?",
			"<strong>Christopher Foster</strong>",
			"Anthony, I think it's really a couple of considerations. First, there's a Phase 2 piece of this to keep in mind. So the commission is examining both the trigger itself and its treatment as well as an issue rerate, which is the yield spread adjustment in particular. So those are 2 that will be considered in the Phase 2. There's not actually a specific time frame around it. <br/>Stepping back and looking at the core of your question, I think you should assume from our standpoint that we would be filing for the upward adjustment, really consistent with that mechanism, Hard for me to predict where other interveners would come in. But at this stage, that would be our intention. <br/>From a planning standpoint, you can imagine if there is the potential for that trigger to trigger to the upside, that could actually just strengthen our plan further and provide us more capability to put more into the system.",
			"<strong>Shahriar Pourreza</strong>",
			"Great. And then lastly, Patti, it's on your, I guess, story of the month, I think you framed it as or savings a month of the undergrounding. And I understand the savings that you get by not having to bury the conduit, whatever, 36 inches and now you're at 26, but if I think of the -- probably a large component of the cost of undergrounding, maybe labor. And if I think of PG&amp;E is probably, on their gas side, has been burying gas pipe for 100 years. Like I don't -- can I expect any efficiencies in the digging trenches and putting a conduit down that (inaudible) considering you've been -- you probably have mastered the trenching of a conduit from the gas side of the business?",
			"<strong>Patricia Kessler Poppe</strong>",
			"Anthony, that's a great question. And first of all, I do remind people that all the time that we've been burying pipe for a long time. However, I would say the synergies that exist are that we can deploy our workforce. We actually have a program called [G2E], gas to electric, where we're enabling our gas workforce to do a lot of the civil work. <br/>All that to say, this undergrounding of electric lines has new technologies that we can deploy today that we're pretty excited about. And you'll get a chance to see those at our Investor Day, the actual equipment, whether it's a rock wheel or a plow-type piece of equipment or even at grade conduit in what's something called k-rail, which we'll be able to show you all these things at Investor Day. <br/>There's still much, much efficiency that we can gain, and we're really excited about all of the progress and the ideas that we're getting both from our partners as well as from our own work team in our gas division. So there's definitely a great synergy there to leverage.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And we'll take the next question from Ryan Levine at Citi.",
			"<strong>Ryan Michael Levine</strong>",
			"I guess to follow up on the waste elimination center comments, can you expand what type of projects or initiatives you're tracking beyond mail postage? I mean how material are some of these opportunities? Or any way to frame the scale?",

			"Yes. Well, the scale is really massive, Ryan. It starts -- I think the book ends of the mailing, which is $4 million of potential savings with just 1 mailing, all the way up to the story that I shared about the undergrounding, that's all borne out of waste elimination. Some other important focus areas for us in the waste elimination center are things like our new customer connection process improvement. I know that's an area of interest for a lot of people, and we've been making significant progress there in identifying waste in that process that we can eliminate and make a better outcome, a faster outcome for customers at a lower cost as well as other things like just bundling work. <br/>We have work often done in silos. So on 1 week, a crew might go out and change a cross arm and 2 weeks later, they might go out and change that very same pole. And so bundling work so that we get out there once and do it at the lowest cost possible and least disruptive for customers. <br/>The potential here, Ryan, I cannot describe is almost infinite. And when we get 26,000 of my coworkers all being proficient in being able to see waste for what it is and then eliminate it on a daily basis, this thing just runs itself. That's a -- it's a great future that lies ahead for this team and therefore, our customers.",
			"<strong>Ryan Michael Levine</strong>",
			"Good to hear. In terms of the CEMA exposure in the early part of the quarter, where is the balance for that as of the end of the quarter? And any time line for recovery through the regulatory process?",
			"<strong>Christopher Foster</strong>",
			"Sure. Just to help give you a feel for that. What we had filed earlier, Ryan, was a little over $300 million in impact so far. I will offer to you that's early. That number is going to go up. I would assume we're going to be in total -- if you look at all the storm impacts, we're talking about 13 (inaudible) rivers of impacts here, this is probably going to be over $500 million in impact. <br/>The CEMA related account, though, is a very consistent recovery mechanism. But as you go forward, we would typically complete the work, audit to work, make that filing, and you typically get around an 18-month to 2-year time line for resolution but been used really here in California for many years.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Patti Poppe for closing remarks.",
			"<strong>Patricia Kessler Poppe</strong>",
			"Thanks, Audra. And we really wanted to be mindful of everyone's time today and keeping this call short. So I'll just wrap with one -- couple of thoughts. <br/>One, our best wishes to Chris as he embarks on his next professional step. We're going to miss him, but we're excited and proud of everything that he's achieved and what he's going to achieve next. <br/>And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you at our Investor Days on May 24 and 25. We're excited to see that many of you have already registered, high demand for this event. So we're excited about that. There will be much for you to see live. It will not be possible on the webcast. And so we still have room, if you'd just like to join us, just make sure you register. <br/>We are definitely seeing progress here at PG&amp;E. And we want to be able to share that with you at our Investor Day. We want you to know that an investment in PCG is an investment in serving people, the planet and prosperity of many millions. And we're very proud of the progress that the team is making here. I want to share that with you at Investor Day. So we look forward to seeing you there. Please be safe out there, everyone.

Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share in the 2023 period exclude the gain and other impacts related to the sale of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses, Inc. (the Clean Energy Businesses). Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share in the 2023 and 2022 periods exclude the effects of hypothetical liquidation at book value (HLBV) accounting for tax equity investments, the net mark-to-market effects of the Clean Energy Businesses, and the related tax impacts on the parent company.",
			"\"We continued to produce strong financial results and solid returns for our shareholders this quarter as we invest in a clean energy future and deliver industry-leading reliability for our customers,\" said <span class=\"xn-person\">Tim Cawley</span>, the chairman and CEO of Con Edison. \"This quarter we completed the sale of our Clean Energy Businesses valued at <span class=\"xn-money\">$6.8 billion</span>, which strengthened our balance sheet and will allow us to sharply focus on the clean energy transition in New York.  We've helped our customers connect more than 700 megawatts of solar generation, a significant clean energy milestone, and their embrace of this renewable resource reduces the amount of fossil fuel-generated power in our region, meaning lower emissions and cleaner air. As we look forward this year and beyond, investment in clean, resilient, and reliable energy systems while delivering for our customers, partners, communities, and shareholders will be the foundation for our continued growth and success.\"",
			"For the year of 2023, Con Edison reaffirmed its previous forecast of adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of <span class=\"xn-money\">$4.75</span> to <span class=\"xn-money\">$4.95</span> per share. Adjusted earnings per share exclude the gain and other impacts related to the sale of the Clean Energy Businesses (approximately <span class=\"xn-money\">$2.25</span> a share after-tax), the effects of HLBV accounting for tax equity investments (approximately <span class=\"xn-money\">$(0.02)</span> a share after-tax), the net mark-to-market effects of the Clean Energy Businesses (<span class=\"xn-money\">$(0.03)</span> a share after-tax), and the related tax impacts on the parent company.",

Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate the analysis of Con Edison's financial performance as compared to its internal budgets and previous financial results and to communicate to investors and others Con Edison's expectations regarding its future earnings and dividends on its common stock. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are also useful and meaningful to investors to facilitate their analysis of Con Edison's financial performance.",

Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution earnings increased as a result of a higher allowed return on equity (ROE) due to a higher projected average annual 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yield in 2023. These factors were partially offset by lower Ameren Missouri earnings due to lower electric retail sales, driven primarily by milder-than-normal winter temperatures in the first quarter of 2023 compared to colder-than-normal temperatures in the year-ago period.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 78% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).",
			"Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.",
			"In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Ameren.",
			"<span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:View our latest analysis for Ameren;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nyse-aee/ameren?blueprint=2493037&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Ameren </a></span>",
			"Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.",
			"As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Ameren. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Ameren's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.",
			"Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Ameren is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 12%. T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 11% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 7.2% of the company stock.",
			"Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 14 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.",
			"While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.",
			"The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.",
			"I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.",
			"Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Ameren Corporation. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$119m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:see if those insiders have been buying or selling.;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nyse-aee/ameren/ownership?blueprint=2493037&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=integrated-pitch&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> see if those insiders have been buying or selling. </a>",
			"With a 21% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Ameren. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.",
			"It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Ameren better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Ameren has <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:3 warning signs  (and 1 which is concerning);elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nyse-aee/ameren?blueprint=2493037&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=integrated-pitch&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 3 warning signs </strong> (and 1 which is concerning) </a> we think you should know about.",

			"The good news? You don’t have to actively trade stocks to make money. You can also collect dividends.",

			"After all, even business magnate John D. Rockefeller once said, “Do you know the only thing that gives me pleasure? It's to see my dividends coming in.”",

			"Utility companies have long been a staple for dividend investors because of their reliability. Come what may, people will need to turn their lights on at night.",
			"FirstEnergy pays quarterly dividends of 39 cents per share, translating to an annual yield of 4% at the current share price.",
			"In the first quarter, the company earned a net income of $292 million, or 51 cents per share. In its earnings release, FirstEnergy affirmed its long-term target of annual operating earnings per share growth rate of 6% to 8%.",
			"Shares are down 7% year to date, but Morgan Stanley analyst Stephen Byrd sees a rebound on the horizon. Byrd has an Overweight rating on FirstEnergy and a price target of $48, implying a potential upside of 23%.",
			"Independent oil and gas exploration company Pioneer Natural Resources has been generous when it comes to returning cash to investors.",
			"Last month, the company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $3.34 per share, consisting of a base dividend of $1.25 per share and a variable dividend of $2.09 per share. On an annualized basis, the recently declared dividend gives Pioneer a yield of 6.3%.",
			"Because of the variable component, Pioneer’s payout may fluctuate significantly from one quarter to another. But the company also returns cash to investors through share repurchases.",
			"In the first quarter, Pioneer bought back 2.4 million shares for $500 million. The company also refreshed its share repurchase program with a new $4 billion authorization.",
			"Stifel analyst Derrick Whitfield has a Buy rating on Pioneer and a price target of $290. Considering that Pioneer currently trades at $210 per share, the price target suggests a potential upside of 38%.",

			"The company’s investment strategies include agency mortgage-backed securities, mortgage servicing rights and residential real estate.",
			"For the first quarter, Annaly paid a quarterly cash dividend of 65 cents per share. That comes out to an annual yield of 13.4%.",
			"The cash dividend was lower than before, but in the first quarter, the company generated earnings available for distribution of 81 cents per share, which was more than its payout for the quarter.",
			"In the latest earnings conference call, CEO David Finkelstein said, “We continue to maintain our defensive posture with economic leverage roughly unchanged on the quarter at 6.4 turns while outearning our rightsized dividend by $0.16.”",

Earlier today, ComEd presented its summer readiness plan and a look at its future work to the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC).",

While we spoke with the ICC about our preparations for this summer, the reality is that the work we do is meant to ensure reliability in the face of increasing severe weather and prepare the grid for the rapid growth of clean energy technologies.\"",
			"In ComEd’s presentation, Donnelly reviewed ComEd programs and processes to help protect against the impacts of severe weather, including Distribution Automation, a technology that has helped ComEd avoid more than 15 million customer outages; light detection and ranging, or Lidar, which helps to identify trees that might be more susceptible to the effects of climate change; and an outage prediction tool that uses analytics from system data to map out effective preventative maintenance.",
			"Last year, investments in the power grid continued to pay reliability dividends for ComEd customers as the electric company delivered record reliability. Since grid improvements began in 2011, overall reliability has improved more than 80 percent. In that time, ComEd has avoided more than 19 million power outages for customers, saving more than $3.3 billion in outage-related costs. In 2022, 85 percent, or nearly 3.5 million ComEd customers, experienced zero or one interruption in service.",

			"\"We are never just doing one thing at a time,\" said Donnelly. \"We build with an eye toward resiliency and preparing the grid for severe weather, as well as increased clean energy technology and decarbonization, so that we maximize the long-term benefit for customers every time we make improvements to the grid.\"",

Intervening parties in the proceeding have also filed motions for rehearing with respect to certain findings in the PUCT order.",

Revenue estimates were cut sharply as the analysts signalled a weaker outlook - perhaps a sign that investors should temper their expectations as well.",
			"After the downgrade, the consensus from DTE Energy's eleven analysts is for revenues of US$15b in 2023, which would reflect a considerable 17% decline in sales compared to the last year of performance. Statutory earnings per share are presumed to ascend 14% to US$6.23. Before this latest update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$17b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$6.21 in 2023. Indeed we can see that the consensus opinion has undergone some fundamental changes following the recent consensus updates, with a substantial drop in revenues and some minor tweaks to earnings numbers.",

			"Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. We would highlight that sales are expected to reverse, with a forecast 22% annualised revenue decline to the end of 2023. That is a notable change from historical growth of 7.2% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the same industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 3.5% annually for the foreseeable future. So although its revenues are forecast to shrink, this cloud does not come with a silver lining - DTE Energy is expected to lag the wider industry.",
			"The most obvious conclusion from this consensus update is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with analysts holding earnings per share steady, in line with previous estimates. Unfortunately analysts also downgraded their revenue estimates, and industry data suggests that DTE Energy's revenues are expected to grow slower than the wider market. Overall, given the drastic downgrade to this year's forecasts, we'd be feeling a little more wary of DTE Energy going forwards.",

			"Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for our first quarter earnings call. Our team of 19,000-plus employees have entered this first full year of operations after the separation, excited to lead the energy transformation as a premier T&amp;D utility, and it shows in our results. We are delivering our plan on course.<br/>I'll start on Slide 4, covering our key messages. We delivered strong year-over-year growth in the first quarter, earning $0.67 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.70 per share on a non-GAAP basis. These results keep us on track to deliver earnings within our guidance range of $2.30 to $2.42 per share for 2023. This is despite the impact of mild weather, which is a testament to the stability offered by the progressive largely decoupled rate-making mechanisms in our jurisdictions.<br/>Operationally, we have our best on record reliability performance at all 4 of our utilities with ComEd continuing to operate in the top decile. As it pertains to our rate cases, we are well underway in a number of jurisdictions with 3 new filings initiated since the fourth quarter earnings call, building a stronger, smarter, resilient and cleaner grid requires investment. We are engaging with our stakeholders to align on our shared goals and ensure this investment is compensated fairly as it is integral to our strategy.<br/>On February 15, Atlantic City Electric filed a distribution base rate case with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities to support investments in infrastructure to maintain safety, reliability and customer service for our customers. It also includes initial recovery for ACE's smart meter deployment which brings a host of benefits that Jeanne will highlight shortly.<br/>BGE filed its second multi-year plan on February 17 and Pepco D.C. filed its second MYP on April 13. Both MYP rate cases incorporate investments that enable the energy transformations guided by jurisdictional policy whether it be the Climate Solutions Now Act in Maryland or D.C.'s transformative energy policies like the D.C. Climate Action Plan.<br/>Finally Pepco expects to file its second MYP, our final anticipated base rate filing for the year with the Maryland Public Service Commission later this month. Jeanne will take the time to highlight the next steps across our open rate cases and provide additional details on the regulatory calender shortly. Now in working through these rate cases, we have several new commissioners expected across our jurisdictions including new chairs in placed or pending in Illinois, Maryland and Pennsylvania. And new appointees in Illinois and Maryland.<br/>We appreciate the service of the outgoing commissioners and are excited to begin working with the newest members on this next phase of the energy transformation.<br/>Given this transformation will be measured in decades, it reinforces the importance of building a shared forward-looking understanding of priorities and needs across a variety of stakeholders, which is accomplished through transparency and collaboration. This kind of approach supports continuity through the inevitable evolution in legislative and regulatory bodies over time.<br/>Lastly, we continue to reaffirm our existing expectations to be at the midpoint or better of our 2021 to 2025 and 2022 to 2026 6% to 8% annualized earnings growth ranges with dividend growth to match underpinned by the investments we are making on behalf of customers and earning an annual consolidated ROE in the 9% to 10% range during that time.<br/>Our diverse deconcentrated capital expenditure plan and predictable investment recovery frameworks contribute to the compelling risk-adjusted total shareholder return of 9% to 11% that we offer investors between our dividend and earnings growth through 2026. Our results are built on an operating philosophy that relentlessly pursues excellence, as is highlighted on the next slide.<br/>Slide 5 reviews our operating performance for the start of 2023. Beginning first with reliability. You can see that our utilities continue to operate at industry-leading levels, both in terms of outage frequency and outage duration. Both ComEd and PHI achieved best on record outage frequency performance. And all 4 utilities achieved best on record system outage duration performance.<br/>Now consistent with our focus on continually improving operations and customer value, we are now using total system outage time versus average customer outage duration as one of our reliability metrics. This refined metric better ensures we are comprehensively capturing the customer experience on an equitable basis in each of our service territories. This performance is a testament to the hard work that our employees put in each and every day. It also speaks to the effectiveness of the investments in reliability and resiliency that our utilities have made providing a great foundation as we discuss with our stakeholders the next phase of investments to support their energy transformations.<br/>As it pertains to safety, PHI is now operating at top decile levels and PECO is in the top quartile, both up from the second quartile last year, while BGE improved to second quartile from third quartile.<br/>Now while we are encouraged by the progress we have made on the safety front in the company, we have a safety-focused zero tolerance culture. We are using targeted training at each of our utilities, such as ergonomics awareness training at ComEd in light of its moved out to second quartile to address the areas driving underperformance.<br/>Gas odor response continues its run of top decile performance with all 3 utilities performing at world-class levels in 2023. PHI responded to all gas orders in less than an hour, achieving a perfect rating.<br/>Lastly, I want to spend a moment talking about customer satisfaction. As you can see, our 4 utilities are operating in the second quartile after 3 out of the 4 closed out 2022 in top quartile. While each operating company has unique areas to address, there are a few common trends. For instance, the block for communicating with customers around outages and reliability continues to be raised. As our customers increasingly rely on the grid, whether it be working remotely or charging their cars, they need access to information real time.<br/>We are excited about the investments we have made in the tools they already have at their disposal, such as mobile apps, and we will continue to invest in enhancements focused on improving communications. Although another area of focus is new technology through upgrades to our customer care and billing software. These investments will allow us to provide more options to meet customer needs around billing and other services and enhance self-service options for those experiencing slower turnaround times.<br/>But perhaps the primary driver of lower customer satisfaction scores relative to the latest available benchmark as of 2021 is one that is not unique to Exelon. While the inflationary environment has shown signs of abating recently, particularly around energy supply costs that are a pass-through for us, customers have been impacted by increased costs in many aspects of their lives and businesses. That's why we will continue to focus on maintaining more than average rates and overall bill levels.<br/>Again, rates in our cities are 23% below the average rate in the largest cities in the United States. And we have connected customers to increasing amounts of assistance as well, totaling over $1 billion the last 2 years, but we have to continue to articulate the value customers are receiving, and we will maintain focus on managing our own cost to live -- to deliver our product as efficiently as possible.<br/>We also addressed bill impacts in our approach to rate cases. Our proposed deferral of 35% of ComEd 2024 rate increase to 2026 is just one example. At this, PECO D.C. proposed expansion of the Residential Aid and Arrearage Management Programs. In short, we are leading the industry and customer satisfaction remained a top priority for us.<br/>Now Jeanne will provide an update on our financial performance for the first quarter. Jeanne?",

			"Thank you, Calvin, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our first quarter financial updates and progress on our 2023 rate case schedule. And I will also highlight the ways in which our utilities are advancing us smarter, stronger and cleaner energy grid to better serve all customers.<br/>Starting on Slide 6, we show our quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating earnings [loss]. As Calvin mentioned, Exelon earned $0.70 per share in the first quarter of 2023 versus $0.64 in the first quarter of 2022, reflecting growth of $0.06 per share over the same period. The earnings growth was driven primarily by $0.10 of higher distribution and transmission rates associated with incremental investments and completed rate cases including the uplift from higher treasury rates impacting ComEd's distribution ROE. <br/>We also benefited $0.03 from(inaudible) other onetime items from 2022, including the discontinued operations adjustment from the separation and the customer refund in Illinois. These items were partially offset by $0.05 of lower earnings due to the sustained warmer than normal temperatures throughout the winter impacting our non-decoupled jurisdictions in Pennsylvania and Delaware as well as $0.02 of higher interest expense due to the rising interest rates and higher level of debt at the holding company.<br/>Results of $0.70 per share in the first quarter reflecting approximate 30% contribution at the midpoint of our projected 2023 operating earnings guidance range. Historically, we have earned on average 28% of full year earnings in the first quarter. Heading into the 2023, we expected Q1 to be slightly ahead of historical patterns due to the completion of rate cases at PHI and PECO, rising treasury rates impacting ComEd's ROE relative to 2022 and the absence of the onetime items from separation.<br/>However, we are also seeing -- we were also seeing the impact of unfavorable weather at PECO and DPL Delaware.<br/>While the weather tempered some of that upside, we still delivered earnings ahead of expectations due to timing at PHI and the recognition of carrying costs related to the carbon mitigation credit balance at ComEd.<br/>Looking at it as a next quarter, after factoring in some PHI and year-over-year timing items, the relative EPS contribution in the second quarter is expected to moderate at approximately 17% of the midpoint in our projected full year earnings guidance range. The combination of Q1 and Q2 will result in achieving approximately 47% for projected full year earnings through the first half of 2023. This puts expected results for the first half of 2023, in line with how we performed last year, delivering 48% of our full year earnings in the first half of 2022.<br/>On a full year basis, we expect the $0.05 of unfavorable weather experienced in the first quarter to be offset with the combination of O&amp;M levers across the platform, favorable depreciation of PECO and the full year earnings impact of the carrying costs associated with the carbon mitigation credit regulatory asset balance.<br/>With this continued increase in rate base as we deploy capital for the benefit of our customers and our disciplined approach to cost management, we remain on track to deliver expected earned returns at the utilities within our 9% to 10% targeted range by year-end and are from our full year operating earnings guidance of $2.30 to $2.42 per share in 2023. <br/>In line with past practice, we would not expect to revisit projected 2023 guidance until the third quarter. And recall, our goal is always to achieve the midpoint or better of that range.<br/>Lastly, we are reaffirming the fully regulated operating EPS compounded annual growth target of 6% to 8% and from 2021 and 2022 guidance midpoint through 2025 and 2026, respectively, with the expectation to be at the midpoint or better of that growth range.<br/>Turning to Slide 7. As Calvin mentioned, there have been some important developments on the regulatory front since the last earnings call. <br/>Let me start by reminding you of 2 electric distribution rate cases in progress. First, Delmarva Power Delaware has revised the revenue request for $47.8 million increase based on an updated tax period in its electric distribution rate case with full proposed rates going into effect on July 15, subject to refund. We expect a decision in the second quarter of 2024. <br/>Additionally, as discussed previously, ComEd filed its electric distribution multiyear rate plan in January. And we expect intervenor testimony from the Illinois Commerce Commission staff on May 22, and the evidentiary hearing to be held in late August as the next key milestones. A final order in the ComEd multi-year plan case is expected no later than December 20. <br/>ComEd also filed its 2022 formula rate reconciliation, seeking recovery of $247 million in rates effective January 1, 2024. A key driver of the increase is the impact of U.S. Treasury yields starting to increase from their depressed levels experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, which, as you'll recall, was reflected in 2022 earnings. First, fact sheet and order is expected on the reconciliation by December 17.<br/>Since the last earnings call, there were 3 new rate cases filed. First, on February 15, Atlantic City Electric filed a distribution base rate case with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, seeking a revenue increase of $105 million, reflecting an ROE of 10.5%. The filing supports critical investments to enhance service and deliver safe, reliable and sustainable energy for customers through key programs, including the company's EV Smart Electric Vehicle Program, and deployment of the smart energy network program, which I will highlight later in the presentation.<br/>Because of these sustained efforts to modernize the energy grid, ACE customers experienced the most reliable energy service ever in 2022, with the lowest frequency of electric outages on record.<br/>As permitted by New Jersey Law, ACE may implement full proposed rates on November 17, subject to refund and a final order is expected in the first quarter of 2024.<br/>Next, BGE filed its second multiyear plan with the Maryland Public Service Commission on February 17, which we provided preview into on our fourth quarter earnings call. Covering the years 2024 through 2026, the multi-year plan details how BGE will invest nearly $2.3 billion annually in the electric grid and natural gas system and nearly $400 million total in electric vehicles and building efficiency programs. These investments will inject nearly $36 billion into the local economy and support an estimated 72,000 jobs as indicated in a study performed by Towson University.<br/>Importantly, BGE's infrastructure plan includes more than 300 projects and maintenance programs designed to continue meeting customers' needs and lay the foundation for the state of Maryland to reach its goal of net 0 emissions by 2045. An order is expected on the proposed plan in December of 2023. <br/>As you've noted, we also requested that the commission provided an order on the proposed reconciliation of 2021 and 2022 cost totaling $77 million of under-recovery in parallel with the order on the second multi-year plan.<br/>That brings me to Slide 8, where I want to take a moment to highlight Pepco DC's Climate Ready Pathway multiyear plans that was filed with the Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia on April 13. Pepco is requesting $190.7 million revenue increase over the 2024 to 2026 period to recover planned capital investments that are intended to enhance the reliability, resiliency and security for the local energy grid and to further support the district's goal to be carbon neutral by 2045. One of the most ambitious climate goals for the nation.<br/>Specifically, this will be done through investments in equipment and infrastructure that will enable the integration of more renewal energy, such as solar. They will also help customers access and adopt cleaner energy technologies, like electric vehicles. And they will allow Pepco to manage load to ensure the electric service customers depend on is available when they need it. Of the many maintenance programs included in Pepco's proposed multiyear plans, one involves replacing nearly 24 miles of aging power cables with newer and more modern cable so that all customers experience high quality of service and high reliability.<br/>It is the customers and communities that are at the forefront of Pepco Climate Ready Pathway plans, with a central focus on improving the social equity and advancement of affordability of electric service. As part of that commitment, the company is hoping that planned filing proposes several measures to address affordability, including expanding enrollment for the Residential Aid Discount Program to include any customer who qualified for any low-income program in the district as well as enhancing the Arrearage Management Program.<br/>Expansion of these programs would help to further extend the reach of valuable energy assistance, which in 2022 alone provided approximately 21 million to nearly 30,000 Pepco customers in D.C. or on average, $700 per customer.<br/>Pepco's low-fare plans comprehensively works to keep service affordable, foster a cleaner energy future and improve reliability, resiliency and security through significant investments. This influx of resources directed towards accommodating the next phase of D. C.'s energy transformation is expected to inject more than $580 million in the local economy and support more than 3,800 full-time jobs.<br/>An order is requested from the DC PSC by February 2024 based on a proposed 10-month procedural schedule. All our ongoing rate cases are proceeding in line with expectations, and you can find further detail on Slides 20 through 24 of the appendix.<br/>Moving to Slide 9. During the first quarter, we continued to invest capital for the benefit of our customers and are on track to meet our $7.2 billion commitment for 2023. These investments in energy infrastructure are vital to maintaining the high standards of service that we have in serving our customers, while also preparing the grid for the clean energy transformation.<br/>Today, I'm going to talk about how Atlantic City Electric is enhancing the customer experience in South Jersey through the Smart Energy Network Program, the last major initial smart meter deployment program planned for Exelon utilities. Smart meters are foundational to a smarter power grid. They enable customers to better understand real-time energy usage in homes and businesses, and they provide enhanced information to make our systems more efficient and resilient. With the broad installation beginning in September of 2022, ACE employees and their contract partners have been steadily upgrading approximately 30,000 meters per month, and all of 568,000 meters are expected to be replaced by mid-2024.<br/>When fully installed and operational, the Smart Energy Network is expected to deliver $416 million in operational and customer benefits over the next 15 years.<br/>Most notably, these benefits include the ability to restore power faster and more efficiently. And they provide tools that help customers use less energy and save money as well as the reduced need for estimated billings and the capability to provide more detailed outage information when outages occur.<br/>They also allow for better integration of new clean energy technologies, including solar, which has experienced the highest penetration in ACE's territory relative to all of our other jurisdictions at approximately 25% of net peak demand.<br/>To put a stand of benefits into perspective, on an annual basis, ACE expects to eliminate 134,000 truck rolls, reduce major store operations and cost by 10% and save $4.5 million in annual contracted meter reading costs. The Smart Energy Network is a critical step in advancing a cleaner energy future for South Jersey and helping the state meet its climate goals. Leveraging expertise from its sister utilities, ACE is committed to using its collective resources to ensure all customers realize the full benefits of this meter upgrade initiative. This is the power of Exelon platform.<br/>I was in place with a discussion on our balance sheet on Slide 10. As covered on our last earnings call, we project a 100 to 200 basis points of cushion on average over our guidance period for our consolidated corporate credit metrics above S&amp;P and Moody's downgrade thresholds of 12% over the guidance period, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. If the corporate alternative minimum tax was not mitigated through an inclusion of repairs in its calculation, we anticipate being at the lower end of that 13% to 14%. We continue to await guidance from the treasury, which we are optimistic they will issue before year-end and we remain encouraged by the engagement they have in understanding how its implementation can impact energy infrastructure providers like Exelon.<br/>From a financing perspective, we have successfully raised $2.5 billion at corporate and approximately $2 billion for ComEd and the PHI entity. To date, we have completed over 80% of our planned 2023 long-term debt financing needs. This positions us well for any unrespected market volatility in the balance of the year. We continue to see strong investor demand for our debt offerings, which is a testament to the strength of our balance sheet and to our value proposition as a premier T&amp;D utility with low-risk attributes.<br/>To reiterate our equity needs, there has been no change in our guidance to issue $425 million of equity at the holding company by 2025. We'll continue to update you as we make progress on that plan.<br/>Thank you. And I'll now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing remarks.",
			"<strong>Calvin G. Butler</strong>",
			"Thank you, Jeanne. Let me conclude our prepared remarks with a reminder of our priorities and commitments for 2023 and as the premier T&amp;D utility. It starts with operations, operating safely and reliably is our core mission, And you can count on us to focus on that every hour of every day.<br/>Secondly, as you heard from Jeanne, we have a full set of rate case proceedings well underway that will set our path for the next 3 to 4 years, given our multiyear plan frameworks. The transformation of our energy system requires a lot of coordination and alignment and we welcome the opportunities to engage with stakeholders on the most effective and efficient means to meet our jurisdictional goals.<br/>And third, we are focused on executing financially. We're looking to deploy $7.2 billion of capital this year more than ever before while maintaining earned ROEs in the 9% to 10% range and delivering on our 2023 earnings guidance range of $2.30 to $2.42 per share. We have made great progress on our financing plan for the year while also laying groundwork for future financing needs, and we continue to focus on ensuring our balance sheet is strong.<br/>Last, we continue to focus on maximizing the value we provide our customers and ensuring we are serving them in an equitable manner. As an example of how we are innovating to support a more affordable energy transformation.<br/>I'll point to BGE's recent partnership with the City of Baltimore. Specifically, BGE will share responsibility for improving the city's 700-mile conduit infrastructure, reducing the amount of city paid for maintenance capital improvements and allowing BGE to take advantage of its contracting and construction efficiencies, all while ensuring a healthy conduit system to provide more reliable and affordable power. And beyond our direct operations, we will continue to support our communities beyond providing cleaner, more reliable energy such as through our more than 75 workforce development programs across our 6 utilities. Indeed, investments like ACE's Smart Energy Network that Jeanne highlighted benefit greatly from those programs. In anticipation of this investment program, a 6-year $6.5 million job training program was established in 2018 to educate the workforce needed to fill the energy jobs of the future in New Jersey.<br/>14 of our talented employees deploying the smart meter technology are graduates of that development program established 5 years ago, and we expect to hire more than 15 additional graduates by the end of June, reinforcing our vision of facilitating an energy transformation that will stretch over generations of thoughtful planning and coordination. We look forward to building on the progress made in these first 3 months and meeting our commitments in 2023. We are delivering on course.<br/>Thank you, and we welcome your questions.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) <br/>Your first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim.",
			"<strong>Shahriar Pourreza</strong>",
			"Just if we could maybe start with Illinois. I mean, we obviously saw the trial outcome last night. I realized you guys have taken a lot of steps since 2020 to improve. But any sort of high-level read-throughs to the regulatory construct at this point or anything remaining for ComEd from a legal or even judicial standpoint?",
			"<strong>Calvin G. Butler</strong>",
			"Yes. Thank you, Shar. So first, from the start, as you know, Shar, we have cooperated fully with the investigations conducted by the government and our regulators. The deferred prosecution agreement signed in 2020 resolved the Justice Department's investigation into ComEd. But we want to be clear that we have done much more than that. We have made substantial changes to our contracting lobbying and compliance operations to ensure that the conduct that was at issue in the trial does not happen again at all levels, from my office and throughout the leaders of the organization and the 6,300 employees who keep the lights on every day in Illinois. We are committed to the highest standards of integrity and ethical behavior for our business. We have the privilege and the responsibility of roughly well over 10 million customers, and we do not take that lightly.<br/>But I want to have Jeanne spent some time talking about the other issues that have come as a result of this. And then I'm going to ask Gil, CEO of ComEd, to kind of walk through to your question, the regulatory and legislative proceedings as we move forward. Jeanne?",
			"<strong>Jeanne M. Jones</strong>",
			"Yes. Thanks, Calvin. So as Calvin mentioned, the deferred prosecution agreement and this resolved our model of the Department of Justice. But there have been a couple of things, as we've outlined in our 10-Ks and Qs that were legal matters surrounding the advanced leading (inaudible). And I'll just touch briefly on this. And again, these will all be disclosed when the Q comes out and they continue to be updated, and you'll see it when the Q comes out later today. But we did have a security suit derivatives and derivatives suits and consumer fraud suits and then there was the [FCC] investigation.<br/>So just checking through those. The security suit was filed in '19, and there's is a next court status for that, that's late in June. But based on recent developments, we have booked a probable loss in this matter of $173 million. But that is expected to be fully recovered by insurance. So there is no earnings or cash impact from that. There are 3 derivatives suits pending, including one filed in '21, and there were a couple of new ones filed in April and May of this year. They all assert similar claims, and there's no update from a financial perspective on those. But I would remind you that, that one is a little bit different than that, any amount recovered were resovled in cash reciept to the company and those types of lawsuits.<br/>And then there were 3 consumer fraud cases filed, 2 of which have been dismissed, and we just argued our motion to dismiss the remaining case in late April.<br/>And then lastly, the FCC investigation continues, we continue to cooperate fully, but no update on that. And so that's just kind of the status update. But again, we give kind of the play-by-play in the Q for those.<br/>And so maybe I'll turn it over to Gil to talk through the multiyear plan.",
			"<strong>Gil C. Quiniones</strong>",
			"Our proposed grid modernization plan and multiyear rate plan support and its in 100% alignment with the goals of the Climate Equitable Jobs Act and the Illinois Energy and Environmental Policy goals of an orderly and equitable energy transition here in our state. It is a product of extensive stakeholder process with multiple parties over the past couple of years. As you know, we filed our proposed rate case in January of this year and we look forward to continue working with all parties openly and collaboratively. As Jeanne mentioned before, the intervenors are scheduled to file their testimony this month. Hearings will be in August and the order in December of this year.",
			"<strong>Calvin G. Butler</strong>",
			"So Shar, we're on course, and I appreciate that question.",
			"<strong>Shahriar Pourreza</strong>",
			"Perfect. And then just lastly, Maryland, obviously, Calvin set a pretty aggressive offshore wind target last month, 8.5 gigs by '31. I guess as we look at the plan today, could we see incremental transmission opportunities at Delmarva, I guess, put differently, what do you embed in plan at this point?",
			"<strong>Calvin G. Butler</strong>",
			"So if I can, what you're asking is that from Maryland's offshore legislation that they just recently passed, could that have a spillover that's happening along in Delmarva. Is that the question there, Shar?",
			"<strong>Shahriar Pourreza</strong>",
			"Perfect. And as we're thinking about transmission opportunities, yes. correct.",
			"<strong>Calvin G. Butler</strong>",
			"Yes. I think, first and foremost, Shar, the legislation does present an opportunity for Exelon to participate in transmission. The amended legislation, as you know, requires that PJM conduct a study of the transmission system and taking a more holistic approach with that but it will look nice about it, it will prioritize leveraging existing infrastructure, permitting risks and grid challenges, use of open access of collective transmission systems and avoiding any single contingency items. So this all goes to how Exelon can differentiate itself from others. And as you know, the state has a goal of reaching 8,500 megawatts of offshore wind energy capacity by 2031, and I think we are well positioned to be a part of that. And I have David Velazquez next to me, who oversees our transmission. David, is there anything to add there?",
			"<strong>David M. Velazquez</strong>",
			"Sure, just to add -- yes, we do think that they're potential for incremental opportunities on transmission there. We've not included anything in the current plan for opportunities that are there. And the way the legislation reads by the beginning of July in 2025, the PSC or the -- the PSC will direct PJM to issue kind of a competitive transmission solicitation for the transmission that's needed to support the offshore wind.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from the line of Paul Zimbardo from Bank of America.",
			"<strong>Paul Andrew Zimbardo</strong>",
			"Great. If you could -- could you discuss the O&amp;M savings drivers you mentioned in the script and just at what segments you're expected to realize the offsets for unfavorable weather. I think you said across the platform, it sounds broader than, I believe is PECO and Pepco where the impacts were from weather?",
			"<strong>Jeanne M. Jones</strong>",
			"Yes. I'll hit on it and then Calvin feel free to add, too. So when you think about the $0.05, it's a combination of levers. And I'll start with what we did to sort of enter this year in a conservative and substantial matter. So we -- you may remember, we had the weather and storm favorability last year, and we did some derisking at the end of the year to help us in '23 and beyond. And so that's helpful heading into the year.<br/>Second, as you think about where other volatility lies and interest rate exposure, we really mitigated that risk by having completed our sole corporate financing in the first quarter. So locking that in. And you can see that in the sensitivities in our exact. We have no exposure really on that. And then as you talked about, right, we do have leverage across the business. It would be more focused on areas that hit the bottom line, but then remember at the corporate entity, dollar-saved filter down to all the areas as well. And so it'ill be a combination across the platform.<br/>In addition to that, as I mentioned, we do see some favorable depreciation at PECO relative to expectations.<br/>And then finally, we had if you think about the $0.05 in totality, we had $0.01 of the favorability from the carbon mitigation credit deposit rate on that reg asset on a full year basis, that's probably going to be about $0.03. So when you put all that together, clear line of sights offsetting the $0.05 and feeling good about the rest of the year and delivering in the range at midpoint or better.",
			"<strong>Paul Andrew Zimbardo</strong>",
			"Okay. Excellent. And then changing topics. I saw (technical difficulty) the same opportunity. Could you quantify how much that could be and just confirming if there's any offset to rate base, those kind of items are factored into the plan?",
			"<strong>Calvin G. Butler</strong>",
			"Shar, you cut out midway through your question. Would you mind repeating that, please? I mean, Paul.",
			"<strong>Paul Andrew Zimbardo</strong>",
			"Sure. I was asking about the IIJA, the Infrastructure and Jobs Act just I saw that headline during the quarter. If you could quantify what the opportunity could be for Exelon. And just if there are any offsets to rate base from kind of federal financing if that's incorporated in the plan today?",
			"<strong>Jeanne M. Jones</strong>",
			"Yes.",
			"<strong>Calvin G. Butler</strong>",
			"I'll let Jeanne take that, and then we'll go from there, please.",
			"<strong>Jeanne M. Jones</strong>",
			"Yes. Thanks, Calvin. So the $700 million is what we've applied for. So it's a really competitive process. So it's hard to estimate what portion of that we'll get. But what I can tell you is we haven't factored it in. So it's the -- we're not expecting any meaningful impact to rate base to finance the needs, we're reaffirming everything. And then we'll continue to update that -- update you on that as that progresses.",
			"<strong>Calvin G. Butler</strong>",
			"And I would just add, Paul, understanding as we said before the IIJA and the IRA create tremendous opportunity for us as Exelon utilities, specifically to partner with our jurisdictions and drive this energy transition faster. And it also goes to the affordability factor of what we do and how we do within our jurisdictions. So we're working it hard, and we're partnering and looking for all the opportunities to really increase in our investments, but more importantly, partner with our communities in this endeavor.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe.",
			"<strong>Steven Isaac Fleishman</strong>",
			"Calvin. So just on the Illinois, I guess, we're going to get the recommendation soon on the multiyear, the new framework. So obviously, things like capital structure and ROEs and I assume rate base are the key variables. Are there any other -- and then, I guess, maybe incentives. Are those kind of the key issues to monitor in the recommendations or any other things that we should be watching for?",
			"<strong>Calvin G. Butler</strong>",
			"Yes. Thank you. I'll let Gil take that in because he's been intimately involved in the process. Gil?",
			"<strong>Gil C. Quiniones</strong>",
			"I think you pretty much captured those are the items that we anticipate parties are going to be interested in.",
			"<strong>Steven Isaac Fleishman</strong>",
			"Okay. And then I do -- I think there was a minimum capital structure allowed under the bill. Is that still kind of through the 50%?",
			"<strong>Gil C. Quiniones</strong>",
			"Yes, I'd say harbor at 50%.",
			"<strong>Steven Isaac Fleishman</strong>",
			"Okay. And the -- I guess my other question, the carrying charge or recovery on the CMC deferral. This is just CMC costs that you're not yet recovering in rates that you're earning a carrying charge on?",
			"<strong>Jeanne M. Jones</strong>",
			"That's right. Yes. It's -- it earns a customer deposit rate, which was 0 in '22 and then was reset at the 5% at the end of last year, early part of this year. And so outside relative to expectations for this year. But that reg asset is expected to be collected and wind down by May of '24. So it's not a future years earnings, but it is helpful this year.",
			"<strong>Steven Isaac Fleishman</strong>",
			"Okay. And then finally, on the IRS implementation of IRA and the minimum tax. Is there any -- has there been any developments or sense of outcome there, I guess, on the, I guess, particularly the repair tax issue or just kind of sitting and waiting?",
			"<strong>Jeanne M. Jones</strong>",
			"Yes, same status. So still, about $200 million per year. We -- that's all reflected in our guidance and our first -- from an earnings and a credit metric forecast and we give you kind of the sensitivity of where we'll be, if it isn't alleviated and where it will be, if it is. Still, optimistic we get regulations by the end of the year and still ongoing discussions with us, EEI, the industry and treasury on the repair deduction and in general, how the corporate alternative minimum impact energy providers like Exelon. And some further dialogue recently, I would say about why the utility industry is different given the capital-intensive nature of our business. And so just ongoing dialects, but no new changes to the assumptions or estimates.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley.",
			"<strong>David Keith Arcaro</strong>",
			"There's a new Chair in Illinois. I was just wondering if you have had any initial dialogue or perspectives that you might offer on how it might be to work together with the ICC going forward, especially given that it's such a busy regulatory year.",
			"<strong>Calvin G. Butler</strong>",
			"Yes. David, thank you for the question. I think as I said in my opening comments, the transition of leadership and commissioners is part of the process. And so we are really engaging with all stakeholders in a very collaborative process as we move forward.<br/>But directly to your question, the Governor Pritzker did accept the resignation of Chair Zalewski and has nominated the incoming for Doug Scott, who, as you know, used to be the former Chair of the commission and was very instrumental in the tracking and creating of the Climate Equitable and Jobs Act. And there has been communication, but the communications have been around moving the state's goals forward. And we have heard nothing to date that is taking that are derailing those efforts. And as Gil alluded to earlier in Jeanne, we're still expecting a final order on ComEd for your multiyear plan by December 20. So also along with the new Chair, they're getting a couple of new commissioners. And again, that process continues to move forward.",
			"<strong>David Keith Arcaro</strong>",
			"Okay. Great. And I was also wondering, with the ComEd and BGE reconciliations. I was -- I just wanted to check. Do those -- do there tend to be big swing factors in those regulatory processes? Or are they pretty standardized just in terms of what costs fit in? And are they smooth recovery processes typically?",
			"<strong>Jeanne M. Jones</strong>",
			"Yes. So on the -- on ComEd, the reconciliation they filed is for the 2022 -- -- under the 2022 formula rate. So this is a reconciliation that has been going on for 10 years. So I think that, that one is a little bit more straightforward. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, part of that is just the cash collection of the true-up on the treasury rate. Under the formula rate, you set the rate based on prior year treasuries and then you can recognize it in earnings, but then you true it up in rates later. So that one's pretty standard in the sense that it's been going on and it's sort of clear.<br/>The BGE one, though, is the first reconciliation and a multiyear plan in Maryland. And so this will be the first time we're going through it. But there's a framework there to work through. And so that's -- but that order will come in December of this year as well. And I think it's important for this year, but I think it's really important in terms of kind of what you mentioned, right, setting the precedent going forward so that we know what is recoverable, what's not. And you get into a place where you can say, okay, if there's a variance here, I can put up a receivable or reg asset or conversely, if we do well, we put up a liability and we'll get that back to customers. So I think going through that will be helpful as it has been, we've seen in ComEd, once you get through it the first time, it's very helpful going forward.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question will be the last one coming from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan Securities LLC.",
			"<strong>Jeremy Bryan Tonet</strong>",
			"Just wanted to dial into Maryland, a little bit more if we could. We've seen changes in the commission and there are these kind of policy goals out there. Just wondering how you see that effect in BGE, both the electric and gas side? Or is that kind of offsetting over time? Or just wondering, updated thoughts about the future of gas there and how that impacts Exelon?",
			"<strong>Calvin G. Butler</strong>",
			"Yes. So great question. And with me in the room, I have Carim Khouzami, who's the CEO of BGE. But let me take the initial piece, and then I'll turn it over to Carim to see if he has any additional information.<br/>So just like Illinois, Jeremy, we're having a transition of a Chair of our commission as well as a couple of Governor Moore appointees. Governor Moore has taken a very aggressive position to continue to push decarbonization and transportation electrification throughout the state of Maryland, really rivaling it with California and Illinois in the like of moving forward.<br/>Having said that, there is an alignment with the jurisdictional goals of what BGE is doing as well as Pepco Maryl. The gas portfolio within our business is, we believe, is critical to the long-term decarbonization of the industry as we are going through the process of replacing the gas infrastructure within Maryland, we continue to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in that effort and we've attacked it as a portfolio approach because reliability of the system and affordability for our customers is critical in our endeavors. So we have communicated that with the state. BGE has been very involved in those conversations, and I'll let Carim just take us a step further.",
			"<strong>Carim V. Khouzami</strong>",
			"Thank you, Calvin, I think you hit all good points. One of the key points to highlight is in last year's legislative session in the Climate Solution Now Act, which set forth state goals for us to achieve as is economy-wide laid out a number of working groups where they would determine what is the right path for Maryland going forward. BGE and the other Maryland utilities are at the table with all the other interested parties, and we're working through those issues now, and that will be including at the end of this year with recommendations.<br/>As Calvin mentioned, there are a number of ways to get to the state goals. We see the pathway that is the most affordable, reliable and resilient as being one that still includes gas as part of the infrastructure. And we're working with the groups to kind of talk through what is the right path forward for Maryland, and we do have confidence that gas will be part of the future.",
			"<strong>Jeremy Bryan Tonet</strong>",
			"Got it. That's very helpful there. And then just pivoting to results and just a smaller question overall, but I was hoping you could illuminate a little bit of color on the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations there as far as the change in environmental liabilities and the change in FERC liability. Just a little bit more color on what those items were.",
			"<strong>Calvin G. Butler</strong>",
			"Sure.",
			"<strong>Jeanne M. Jones</strong>",
			"Yes, sure. So on the environmental liabilities, that's the PHI is the legacy issue where we continue to update estimates for remediation of that. So we just slightly increased the reserve there. On the ComEd item, ComEd and on the FERC had an audit began in '21. We got draft findings earlier this year. And just based on ongoing discussions, we booked about $15 million of a probable loss. So that's ongoing. But that's kind of the nature of the 2 and they're infrequent unusual, as we carve them out from an operating perspective.",
			"<strong>Calvin G. Butler</strong>",
			"I think that was the last question?",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Yes, that was the last question and at this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Calvin Butler for closing remarks.",
			"<strong>Calvin G. Butler</strong>",
			"Thank you, Gigi. And I just want to take a moment to say thank you for joining us today. I appreciate your engagement and all your questions. And with that, it concludes the call. Have a great day.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Thanks to all our participants for joining us today. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day."

Results for the first quarter of 2022 included transaction- and transition-related charges of $0.02 per share. Results for the first quarter of 2023 reflect the impact of rate design changes for Eversource’s Massachusetts electric business that were effective with the implementation of new rates on January 1, 2023, and are having the effect of shifting certain peak demand revenues from the summer period to winter periods.",
			"Also today, the Eversource Energy Board of Trustees approved a common dividend of $0.675 per share, payable June 30, 2023, to shareholders of record as of May 18, 2023.",
			"\"Our employees overcame some challenging weather conditions in March due to a number of late winter storms,\" said Joe Nolan, Eversource Energy chairman, president and chief executive officer. \"But overall, New England experienced a very mild winter this year, which benefited our customers in two important ways. The mild weather lowered energy consumption and lower consumption across much of the country helped spur a decline in energy prices, which will significantly reduce electricity and natural gas supply rates as we move through 2023. This is excellent news for our customers who experienced unprecedented spikes in their energy rates at the end of 2022.\"",

			"Eversource Energy’s transmission segment earned $155.1 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared with earnings of $148.5 million in the first quarter of 2022. Higher transmission earnings were primarily due to a higher level of investment in Eversource’s electric transmission system.",
			"<span>Electric Distribution</span>",
			"Eversource Energy’s electric distribution segment earned $165.5 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared with $140.9 million in the first quarter of 2022.

			"<i><sup>1 </sup></i><i>All per-share amounts in this news release are reported on a diluted basis. The only common equity securities that are publicly traded are common shares of Eversource Energy. The earnings and EPS of each business do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities of such business, but rather represent a direct interest in Eversource Energy's assets and liabilities as a whole. EPS by business is a financial measure that is not recognized under generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP) and is calculated by dividing the net income or loss attributable to common shareholders of each business by the weighted average diluted Eversource Energy common shares outstanding for the period. Earnings discussions also include non-GAAP financial measures referencing earnings and EPS excluding certain transaction and transition costs. Eversource Energy uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results by business and to more fully compare and explain results without including these items. This information is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating performance and planning and forecasting of future periods. Management believes the impacts of transaction and transition costs are not indicative of Eversource Energy’s ongoing costs and performance. Management views these charges as not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business and therefore not an indicator of baseline operating performance. Due to the nature and significance of the effect of these items on net income attributable to common shareholders and EPS, management believes that the non-GAAP presentation is a more meaningful representation of Eversource Energy’s financial performance and provides additional and useful information to readers in analyzing historical and future performance of the business. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to Eversource Energy’s reported net income attributable to common shareholders or EPS determined in accordance with GAAP as indicators of Eversource Energy’s operating performance.</i>",

			"While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).",
			"Over half a decade, Sempra Energy managed to grow its earnings per share at 42% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 8% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.",
			"You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).",

			"When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between <em>total shareholder return</em> (TSR) and <em>share price return</em>. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Sempra Energy the TSR over the last 5 years was 69%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!",
			"While it's never nice to take a loss, Sempra Energy shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 1.7% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 2.6%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 11% for each year. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Sempra Energy better, we need to consider many other factors.

			"Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Entergy Corporation (<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:NYSE:ETR;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nyse-etr/entergy?blueprint=2491280&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=intro&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NYSE:ETR</a>) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.",
			"We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Simply Wall St analysis model;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://github.com/SimplyWallSt/Company-Analysis-Model/blob/master/MODEL.markdown#discounted-cash-flow-dcf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Simply Wall St analysis model</a>.",

			"As Entergy operates in the electric utilities sector, we need to calculate the intrinsic value slightly differently. In this approach dividends per share (DPS) are used, as free cash flow is difficult to estimate and often not reported by analysts. This often underestimates the value of a stock, but it can still be good as a comparison to competitors. The 'Gordon Growth Model' is used, which simply assumes that dividend payments will continue to increase at a sustainable growth rate forever. The dividend is expected to grow at an annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We then discount this figure to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.8%. Relative to the current share price of US$106, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.",
			"Value Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)",
			"= US$4.7 / (6.8% – 2.1%)",
			"= US$98.7",
			"The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Entergy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.",
			"<strong>Strength</strong>",
			"<strong>Weakness</strong>",
			"<strong>Opportunity</strong>",
			"<strong>Threat</strong>",
			"Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Entergy, we've put together three essential aspects you should further research:",

			"The new sites are part of the company's community solar program portfolio, Clean Energy Connection, and add to Duke Energy's continued commitment in expanding its renewable resources and providing clean, reliable and affordable energy to program subscribers.",
			"At peak output, each site will generate enough carbon-free electricity to power what would be equivalent to around 23,000 homes.",
			"The projects employed around 200-300 workers during construction. Along with indirect economic benefits that accompany solar project development, such as increased local spending, the new facilities will also have a positive economic impact on the local community by providing significant tax revenues to the counties they operate in.",

			"<b>How the program works</b>",
			"Through the Clean Energy Connection program, Duke Energy Florida customers can subscribe to solar power and earn credits toward their electricity bills without having to install or maintain their own equipment.",
			"Customers subscribe to a portion of solar energy from the company's Clean Energy Connection solar generation portfolio. The monthly subscription fee will help pay for the cost of construction and operation of the company's solar generators at its renewable energy centers and is conveniently added to a customer's regular electric bill. Customers also receive a corresponding subscription credit on their bill that is tied to their share of the renewable energy produced by the solar centers in a given month. The credit is determined by multiplying the customer's share of renewable energy by a subscription credit rate, which escalates over a customer's committed subscription duration.",
			"Enrolled income-qualified customers will receive immediate bill savings, as monthly credits will always be greater than the program fees. Current participation in any of these or related programs can be used to qualify: Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), SNAP-EBT, Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), and Duke Energy Neighborhood Energy Saver.",

A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved. <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Our risks dashboard;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/utilities/tsx-fts/fortis-shares?blueprint=2491185&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=conclusion&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Our risks dashboard</a> should have the 2 risks we have identified for Fortis.",
			"Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.",
			"It's worth noting the high use of debt by Fortis, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.25. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.",
			"Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.",
			"But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings.

			"Dividend investing is an investment strategy that focuses on investing in companies that pay dividends to their shareholders. Dividends are a portion of a company's profits that are distributed to its shareholders in the form of cash payments or additional shares of stock. One of the main goals for dividend investing is to generate stable income for shareholders and to benefit from potential long-term capital appreciation of the stock.",
			"When investing in dividend stocks, investors often pay attention to companies that have raised their payouts over the long haul. Moreover, these companies perform better during periods of economic downturns because of their stable cash flows and solid balance sheets. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:CVX;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/chevron%20corp/93410/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVX</a>), Medtronic plc (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:MDT;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/medtronic%20plc/1613103/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MDT</a>), NextEra Energy, Inc.

			"Though dividend investing can be a conservative approach, it can help investors create long-term wealth if done properly. For this reason, we have compiled a list of 25 things every dividend investor should know.",

			"Dividends have significantly contributed to market returns over the years. According to a report by <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Hartford Funds;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.hartfordfunds.com/dam/en/docs/pub/whitepapers/WP106.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hartford Funds</a>, dividend income has accounted for 41% of the S&amp;P 500's total return on average from 1930 to 2022. The report also highlighted that from 2000 to 2009, the S&amp;P 500 delivered a negative return to shareholders mainly due to the dot-com bubble burst in March 2000. However, dividends provided a 1.8% annualized return during this decade.",
			"Dividend stocks have delivered a solid performance in the past, outperforming their non-dividend counterparts in terms of total returns. <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Hartford Funds;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.hartfordfunds.com/dam/en/docs/pub/whitepapers/WP106.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hartford Funds</a> reported that dividend payers delivered an average annual return of 9.18% from 1973 to 2022, compared with a negative 0.60% return of the non-dividend payers. During the same period, the S&amp;P 500 index returned 7.68%.",
			"Last year's continuous interest rate hikes and growing inflation caused the stock market to report its worst year since the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. The S&amp;P 500 declined by over 18% in 2022, compared with a less harsh drop of 7.6% in the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Payers. During the year, the S&amp;P 500 Non-Dividend Payers fell by 21.1%, significantly underperforming dividend stocks.",
			"Another report by <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Fidelity Investments;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/inflation-and-dividend-stocks\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fidelity Investments</a> revealed that the performance of dividend cutters and eliminators was not up to par historically. These securities underperformed the market by 20% to 25% during the year leading up to the cut.",
			"Dividend stocks are defensive in nature and can provide a hedge against inflation. Dividend payments from companies tend to increase over time and can potentially keep pace with rising prices. According to a report by <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Fidelity Investments;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/inflation-and-dividend-stocks\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fidelity Investments</a>, dividends represented over 54% of the market's returns during decades when inflation was high. The report further mentioned that during the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, dividends represented 67%, 44%, and 73% of the market's returns, respectively. During these decades, inflation averaged above 5% and total returns were lower than 10%.",
			"Not only did dividend stocks deliver solid returns during high inflationary periods, but the dividend growth of the companies also outpaced inflation over the years. From 1971 to 2021, dividends paid by companies in the US have grown by 3.7% per year, compared with a 2% growth in inflation per year, as reported by <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:BlackRock;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/ca/investors/en/market-insights/dividend-growth-and-inflation\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BlackRock</a>.

The report mentioned that the S&amp;P 500 dividends have grown by 5.73% from 1957 to 2022, compared with a 3.68% growth in inflation during the same period.",
			"This suggests that dividend payments have grown at a faster pace than inflation, which can help to maintain the purchasing power of the income generated by dividend-paying stocks. <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:The Vanguard Group;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.vanguard.co.uk/professional/insights-education/insights/dividends-and-the-long-term-benefits-of-diversification\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Vanguard Group</a>, an American investment management company, also reported that the US dividend growth has surpassed inflation by five percentage points over the 20 years ending October 30, 2022, and by 2.1 percentage points over 100 years.",
			"Dividend stocks are comparatively less volatile than other equity investments. When investors receive a dividend payment from a company, it provides a positive return on their investment, regardless of whether the stock price is rising or falling. This can help to reduce the overall volatility of the investment, as the dividend payment can offset any decline in the stock price. According to a report by <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Wisdom Tree;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.wisdomtree.com/-/media/us-media-files/documents/resource-library/presentations/dividend_monitor_presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wisdom Tree</a>, in the last 64 years, dividend levels declined in only six of those years, whereas stock prices fell in 18 of those years in comparison. The report mentioned that stock prices were over two times more volatile than their underlying dividend cash flows.",
			"The dividend payout ratio is the percentage of a company's earnings that are paid out in dividends. A high payout ratio may indicate that a company is paying out more than it can afford, while a low payout ratio may indicate that a company is retaining more earnings for future growth. According to analysts, the dividend payout ratio of between 35% to 55% is considered healthy as it shows that the company has enough money left over to reinvest for growth.",
			"<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Hartford Funds;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.hartfordfunds.com/dam/en/docs/pub/whitepapers/WP106.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hartford Funds</a> analyzed the dividend payout ratio of dividend stocks within the Russell 1000 by dividing them into five quintiles. The study found that companies paying the highest level of dividends have not performed well as those with moderate payouts and yields. This group of dividends had an average payout ratio of 40% from 1979 to 2022 and also beat the market by 78% during the same period.",
			"High-yield dividend stocks can be more volatile as these stocks may be more sensitive to changes in interest rates and market conditions, which can impact the value of the stock. According to a report by <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:AllianceBernstein;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.alliancebernstein.com/corporate/en/insights/investment-insights/equity-income-the-dividend-defense-against-inflation.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AllianceBernstein</a>, the MSCI USA High Dividend Yield Index Index, and the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index underperformed the broader market in over seven of the last ten years through 2021.",
			"According to analysts, dividend yields between 3% to 6% are considered healthy as they can provide a reasonable level of income for investors. However, it is not the same with all high-yield dividend stocks. For instance, in some industries, such as utilities and real estate investment trusts (REITs), higher dividend yields may be more common and considered healthy due to the nature of the business model and the need to generate consistent income for shareholders. Investors should always look for the respective company's business model and dividend sustainability to make investment decisions. For example, companies like Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:MO;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/altria%20group%20inc/764180/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MO</a>), Verizon Communications Inc.

Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), and The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) are some popular dividend aristocrats. These companies become top choices for investors because of their financial strength, stability, and commitment to returning value to shareholders.

			"Yes, the dividend growth rate is a crucial factor in dividend investing, as it reflects a company's ability to increase its dividend payouts to shareholders over time. Companies that are able to consistently grow their dividend payments at a healthy rate are often considered to be strong and stable investments, as this indicates that they have a strong and growing cash flow and are committed to returning value to their shareholders.

Dividend growers often have strong and growing cash flows.

Some examples of dividend growers are Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), and The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW).",

The goal of this strategy is to capture the dividend payment while minimizing exposure to the stock's price movements. The ex-dividend date is the day on which a stock begins trading without the dividend payment included in its price. Investors who own the stock on or before the ex-dividend date are entitled to receive the dividend payment.",
			"Dividend-paying stocks can be found across a variety of sectors, including but not limited to utilities, consumer staples, healthcare, financials, and technology. Companies from different sectors may have varying dividend policies, payout ratios, and growth rates, depending on their industry dynamics and business models. For example, utility companies are often viewed as stable dividend-paying stocks due to their predictable cash flows and regulated business models.",
			"Similarly, energy companies also pay strong dividends to shareholders and have grown their dividends steadily in recent years. <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Morningstar;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1147626/4-energy-stocks-with-fast-growing-dividends\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Morningstar</a> reported that dividends in the energy sector have grown by  401% since 2018, compared with an 86% dividend growth in the rest of the US market.

			"Dividend ETFs typically invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks across various sectors and industries, providing investors with exposure to a broad range of companies and reducing the risk of concentrated exposure to a single stock or sector.

			"Dividends are not completely immune to market downturns, as companies may experience declines in earnings and cash flows during economic recessions or periods of market volatility. In such environments, companies may face pressure to cut or suspend their dividends to preserve cash and maintain financial stability. The most recent example of such a phenomenon was seen during the recent pandemic of 2020. During the year, nearly 190 US-listed companies stopped paying dividends and 33% of them hadn't restored their dividends, as of December 31, 2022.

If approved by the Public Service Commission of <span class=\"xn-location\">South Carolina</span> (PSCSC), the average monthly residential bill would increase by 3.7% beginning <span class=\"xn-chron\">Aug. 1</span>.",

			"If approved by the PSCSC, rates for commercial customers would increase 2.0% and rates for industrial customers would increase 2.7%.",
			"The PSCSC will consider the rates in a public evidentiary hearing where it will also hear the results of an extensive audit and inquiries of the parties involved in the case to ensure an accurate adjustment is made to billed rates.",
			"Energy providers across the country have been impacted by a sharp rise in fuel costs over the past couple of years.The company does not profit from these increased fuel costs and proactively takes measures to insulate customers from volatility. For example, Duke Energy Progress achieved <span class=\"xn-money\">$38 million</span> in savings for <span class=\"xn-location\">South Carolina</span> customers by aggressively managing natural gas fuel contracts to obtain the best price, significantly reducing the overall rate impact for customers. Also, carbon-free nuclear, which provides about half of <span class=\"xn-location\">South Carolina's</span> generation, and renewables, which provide fuel-free energy, help mitigate fuel volatility.",

The fuel rate is based on the projected cost of fuel used to provide electric service to the company's customers, plus a true up of the prior year's projection compared to actual costs incurred. The PSCSC reviews fuel costs and adjusts the fuel component of customer rates accordingly.",
			"Each year, this true-up proceeding is intended to resolve the difference between projected fuel costs, and what is actually billed to the customer. Some years, the company reimburses customers and reduces the charge to their energy bills; in other years – like this year – the shortfall from the underpayment is recovered from customers.",
			"The increase for all customer classes in this year's request is primarily driven by the increased cost of natural gas caused by national and international demand and tight supplies, plus the true-up component since the previous fuel cost-recovery filing. In other words, customers have paid far less than what it actually cost to power their homes and businesses, and Duke Energy Progress has financed this difference on behalf of customers.

Please go ahead, ma'am.",
			"<strong>Joanna Park</strong>",
			"Welcome to California Resources Corporation's First Quarter 2023 Conference Call. Participating on today's call are Francisco Leon, President and Chief Executive Officer as well as the entire Executive Committee. I'd like to highlight that we have provided slides on our Investor Relations section of our website, www.crc.com. These slides provide additional information into our operations and our first quarter results. <br/>We've also provided information reconciling non-GAAP financial measures discussed to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures on our website as well as in our earnings release. Today, we are making some forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results could differ due to risk factors described in our earnings release and in our periodic SEC filings. (Operator Instructions)<br/>With that, I will now turn the call over to Francisco.",
			"<strong>Francisco J. Leon</strong>",
			"Thank you, Joanna. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I am very pleased to be here talking to you today as CEO of CRC as we continued to build a different kind of energy company, focused on generating the highest cash flow from our low-carbon intensity assets and advancing our carbon management business. <br/>My remarks today will focus on 3 key areas: First, our record financial performance in the quarter, which was driven by a strong operational execution and leading natural gas position; second, the progress we made advancing our plans to reposition the business to unlock shareholder value. And finally, the growing strength of our carbon management business as we continue to take steps to enable California's clean energy goals.<br/>Turning to our quarterly results. We're off to a great start for the year. Record financial results showcased the quality of our low-decline assets and the benefit of a diverse hydrocarbon E&amp;P portfolio. We successfully maintained flat oil production quarter-over-quarter on $31 million of drilling and completions and workover capital.<br/>We drilled 9 wells in 2 sidetracks and ended the quarter with 1 drilling rig at Wilmington and 39 maintenance rigs. Our resource offers stack pace, which means we can recomplete and sidetrack existing wells to add pay at attractive returns. This type of activity is highly economic and allows us to bring on production at a fraction of the cost of a new well. For the balance of the year, we intend to increase our workover activity and execute a 1-rig drilling program. We have secured all the necessary drilling permits for our 2023 capital program and are working to build incremental permit inventory for next year.<br/>Another highlight of the first quarter was the California commodity markets, because the state operates as an energy island, California realizations reflect the demand for energy and tends to be higher than national benchmarks. Both NGLs and natural gas realizations were above expectations and crude realizations were within guidance. To be more specific, NGL and natural gas realizations benefited from colder-than-normal weather and the lack of in-state production. In the case of natural gas, our realizations for Q1 were approximately 630% of NYMEX.<br/>As a reminder, California imports approximately 90% of the natural gas consumed in the state. When demand exceeds local production plus incoming supply, the market relies upon natural gas in storage to make up the difference. In the case of January and to some degree, February, California found itself with limited natural gas inventories in storage and limited local supply of production. As the state's largest natural gas producer, our roughly 12 Bcf of production was available to meet the needs of the state.<br/>These factors helped drive record results and facilitated another quarter of shareholder returns. The company generated pretax free cash flow of $263 million, of which approximately $79 million was returned to shareholders. This consisted of $20 million in dividends and $59 million in share repurchases. Since implementation of our share repurchase program in May of 2021, we have bought back approximately 15% of the company's outstanding shares. Combined with our fixed dividend of $1.13 per share, we have returned back to shareholders approximately 22% of our current market cap in less than 2 years.<br/>We intend to continue with our active shareholder program and have $567 million remaining under the total Board approved $1.1 million authorization. We also ended the quarter with robust liquidity of $931 million, including $477 million of cash on hand. CRC is committed to maintaining a very strong financial foundation. And we will continue our focus on achieving greater financial flexibility and commitment to shareholder returns.<br/>As we look to the balance of the year, we have increased our 2023 after-tax free cash flow guidance by 8% to $415 million at the midpoint of our range to reflect our strong first quarter '23 performance. This is partially offset by lower commodity pricing assumptions for the rest of the year, timing of capital changes to working capital and higher cash taxes. We have provided detailed analysis about our quarterly financial and operational results and our 2023 guidance in the attachments to our earnings release and in our slide deck.<br/>Turning to our continued strategic realignment of the company's operations and structure, we announced yesterday the appointment of Nelly Molina as CRC's new CFO, effective May 8. I could not be more excited to welcome Nelly to CRC. She is a seasoned energy executive with more than 25 years of corporate finance, capital markets and project financing experience and brings some extensive background in the development of energy infrastructure projects in the natural gas and power sectors.<br/>Nelly joins us from Sempra Energy, where she most recently served as Vice President of Audit Services and Vice President of Investor Relations. I look forward to introducing her to you in the weeks and months ahead. And I know we will benefit greatly from her expertise in navigating today's evolving energy industry.<br/>In addition to the changes in leadership, we are also focused on pursuing operational excellence. As mentioned last quarter, we launched a cost reduction and business transformation initiative to align with our activity levels and build a more efficient organization. We are targeting annualized run rate cost reduction goal of $25 million to $50 million to be implemented by the end of this year. We have identified $20 million of reductions to date and are working to expand the scope and scale of cost reduction efforts during Q2.<br/>Another key element of our plan is to achieve increased financial flexibility. This quarter, we have successfully reaffirmed our $1.2 billion borrowing base and amended our RBL facility to increase the duration and improve the terms. These changes will enable us to make additional investments in our carbon management business and further support our shareholder return program as well as help pave the way for a potential separation of the carbon management business.<br/>We will continue to evaluate ways to increase our financial flexibility as the year progresses. As we discussed last quarter, we're evaluating the separation of our carbon management business, Carbon TerraVault as part of our ongoing efforts to optimize the value of our portfolio.<br/>Outgoing CRC CEO, Mac McFarland is serving as the Chair of the Board of Carbon TerraVault. And we have been working closely together to determine the best path forward. The carbon management business is still in the early stages. And there are important milestones that we're working to reach before initiating a potential separation, such as an EPA Class VI permit approval, project FID, line of sight to first CO2 injection and first cash flow, among others.<br/>We're continuing to build out the leading carbon storage business in California. In the first quarter, we have made further progress by signing 2 new Greenfield storage-only CDMAs, a green hydrogen project in the sacramentation and a renewable DME project at our Elk Hills net 0 industrial park. These projects target 140,000 metric tons of CO2 injection per annum on a combined basis.<br/>We now have 4 CDMAs in place for a combined injection rate of 610,000 metric tons per year, representing reservations of about 12% of our port space. Further, we submitted Class VI permit application for a new development area, which we call CTV IV for an additional 34 million metric tons, bringing CTV's total potential permitted storage to 174 million metric tons or over 85% of our stated 2027 target of 200 million metric tons. The CTV team continues to file permits for additional vaults across California to expand our leading position in the state. We are targeting receiving our first Class VI draft permit from the EPA for CTV I by the end of the year.<br/>In summary, we're excited about our continued progress in executing our strategic repositioning. In the first quarter of 2023, we had record financial performance, which allowed us to increase our full year guidance. We also advanced our cost-cutting initiatives and continued to reposition our business to unlock additional shareholder value. And finally, we further expanded our California leading carbon management strategy to support California's clean energy goals. Thank you for joining us on the call today.<br/>We'll now open the line for questions. Operator?",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) And the first question comes from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.",
			"<strong>Scott Michael Hanold</strong>",
			"And my first question, it may feel like a little bit of a multifaceted one, but let me try here. You've made progress on, obviously, starting to, signing up the new CDMAs. And how do you -- and more of those, I guess, recently were some of the lower capital intensity agreements? <br/>And how do you think about the mix of these projects going forward. Do you want to see some more of the kind of the front-to-end projects to increase the scale of EBITDA? Or do you feel confident and I know you said you're only about 12% on total reservations right now.<br/>But do you feel confident in the larger quantum of getting that storage permitted. So that scarcity factor isn't really as much of a concern. So I know it's kind of a bit of a multifaceted question. But ultimately, I'm just trying to think about the higher relative EBITDA opportunity. And if a potential offset would be exercising some of the equity stake options.",
			"<strong>Jay A. Bys</strong>",
			"Scott, yes, we're focused on both. So Greenfield 4 CDMAs on Greenfield is really good progress. No question about that. And you have the tailwinds from the IRA increase in the incentives. <br/>So definitely, that's helped put projects together. It also helps that we can co-locate these Greenfield projects at Elk Hills in the Sacramento area. So it's just -- it's an easier process to get to a CDMA.<br/>Existing point sources we talked about it before, but they're still going to price discovery, right? How are, the credit share across the value chain. And you also have to solve forward transportation, how do you move this year to across the state.<br/>We know there's a lot of interest in Sacramento to ensuring that CCS is successful. Everyone understands the transportation is part of the equation. And we're hoping there's some uncertainty right now. We're hoping that uncertainty is clarified in the near term.<br/>But I'm confident we're going to be delivering both projects. Certainly, the going to point source, the ability to deploy more capital, but also increase the EBITDA is something that we're focused on with our partners on Brookfield. So we'll do a little bit of both.<br/>I think if you look at the types of projects that we see in the Q with the types of projects that we're reviewing, you see a pretty good mix between them. It just so happens as we're kind of building kind of this new business live in front of everybody that the first 4 projects are the greenfield, but that's not -- it's this business is not going to be exclusively for greenfield. We will bring some point source projects into hopefully in the near term.",
			"<strong>Scott Michael Hanold</strong>",
			"Yes. And how about the exercising the equity options on those?",
			"<strong>Francisco J. Leon</strong>",
			"Yes. So we reserve the option to invest into the equity of all 4 projects and started with Granites and on Cypress that have been in the works for longer. We're reviewing not only the cost profile of those businesses, but the market, in a lot of cases, like hydrogen, there's not a very well-developed market quite yet, but there's a lot of interest. <br/>And that also requires, understanding the offtake contracts and the depth of the market and work to best place the hydrogen and the ammonia. Ammonia is already tied to a co-op in Sacramento. So we're evaluating both. We like to have a decision this year on s Lone Cypress, in particular. That's going to be the first project we're reviewing the equity. There's a lot to do, but we're excited.<br/>We think these markets will develop nicely in California. There's a lot of support, again, by IRA. Hydrogen has 45 that support it. But we're seeing a lot of potential demand for the product. So both Brookfield and CRC have retained that ability to invest in the equity. And it's something that gets us very excited about participating in these new energy verticals.",
			"<strong>Scott Michael Hanold</strong>",
			"No, I appreciate that. And it sounds like you're putting a lot of depth and a thought of around this. My follow-up question is on those cost savings you talked about. And could you give us a little bit of color on I think you said $20 million. There's kind of a line of sight on it right now. <br/>But what kind of specific cost savings are you really seeing? And what are you targeting? And I'm kind of curious with using, I guess, that A&amp;M service. What specifically was the reason of going like outside to have somebody come in and do that versus doing stuff like CRC? What can't you do on your own that they can come in and help you it?",
			"<strong>Francisco J. Leon</strong>",
			"Yes, Scott. So we were looking for ways to change how we work. CRC does a lot of things really well. It's a company that has been operated in -- on the strictest regulations pretty much in the U.S. So there's a lot of -- there's -- the team works well. We are -- have very high operating standards. <br/>But we need to change how we work. We need to bring costs in line with activity levels. So that requires kind of a business transformation, not just a cost-cutting exercise. So we need to question everything. We need to question how we're organized. We need to question where we prioritize and ultimately look for to make decisions to take some cost out of the system.<br/>The team got to work right away until we came last quarter and described this initiative in $20 million in a couple of months, it's a pretty good win. And again, we're trying not to -- this is not a deferral, this is not removing onetime cost. These are run rate savings. These are permanent savings that we want to pick out of the system.<br/>So we're evaluating contractors. We're evaluating contracts, chemical contracts, for example, how do we use different -- how do we ultimately make decisions across the board. And we're questioning everything, right?<br/>It's a good opportunity for the refresh. It's a good opportunity to say, okay, do we do better and drive that culture going forward. We brought A&amp;M. They're, one, they're a very good team. Two, we want to get that external perspective. California tends to be isolated from what's happening in the rest of the U.S.<br/>We want to bring best practices. And we want their help assessing and ultimately accelerating some of these cost-saving efforts. We've taken a lot of cost out of the system historically at CRC. So the next phase is really one that requires kind of a transformation of how we work. And we felt it was best done with -- help.<br/>So I'm very focused on this cost reduction exercises. And we're getting a lot of great organic support from the team presenting new ideas on how do we make this company better.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And the next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.",
			"<strong>Kaleinoheaokealaula Scott Akamine</strong>",
			"This is actually Kalei on for -- well, for myself. Francisco, following your announcement last quarter regarding a potential separation of CCUS from E&amp;P, we received a lot of imbalance on the power plant. What's the valuation, what's the G&amp;A burden, what does the power market look like? So could you comment on whether it's core to your oil and gas business or whether it's a better fit for a stand-alone CCUS business, noting that there are potential synergies with for CalCapture? <br/>And maybe to add on here, I remember a few years ago, you guys did that deal with Ares. Therefore, if you did something with the power plant here, it wouldn't be the first time. But even in that deal, there was an option to buy it back after a period of time. So that suggests to me that there is maybe some constraints in how you think about structuring it?",
			"<strong>Francisco J. Leon</strong>",
			"Kalei, so, yes, I mean, I think we have a big advantage in the state by owning a power plant at Elk Hills. It's been truly a great asset for us. And it really helps us stay away from the grid at least for part of our fields, which helps us bring down cost alongside with it. <br/>So the plant delivers about 1/3 of the power goes to the oilfield and 2/3 gets sold to, Kalei -- in utilities. So it's been a good, profitable asset for us historically. We have the opportunity to make it better to be able with a capture system, be able to deliver net 0 power in a state that's really hungry for these types of offerings.<br/>So we're evaluating where this asset fits best on a go-forward basis. I mean I think the prospect of having net 0 is appealing to everybody. But you also have to be able to undertake CalCapture, which, as we talked about in the past, it's a capture system on a low concentration stemoCO2, which is going to be on the higher end of the cost spectrum, right?<br/>So how do we make that investment? How do we finance that type of capital call? And ultimately, where does the asset, the long, is it more on CRC or is it more on Carbon TerraVault? Those sorts of things we're working. We did release the collateral from the banks through the RBL. And we're looking to have the flexibility so that we can put that asset to work in the best way possible.<br/>Right now, the way I see the power plant, even though it's a great unique acid industry to California for E&amp;P companies, we see that acid trading as an E&amp;P multiple, right? So having an ability to see the financials, right? So I think some of the things you're asking having the visibility to really showcase how good this plant is and how it can get better by making it a net 0 power plant.<br/>I think it's going to be a great value add and a way to unlock value. So we're working through it, nothing definitive. Hopefully, at least I gave you some of the down work here as we're working through these types of assets and where do they best fit in case we do separate the businesses going forward.",
			"<strong>Kaleinoheaokealaula Scott Akamine</strong>",
			"The quick follow-up there. And I hope you don't count this as my second question. But there was a FEED study that was performed about 2 years ago. And for whatever reason you guys are performing a second feed study. Can you give us an update on where that -- what the status is on that FEED study that you're currently performing?",
			"<strong>Francisco J. Leon</strong>",
			"We'll see if it's your second question or not depending on what the next one looks like. No. So no, I think it's a great question, Kalei. So we did a FEED study with Fluor a few years ago. And now we're doing a second FEED study with Next Decade. <br/>You have to understand, the reason we have 2 FEED studies and we're going to continue looking at the cost is that there hasn't been a capture system put into a natural gas power plant facility of this scale anywhere in the U.S. before.<br/>So we want to make sure that we have the cost right. I mean the technology is really not -- it's not a new technology. It's not something that concerns or maybe the scale us, but is really trying to drive that cost down.<br/>We've had a lot of inflationary pressures over the last 2 years. We want to make sure it's a project that not only delivers that bile to reduce that CO2 emission footprint, but it's also a profitable project. So what you're going to continue seeing from us is really working to that cost profile, how do we invest it on how do we finance this power plant so that we can make to capture happen.<br/>We're targeting FID next year, right? So we're working through it. We're soliciting input. There's a lot of companies that are bringing new ideas, bringing new technology and looking at the supply chain differently.<br/>And we're going to look to award the project to whoever can deliver the best price and ultimately get us a project that we feel comfortable with that can be executed on. So we're working through it.",
			"<strong>Kaleinoheaokealaula Scott Akamine</strong>",
			"I appreciate that. My real second question is on natural gas. So obviously, really big numbers this quarter, hoping that you can help us understand how to model your exposure? Is it bit weak? Or is it Spot? Is it Citygate -- or is it SoCal Border? I think any help here would be appreciated because given the tightness in California, it seems like this could be reoccurring.",
			"<strong>Francisco J. Leon</strong>",
			"Yes. So I'll start, and then I'll turn it over to Jay to give a more in-depth answer. So we do feel this is a California through the regulation and through the penetration of renewables that gas is going to be absolutely needed, not more in the near term, but as we go forward as baseload. <br/>So we're well positioned as the largest natural gas producer in the state. And we see these spikes happening more and more. So definitely, it's something that the state that an Energy Island has kind of decided that's where we're going to be. So these natural gas assets that we own through both power and owning the Sacramento Basin and Elk Hills and Buena Vista all have gas in the right places, gives us a lot of flexibility when we see this market shocks to be able to reposition our assets and go out and try to deliver that gas for the state.<br/>But maybe, Jay, if you can cover a little bit of the pricing around that?",
			"<strong>Jay A. Bys</strong>",
			"Yes. Let me kind of touch on the basic precept here. More times than not, we're going to find ourselves looking to be close to, if not at the first of the month index. We prefer not to carry a lot of gas into the daily market during any particular month. Now in advance of that a bid week cycle or during the bid week cycle, we may take some limited fixed price positions that just simply seem, frankly, attractive given the circumstances that are taking place. <br/>Minor gas for the most part, is produced relative to a SoCal Border index. But as you may or may not be aware, we maintain long-haul transportation from the field on current -- river. And we've got a fairly significant position on the SoCal gas system in terms of BTS. So this is kind of where the semantics get a little bit goofy, I'm afraid. Some people call this trading, we call it marketing and asset management. And the fact is we keep a set of tools around and work very well together. We've got gas production, some of those liquid points in the state.<br/>We maintain that transportation, as I mentioned. We've got some of the most dependable generating capacity in the state. And we've got really the right folks around to make those decisions. So when the market needs power, we move more gas to the power plant. When the market needs gas, we're able to bring more gas to market. So, in general, I think you should probably look at any particular monthly cycle for the first month index, reflective of kind of an 80-20 SoCal Border/PG&amp;E Citygate index.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And the next question comes from Leo Mariani with Roth MKM.",
			"<strong>Leo Paul Mariani</strong>",
			"Why don't you just delve in a little bit more to a few of the numbers sort of around the quarter. Looking at your CapEx, it's quite a bit sort of below guidance? And then just a follow up on the gas price question. I guess when I looked at sort of SoCal Border, Citygate, didn't really matter. I had a hard time getting into the $21.50 that you guys put up in the quarter. So maybe there's kind of some other semantics around the pricing or some other local markets that are kind of less visible outside of these indices that get reported by data agencies like a Bloomberg or sort of whatnot that drove that. But any more color on how you get to the $21.50 and then again, just CapEx nicely below the guide here, so any thoughts on that?",
			"<strong>Francisco J. Leon</strong>",
			"Leo, that sounds good. Let me answer the CapEx question. So we went through 4 months. And I know it's hard to believe of really bad weather in California, a lot of wind, a lot of rain, snow and that affected our operations. The team did a phenomenal job executing through that. And you don't see a lot of impact in production. In fact, we outperformed on production expectations. But it did delay some of the capital activity that we had planned. <br/>We do -- as we step down, we're now running 1 rig in the Wilmington field. We'll continue that throughout the year. But what you should see is a step-up in capital workover activity for the rest of the year and as operations get, normalized. In terms of the gas pricing question, again, I'll turn it over to Jay for an answer.",
			"<strong>Jay A. Bys</strong>",
			"Sure. As I mentioned kind of a couple of moments ago, we did execute a few opportunistic fixed price trades during the bid week cycle. But one thing that kind of gets lost and then trying to get a whole bunch into the weeds when it comes to natural gas pricing is when you see an index posted, natural gas doesn't necessarily trade in the physical market at that price. <br/>There are times of the year when it trades at a discount. And there are times of the year when it will trade at a physical premium. So for example, to get physical gas at SoCal Border, you may end up paying more than the Border price. You'll buy physical gas and index plus number. So we had a fair number of index-plus numbers transacted in our book for the months of January and frankly, February. Both are very strong. A lot of different points in the Western gas market, physical gas was trading at significant premiums to the individual posted financial indexes.<br/>So combined, the opportunistic trades, the limited number we had in that small variation and I think you get there pretty quickly. Again, I'm not sure Q1 of '23 will be representative of what we see for the balance of the year. I think you're going to find that our gas prices are probably in large measure, excluding the fact that we've got a shortage of gas in inventory right now. I think you're going to find them more reflective of the national gas price.",
			"<strong>Francisco J. Leon</strong>",
			"And if I can add one thing. So we have a fantastic marketing and trading team. And then we have a very diversified revenue stream. Last year, we highlighted the NGLs. The NGL barrels were trading higher at some point in the year than our after-hedge oil barrels. This year's natural gas, there will be times where it's electricity, so really feel good about that diversification that we built for CRC and then giving the team an opportunity to manage that to make our most highest return decisions. I think we're set up for success here in the long run.",
			"<strong>Leo Paul Mariani</strong>",
			"Okay. That's very helpful, makes a lot of sense. And then, just kind of sticking with some of the numbers on the quarter here. So looking at your San Joaquin basin gas production, it was down around 10 million a day this quarter versus last. Historically, that gas production has been pretty steady. It doesn't really move around much sort of by quarter. Was there any like maintenance or downtime or was this more of you guys maybe directing more of that gas to the power market and kind of left to the volumes sort of sold market here in the quarter, just looking for any color on that.",
			"<strong>Francisco J. Leon</strong>",
			"The gas, Leo, really was impacted by weather. That's -- you had facilities down because of the high winds and that affected our gas production in particular. So that's really what would happen in the quarter. We do have some maintenance projects throughout the year. But I think Q1, you can attribute most of that change to weather.",
			"<strong>Leo Paul Mariani</strong>",
			"Okay. That's helpful. And then, just on the regulatory front here, kind of any update on just the general permitting situation for oil and gas drilling permits in California. I know the Kern County EIS is still a ways away in the decision. But apart from that, can you maybe just talk to whether or not permits are kind of coming outside of those Kern County areas?",
			"<strong>Francisco J. Leon</strong>",
			"Yes. So yes, no update on the appeal around Kern County EIR, so that's still ongoing. As we said before, we expect that to take some time. So we are getting workover permits in Kern County and throughout the state. So those are flowing. We also filed a CEQA for 3 of our largest fields in Kern County to be able to do field level EIR. That gives us an alternative to be permitting back in the San Joaquin Basin in Kern County. We're building inventory outside of Kern, looking at our gas, wells in the Sacramento Basin and continue to get looking at the South and L.A. Basin as well. <br/>As we said before, we have all the permits in the drilling campaign that we need for '23. So really, all we're doing right now is creating as many options as possible for 2024, so working through those. But again, no permits in Kern County yet other than workover permits, which are flowing.",
			"<strong>Leo Paul Mariani</strong>",
			"Okay. But it sounds like, generally speaking, you guys are able to probably get permits outside of the Kern County EIS. That's something you can still obtain here?",
			"<strong>Francisco J. Leon</strong>",
			"Yes. I mean we were -- like I said, we have all the permits that we need in Wilmington. So that's in good shape. We do expect to get permits outside of Kern County.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And the next question comes from Nate Pendleton with Stifel.",
			"<strong>Nathaniel David Pendleton</strong>",
			"Congrats on a strong quarter. Regarding trucking CO2 at your Carbon TerraVault sites that you alluded to earlier, can you provide any details around whether you're exploring the use of low emissions trucking other sites? And are there any noteworthy cost or throughput implications that we should be thinking about?",
			"<strong>Francisco J. Leon</strong>",
			"Yes. So first of all, on the Greenfield developments that we co-locate at Elk Hills. We'll use our internal gathering lines to be able to move CO2. So that's the first option and that's what we're focused on. To the extent that we're now going into areas that require trucking, yes. So we're looking at low emission vehicles, whether it's hydrogen and fuel cells or other options, so that's very much part of the plan, right? <br/>Ultimately, these projects need to provide across the board low-emission solution in order for them to work and to get the full benefit of the credit. So -- definitely thinking through that as we move CO2 across the state and as we wait for the uncertainty on pipelines to be resolved. But the first order of business and how we're going to get to CO2 injection much quicker is to be able to co-locate the plant on top of our reservoir and just have deal with behind the fence gathering systems.",
			"<strong>Nathaniel David Pendleton</strong>",
			"Great. And stepping back out a bit. Over the past few months, we've been tracking an increasing number of Class VI permits, both in California and across the country. At a high level, can you speak to how Carbon TerraVault is differentiated in this growing industry and how you plan to capitalize on your first-mover advantage going forward?",
			"<strong>Francisco J. Leon</strong>",
			"No, absolutely. So we filed our first permit in August of 2021, second permit in November of '21. So when we talk to the EPA at the time of filing, they said it's going to take 18 to 24 months. But really, this new era of Class VI permits was just starting a lot of uncertainty in the process. We learned a lot throughout the thing that EPA has as well. What we know is there's a high rigor on all fronts. Technically, commercially, that's expected from anybody that submits an application. We've seen some permissions, some permits being withdrawn. And I think we have everything that it takes to have our permit come in this year. We've done a lot of work technically. We have seismic. <br/>We have a good understanding of the reservoir at Elk Hills. Our team has worked diligently to position the permit in the best way possible with the EPA. We're working with having support from the local communities in Kern County to bring these projects forward and have really good dialogue with the EPA. So I think we're in the running to be one of the first permits by the EPA. I think we're right there, begin given the dialogue, given the progress that we made. I feel very good that we're going to have the permit this year.<br/>And the key is that first permit is a big catalyst, catalyst to more projects, more emission sources coming together to really giving the market transparency as to what happens next. And I think what we heard through multiple channels is that Carbon TerraVault is putting some of the best positioned permits out there. And again, we're working well with the EPA to try to get that to the finish line.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) And the next question comes from Noel Parks with Tuohy Brothers Investment Research.",
			"<strong>Noel Augustus Parks</strong>",
			"Just a couple of things. There's sort of high-level questions, but I'm just thinking about, I guess, overall, looking at some of your -- or hoping to get some thoughts on where you might see in the carbon business, a greater degree of vertical integration over time. <br/>And of course, you announced today a couple of new storage only deals. So clearly, you like the margins from that business line. And you've given us some guidance on what those economics might look like. So where would you -- I mean, do you see any low-hanging fruit as far as over time, bringing more project development or even construction activities in-house over time.<br/>Or the way the early processes are unfolding is that pretty much the sort of ideal I guess, burden of risk reward that you'd be looking to achieve?",
			"<strong>Francisco J. Leon</strong>",
			"Yes, so a lot in that question. Let me try to address it. So on these Greenfield projects, as a reminder, we see port space as being the scarce resource in the state. In contrary, in other parts where -- what we've said is our type curve is going to deliver between $50 and $75 per ton for storage only deals. All 4 CDMAs that we signed today fit within that type curve. So not only are we validating the port space scarcity point. But you have third parties that ultimately work their economics through and value that storage and port space. <br/>It's difficult to say where we're going to have the most vertical integration. But as we take -- you have the option to invest equity into these projects, we're learning a lot, right? We're not a hydrogen company. We're not green or blue. We're not ammonia companies. But so we're trying to understand the business model. And if there's a way to add value and it's a way to make good returns, it's something that we'd like to do. We do see integration happening not only with ourselves as you bring power, you can sell power sell natural gas into these projects and provide land.<br/>But we're seeing integration even amongst the partners that we're bringing together as we developed these big industrial centers, net 0 industrial centers like we have at Elk Hills. It's hard to say if we need to bring this house -- these projects in-house. Right now, we're looking to partner with really smart people that have done this before. And they were just looking to develop a market in California, which seems to be the most attractive to get these green projects underway. So I don't know yet about in-house projects. We'll see. It's too early that it's a difficult question to answer. But we do -- I do know that we're seeing the California energy sector in a very different light as we get exposed to all these projects coming through the door.",
			"<strong>Noel Augustus Parks</strong>",
			"And maybe sort of continuing along similar lines of discussion. The net 0 industrial park, could you maybe talk about the business development process for that? We get some sense of some of the building blocks from the announced projects. I'm just curious about criteria of what sort of projects maybe you are eager to get more of or would rule in and as opposed to maybe types of projects you would be more inclined to rule out for the industrial product setting?",
			"<strong>Francisco J. Leon</strong>",
			"Yes. No, I mean I think we have a lot of conversations are ongoing. And I think you're only able to see the 4 that we brought forward in terms of CDMA. We're evaluating multiples of what we brought in -- as we talked about before, we feel we're oversubscribed. So that means we're talking to many more parties than we have capacity for. So there is a selection process, right? So obviously, we're dealing with people that have the credibility and they can bring these projects forward where we can get permits locally as well and that are serving a market need and that these projects are ultimately going to have strong long-term off-takes to be able to lock in returns and ultimately do incremental financing. <br/>So there is a selection process, right? That's why we moved -- we're not doing MOUs just for the sake of announcing that we're making progress. We're really focused on conditions precedent, we're finalizing contracts that have much more need to them because we want to make sure we can -- we are building this -- all these projects that need to be able to come together so that we can get to our injection targets by 2025 and then 2027-2028 for the 5 million tons.<br/>So we are selecting, right? You have this funnel. And we are kind of high grading the projects that we think can, to the finish line and provide good returns for us in Brookfield, our partners. So it's hard to say what we are not considering without being specific.<br/>But I would say what you see is a high-graded list of projects that we feel very strongly that we can execute on.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And the next question comes from Eric Seeve with GoldenTree.",
			"<strong>Eric Seeve</strong>",
			"Another follow-on question regarding the CO2 business. In terms of the projects in the queue and those that you're still talking to, you gave us some color earlier that it's a mix of Greenfield and Brownfield that was interesting. <br/>I'm curious in terms of the potential size of those projects. Is it in line with the size of the projects you've already announced? And when I talk about size, I'm talking about million tons of CO2 sequestered each year.<br/>Are the remaining projects you anticipate on -- are they similar size? Or are there some bigger chunkier ones out there? Any color on that would be appreciated.",
			"<strong>Francisco J. Leon</strong>",
			"Eric, so I mean -- so remember, we're dealing with a total addressable market of 400 million tons of emissions in California, right? So there's definitely, as you said chunky emission sources out there. <br/>And you're -- naturally, if you're having to put investment on capture, if you're having to connect points force to sync and put pipelines in place, you're going to have to have a scale naturally to those points worse projects.<br/>Now having said that, we look at all of these projects. We look at proximity to our tanks. We looked at counterparty. And we look at the commercial aspects of the injection payment, right? So in order if we do a full CCS as a service, what that means?<br/>So it's hard to answer that question. But we are looking at multiple sized projects throughout the state. But there are some big emitters that need solutions, right? There are emitters out there that right now, they're paying $30 per ton of carbon tax, and that's increasing every year.<br/>They're also probably going through trying to replicate what we're doing and finding out the subsurface and permitting it's probably not a core competency. So we're having those dialogues we're educating. We're trying to land the right deal and the right partner and expect some point source legacy emissions hopefully in the near term, but we're working through it.<br/>And but again, the size of the price is big. It's just a matter of figuring out, okay, what's, the best place to store the CO2 in averaging terms?",
			"<strong>Eric Seeve</strong>",
			"And one follow-up. I mean it seems like Elk Hills is really, really well suited to get a lot of attractive projects here. But it sounds like you're going to be well oversubscribed. Are there -- is there more potential storage space in that field that you guys are evaluating?",
			"<strong>Francisco J. Leon</strong>",
			"Yes, for sure. I mean Elk Hills 47,000 acres, fee simple property with a power plant with natural gas with a lot of elements to bring new technology into the field. We're looking for ways to add incremental port space. <br/>I mean we've already expanded one of our permits in 26 hours, so yes, ultimately, as we draw more oil and gas, we're creating port space, right? And at some point, that port space and the injection of CO2 may be more valuable than what we're extracting. That's not the case today, but it could be.<br/>So the key is having those tanks that we know I don't understand really well. And as the market comes together and as we see the value of in storing CO2, we will be looking for ways to create more port space. At Elk Hills, we're in the new proximity down there. We do see a lot of running room in the Sacramento area. There's a lot of newer emissions near there and we're building a very, very nice portfolio of assets. So creating these 2 options I think gives us the most access to the market that we can see.",
			"<strong>Eric Seeve</strong>",
			"Terrific. And second question is with -- as we model out the production, oil and gas production throughout the remainder of the year. Just trying to understand, are there -- is there any -- other than potential impacts from adverse weather, are there any scheduled maintenance downs that would impact the quarterly production cadence or should we just -- can we sort of annualize the sort of rate we see progressing from Q1 to Q2?",
			"<strong>Francisco J. Leon</strong>",
			"Yes. So we provided Q2 guidance. There is -- one of our plans in Elk Hills was down for maintenance a couple of weeks ago, but that's reflected in the guidance for Q2. What we said is because we're only going to do drilling activity with permits on hand. And so effectively, that's one rig for the rest of the year. We see production declining between, 5% to 7% for the year, entry-to-exit. <br/>So that number still looks good to us as we go here. So more -- we held -- production held up very nicely in Q1. We will start seeing a little bit of a decline in Q2 and that will be the case for the rest of the year. So it's not going to be copy-paste Q1. You should look at the guidance and the trend, we do see 5% to 7% decline for the year.",

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Duke Energy's TSR for the last 5 years was 54%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!",

On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 9% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend.

			"<b>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</b>",
			"In addition to net income as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), Exelon evaluates its operating performance using the measure of Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings because management believes it represents earnings directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses, and other specified items. This measure is intended to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of period over period operating results and provide an indication of Exelon’s baseline operating performance excluding items that are considered by management to be not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. In addition, this measure is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentation. Exelon has provided the non-GAAP financial measure as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings should not be deemed more useful than, a substitute for, or an alternative to the most comparable GAAP Net Income measures provided in this earnings release and attachments.

			"Thanks a lot, Sam, and good afternoon, everybody. Edison International's core EPS for first quarter 2023 was $1.09. We are pleased with our start to the year, and we are confident in affirming our 2023 core EPS guidance of $4.55 to $4.85 We also remain confident in delivering our long-term EPS growth target of 5% to 7% from 2021 to 2025. Maria will discuss our financial performance and outlook. <br/>My key message today is that we continue to see a number of positives in the near term and in the long term. And these make us excited for our company's future. SCE's actions to sustain and strengthen the electric grid, mitigate wildfires and enable carbonization through electrification are critically needed by California and are increasing our investment opportunity. <br/>In the longer term, our Pathway 2045 analysis highlights the continued investment in transmission and distribution needed to evolve the grid. This is being recognized by regulators in California. <br/>In 2021, the California ISO released a 20-year plan, estimating about $30 billion of transmission investments needed through 2040, consistent with our Pathway analysis. Only a few weeks ago, CAISO published its Draft 2022 to 2023 Transmission Plan, with its current thinking on system needs over the next 10 years. Their draft plan calls for 46 transmission projects with a total estimated cost of $9.3 billion. Over $2 billion of that represents proposed incumbent projects for SCE and over $5 billion represents FERC Order 1000 competitive projects within Southern California for which SCE will be able to compete. <br/>In the near term, SCE continues its diligent execution of its Wildfire Mitigation Plan and has reduced the probability of losses from catastrophic wildfires by 75% to 80% compared to pre-2018 levels, predominantly from grid hardening measures that allow the utility to mitigate risk while keeping electricity flowing to our customers. <br/>I want to say thanks again to the many of you who visited us in person at our headquarters and heard directly from several of our leaders about the utility's achievements and ongoing actions. <br/>In March, SCE filed its 2023 to 2025 WMP with the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety. Highlights of the plan are shown on Page 3. Our #1 priority remains the safety of the public, customers, workers and first responders. In 2023, the utility is building on the work already accomplished while focusing on 5 key areas. These are: Continuing to harden the grid, ramping up targeted undergrounding work in severe risk areas, continuing to reduce PSPS impacts, expanding aerial fire suppression funding to year-round and further in technological advancements. <br/>SCE's flagship grid hardening program, covered conductor, remains its key mitigation measure. More than 2,850 additional miles of covered conductor will be installed between 2023 and 2025. By the end of 2025, SCE expects to have replaced more than 7,200 miles or about 3/4 of overhead distribution power lines in high fire risk areas with covered conductor. SCE also plans to complete about 100 miles of undergrounding by 2025 to address the high risk presented by unique factors in certain areas and plans to underground a total of 600 miles by the end of 2028. <br/>Additionally, to quickly suppress fires regardless of how they start and protect the communities SCE serves, the utility continues to partner with the LA County Fire Department, Orange County Fire Authority and Ventura County Fire Department to expand their firefighting capabilities. <br/>As highlighted in the WMP, this support has been expanded to year-round aerial fire suppression from the Quick Reaction Force, made up of the world's largest fire suppression helicopters with unique night firefighting capabilities. <br/>The WMP is adaptive, and it's focused on furthering technological advancements to find new ways to mitigate wildfire risk. SCE is continuously developing new approaches and collaborating with other utilities with academia and with the energy sector to make our community safer. The WMP highlights technologies such as the Rapid Earth Current Limiter, Early Fault Detection and using artificial intelligence that will continue to advance our suite of wildfire mitigation measures. <br/>Going back to the long-term deal, a key driver for SCE's investment in the grid and for enabling customer affordability is transportation electrification. Now we aren't just talking here about regulatory policies or long-term forecasts, we are seeing customers really start to embrace and adopt EVs today, including operators of medium- and heavy-duty vehicle fleets. SCE was an early mover and today has the country's largest suite of transportation electrification programs led by an investor-owned utility with over $800 million in approved funding for its Charge Ready programs, which include a program aimed at the medium- and heavy-duty segment. <br/>Momentum and customer interest have certainly increased, and we are beginning to see vehicle availability improvements in the heavy-duty segment with more options available to order. SCE is currently working with nearly 200 sites to potentially support approximately 4,000 medium and heavy-duty vehicles. Customers operating heavy-duty vehicles are requesting higher-powered chargers, resulting in larger load requests that may require additional distribution system upgrades to ensure adequate capacity is available. <br/>SCE continues to engage with these customers to understand when and where these vehicles will materialize to ensure the grid is ready. Beyond transportation electrification, building electrification is another critical opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. SCE has proposed a $677 million program to help catalyze the adoption of the electric heat pumps and that is currently being reviewed by the CPUC. <br/>I will conclude by noting that even as SCE makes substantial investment in the grid to keep the utility and the state on track, for decarbonization and electrification efforts, affordability is always top of mind. SCE's long-standing culture of actively pursuing and maintaining productivity improvement and cost control measures has enabled it to have the lowest system average rate among California investor-owned utilities. <br/>Some recent examples include the pending settlement agreement with TURN and Cal Advocates to move to a customer-funded wildfire self-insurance model and SCE's operational excellence program, which includes over 600 employee-driven ideas with capital efficiency and O&amp;M benefits. These include work planning, procurement and technology as shown on Page 4. <br/>Beyond these, we will constantly pursue new opportunities for our digitization, automation, and generative artificial intelligence to drive further improvements in customer interactions, asset data quality and back-office efficiencies. The expected benefits should progressively increase as we accelerate implementation through 2024 and beyond, further benefiting affordability for SCE's customers. <br/>With that, Maria will provide her financial report.",
			"<strong>Maria C. Rigatti</strong>",
			"Thanks, Pedro, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will discuss first quarter results, our 2023 EPS guidance, our 2023 financing plan and other financial topics. <br/>Starting with the first quarter of 2023, EIX reported core EPS of $1.09. As you can see from the year-over-year quarterly variance analysis shown on Page 5, SCE's first quarter earnings increased primarily due to GRC attrition year escalation. This was partially offset by higher net interest expense, driven by higher interest rates associated with funding 2017 and 2018 wildfire claims payments. At EIX Parent and Other, there was a negative variance of $0.04 due to higher holding company interest expense. <br/>I would now like to discuss SCE's capital and rate base forecast shown on Pages 6 and 7. These are consistent with last quarter's disclosure. SCE will file its 2025 GRC application in mid-May, and we will update our capital and rate base projections and extend them through 2028 at that time. <br/>Over the coming years, SCE will continue to invest in wildfire mitigation and increase its grid work to meet the needs of its customers while also supporting California's leading role in building a carbon-free economy. You can see this increased investment begin in our projections for 2025 capital spending, which is just under $7 billion. As a point of reference, only 6 years ago, our annual CapEx was less than $4 billion. <br/>Let me provide a brief update on the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events. As outlined on Page 8, in the first quarter, SCE resolved about $148 million in individual plaintiff claims. This continued progress settling claims enables us to move further along in resolving these historical events. Naturally, as we proceed towards full resolution, we continue to gain more and more information. <br/>Each quarter, we take our cumulative experience into account as we refine the best estimates. Consequently, SCE adjusted the best estimate upward by $90 million. More importantly, with this progress, the utility remains confident that it will file the TKM cost recovery application in the third quarter of this year. Our message is very clear, SCE will seek full CPUC cost recovery, excluding amounts forgone under the agreement with the Safety Enforcement Division or already recovered. SCE will show its strong, compelling case that it operated its system prudently and that it is in the public interest to authorize full cost recovery. <br/>Turning to guidance. Page 9 shows our 2023 EPS guidance and the key assumptions for modeling purposes. We are pleased with our start to the year and are confident in affirming our 2023 core EPS guidance of $4.55 to $4.85. <br/>Progress related to the parent company's 2023 financing plan is shown on Page 10. In March, we issued $500 million of junior subordinated notes, which provided $250 million of equity content. The transaction was in line with our expectations and we were pleased to see strong investor support for this offering, which was significantly oversubscribed. We expect to generate approximately $100 million of equity through internal programs consistent with the $300 million to $400 million of equity content in our financing plan. <br/>To add another highlight on the financing front, just last week, SCE closed on a securitization financing for the final portion of the $1.6 billion in AB 1054 capital expenditures. SCE saw a very robust investor engagement for the $775 million offering. This resulted in a cost-effective transaction for SCE's customers and allow the utility to repay an outstanding term loan, further improving its credit profile. <br/>Please turn to Page 11. In addition to growing investor support, we are seeing our strengthening business and credit profile reflected in the rating agencies' outlook. In February, Moody's upgraded EIX and SCE's credit ratings by 1 notch, reflecting the decline in wildfire risk facing SCE. Additionally, last week, Fitch upgraded EIX and SCE's credit ratings by 1 notch, noting the meaningful decline in major wildfires linked to SCE's equipment post 2018, despite elevated wildfire activity in California in 2020 and 2021, and ongoing efforts to enhance system resilience while mitigating reliance on and frequency of public safety power shutoffs. <br/>Page 12 provides an update on the CPUC cost of capital mechanism. If the 12-month average of the Moody's Baa utility bond index exceeds 5.37% at the end of September, SCE will file a Tier 2 advice letter to implement the adjustment to the 2024 ROE. The adjustment would be equal to half the difference between the average and 4.37%. The mechanism also updates the authorized cost of debt and preferred equity. Through April 25, the measurement period average is around 5.7%. We will continue monitoring the cost of capital mechanism, which could result in significant upside to 2024 earnings should it trigger. <br/>Looking ahead, we are reiterating our 5% to 7% EPS growth rate guidance from 2021 through 2025, which translates to 2025 EPS of $5.50 to $5.90. My management team and I are fully committed to delivering on this target. We will provide an update on our EPS growth rate projections through 2028 on our Q2 earnings call. <br/>With strong rate base growth as the underlying driver, coupled with the significant investment needed in our electric grid, we continue to be optimistic about the company's growth prospects, both near and long term. <br/>That concludes my remarks. Sam?",
			"<strong>Sam Ramraj</strong>",
			"Ted, please open the call for questions. As a reminder, we request to you to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so everyone in line has the opportunity to ask questions.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) The first question is from Angie Storozynski with Seaport.",
			"<strong>Agnieszka Anna Storozynski</strong>",
			"Okay. So my first question, so just looking at the settlements of the 2017 and 2018 claims. So you didn't settle anything more since basically the fourth quarter update?",
			"<strong>Maria C. Rigatti</strong>",
			"No, Angie, this is Maria. We actually settled about $148 million in additional claims during the quarter. So we have been settling more claims. We report on the amount settled in each quarter. So last quarter, the pace of the demand did slow down some. But it's -- we're still very well positioned, and we will be filing our first cost recovery application in Q3 for the TKM events.",
			"<strong>Agnieszka Anna Storozynski</strong>",
			"Okay. That's fine. And then for the SEC (sic) [SCE] GRC application that you'll file in May, do you plan to assume positive load growth in your filing?",
			"<strong>Pedro J. Pizarro</strong>",
			"So we will be filing that in another 1.5 weeks or so. I think we reported in the last quarter that we're seeing load growth picking up, and there are assumptions built into the rate case. You'll see those when we file it, but there are assumptions built into the rate case on load growth. <br/>Steve Powell, do you want to add anything there?",
			"<strong>Steven D. Powell</strong>",
			"I guess as we -- not around load growth, you expect to see in the rate case, focus on all the things we need to do on the grid both to deal with customer demand right now as well as the load growth we may see from electrification and other things. And so that will be a focus on reliability, including looking at infrastructure replacement that has been ramped down over the last number of years, while we've dealt with a lot more wildfire mitigation. <br/>So you'll see more wildfire mitigation activities in there, both continuation of our covered conductor program as well as the move towards some targeted undergrounding, continued adaptation investments, and of course, dealing with what we project to be load growth that between now and 2035, is going to be about 2% a year on average. <br/>So that will drive investments in the grid. And of course, with all of it, it's making sure we're thinking about it from an affordability perspective, balancing the needed investments in the grid with the customers' needs for affordability.",
			"<strong>Agnieszka Anna Storozynski</strong>",
			"Okay. And my last question for Maria. So given all of the credit upgrades and reduction in wildfire risk, have you seen -- and again, I could probably see myself, but have you seen a meaningful reduction in your credit spreads? I'm just wondering if everybody else in the industry is actually seeing a growth in their cost of debt. Are you guys actually seeing some reversal of the risk premium that is positioning you better versus peers in the industry?",
			"<strong>Maria C. Rigatti</strong>",
			"Sure. So Angie, I think we've -- for a long time, we've had the reverse, right, where there's been a big gap between us and where others in the industry are. We share that with the commission as well. We are seeing some improvement. I think there's still room for improvement, and it's one of the things that we're very focused on over time. But we have seen some benefits from some of these recent upgrades.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question is from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.",
			"<strong>Shahriar Pourreza</strong>",
			"Pedro, you mentioned the CAISO transmission plan and sort of that associated CapEx opportunities in your prepared remarks. Just to clarify, those have not been assumed in your current 5% to 7% growth guidance? And maybe just tying into the CAISO AB 538 is proposing to kind of expand CAISO into western RTO, does that put further tailwinds for transmission development there?",
			"<strong>Pedro J. Pizarro</strong>",
			"Yes. So on the first part of the question, no, those are not part of our '21 to '25 EPS growth rate. And in fact, the chances are that those projects would be early in the development process by 2025 since they're only now being identified by the CAISO. As you know, one of the challenge, Shar is that today, transmission development can take a decade, largely because of the approval and permitting and signing processes. So we're also looking at the efforts at the federal level and state levels to expedite permitting and signing. So that's on the transmission piece. <br/>On your question about Western regional market expansion, we're monitoring the bell. We are actually very supportive of the concept of an expanded CAISO providing a platform to become a Western regional market. Of course, the demo will be in the details. And we want to make sure that, that expansion if and when it happens, and hopefully, it will, but that it's done with all the right sort of safeguards in place to make sure that right benefits accrue both to California and other states customers. <br/>And you asked whether that could add tailwinds -- and I think of it as it's a larger market will provide greater opportunities to minimize the cost of the clean energy transition, will allow better sharing of resources across the west. And so at its core, I think the main benefit of it would be to provide a platform to support greater affordability for both California customers and customers across the West. <br/>And we mentioned in remarks here, we are mindful of affordability, it's something we continue to focus a lot on. So anything like a Western regional market that helps bring down the cost of the transition is a good thing then in terms of creating more room in our rates to either minimize rates or to provide rate room for all the other projects that are important here. <br/>As to whether a western regional market might mean more transmission projects, ultimately for SCE, it's a little harder to tell. And I think the main benefit is that cost reduction for customers.",
			"<strong>Shahriar Pourreza</strong>",
			"Got it. And then lastly, obviously, you guys just completed your financing plan, but there is somewhat of a cash pay convert market forming, several peers have tapped it. Some don't even need equity. Your embedded interest cost is over 6%, which is obviously materially higher than this market. Any kind of interest there in that? And could that be sort of accretive to the current plan?",
			"<strong>Maria C. Rigatti</strong>",
			"Yes. Shar, it's Maria. So the financing we've done to date has been consistent with what we said on our last call in terms of the total $1.4 billion. And the junior subordinated notes were aimed at the equity content. Balance of the equity content, we're going to be addressing through our internal programs. So that's one piece of it. <br/>In terms of the debt financing that we have to do the balance for the balance of the year, we're going to look at all the different options. We want to be efficient. We want to consider all of the costs, the all-in cost of doing that and take into consideration both the near term but also the longer-term potential costs associated with that. But we're going to keep everything on our radar.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question is from Ryan Levine with Citi.",
			"<strong>Ryan Michael Levine</strong>",
			"Follow-up on some of the transmission comments or questions. In terms of the initial FERC Order 1000 transmission projects, when do you think the company is likely to pursue those from a time line standpoint?",
			"<strong>Pedro J. Pizarro</strong>",
			"Ryan, you're cutting up a little bit. Would you mind repeating the question? Maybe a bad phone line or so.",
			"<strong>Ryan Michael Levine</strong>",
			"In terms of the FERC Order 1000 transmission lines, from a time line standpoint, when do you think the company is looking to pursue those opportunities?",
			"<strong>Pedro J. Pizarro</strong>",
			"Yes. So it really starts with what time line the CAISO follows for the process of finalizing the transmission plan and then ultimately taking projects through that competitive process. I don't know that we have a specific time table yet. But Steve, are you aware of anything more specific at this point?",
			"<strong>Steven D. Powell</strong>",
			"Yes. I think -- so in the draft plan, there were 4 projects identified that would be eligible for competition. They still have to finalize and approve the draft plan. And then in terms of the bidding windows, I believe some of the bidding windows start as early as beginning of the summer and into the fall. So the project evaluation bidding is kind of later this year in terms of when bidders would be going in on those projects.",
			"<strong>Ryan Michael Levine</strong>",
			"Okay. And then the follow-up, maybe for Maria. If those projects were to be one, how would you look at the financing of the incremental capital, given that it's more long duration?",
			"<strong>Maria C. Rigatti</strong>",
			"Yes. So when SCE bids and wins, we'll finance that the way we would finance our normal rate base investments, Ryan. So we'll do that in the normal course. I think that there will be a lot of opportunity for us to be able to finance all of it.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question is from Gregg Orrill with UBS.",
			"<strong>Gregg Gillander Orrill</strong>",
			"Maybe just a quick one on the pending heat pumps investment. And just wondering what you would expect the duration of that program would be to spend the money, the $677 million.",
			"<strong>Pedro J. Pizarro</strong>",
			"That was -- our proposal for that was a 5-year program. And I can just -- I think it's either 4- or 5-year, 4-year program. And just to remind you, it's -- we proposed in there around deployment of 0.25 million heat pumps. We also propose to take about 1/3 of the customers with getting heat pumps and upgrading their homes for broader electrification to make them electrification-ready. <br/>Around 90% of the program is targeted towards residential customers and a good portion of that is targeting low income and disadvantaged communities. It is still going to the PUC process and so we think about 4 years or so deployment time line after PUC approval.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.",
			"<strong>Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith</strong>",
			"Look, I wanted to come back to the commentary about the update forthcoming. When you made the -- obviously, mid-May, we've got this rate base update coming. It seemed like in the prepared remarks, you were alluding to a potential extension of the earnings outlook with the second quarter call. Can you affirm that, just think of -- provide us some context to the parameters that you're thinking there in like base year, et cetera, but more specifically also how you think about maybe the EPS trajectory relative to the rate base that you'll release here with mid-May?",
			"<strong>Maria C. Rigatti</strong>",
			"Those are all great questions, Julien. Let me take them from a timing perspective first. So when we file the rate case in mid-May, we will provide an update at that point relative to capital spend and rate base, and that will be through 2028. So that's consistent with the time line of the general rate case itself. On the Q2 call, we will then add to that our EPS projections through 2028. So your other questions are really excellent, but we'll bring all of that into play on the Q2 call.",
			"<strong>Pedro J. Pizarro</strong>",
			"So stay tuned.",
			"<strong>Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith</strong>",
			"Got it. Okay. Understood. And base year will be rolled forward by a couple of years?",
			"<strong>Maria C. Rigatti</strong>",
			"So we'll go into all that detail when we get to the Q2 call.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And that was the last question. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Sam Ramraj.",
			"<strong>Sam Ramraj</strong>",
			"Well, thank you for joining us. This concludes the conference call. Have a good rest of the day and stay safe, everyone. You may now disconnect.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time."

The press release, attachments and slides for today's discussion are posted on our IR website at investor.pseg.com, and our 10-Q will be filed shortly.<br/>PSEG's earnings release and other matters discussed during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. We will also discuss non-GAAP operating earnings which differs from net income or net loss, as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP in the United States. We include reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures and a disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements on our IR website and in today's materials.<br/>Following Ralph and Dan's prepared remarks, we will conduct a 30-minute question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Ralph LaRossa.",
			"<strong>Ralph A. LaRossa</strong>",
			"Thank you, Carlotta. Good morning to everyone, and thanks for joining us to review PSEG's first quarter results. As indicated in our release, PSEG reported first quarter 2023 net income of $1.287 billion or $2.58 a share compared to a net loss of $2 million or less than $0.01 a share for the first quarter of 2022. Non-GAAP operating earnings for the first quarter were $695 million or $1.39 per share compared to $672 million or $1.33 per share for the first quarter of 2022.<br/>The non-GAAP results for first quarter 2023 and 2022 exclude items shown in Attachment 7 and 8 provided in the release. PSEG delivered solid operating and financial performance to begin the year, and we are on track to achieve our full year 2023 non-GAAP operating earnings guidance of $3.40 to $3.50 per share. We are executing our plan to grow PSEG while also increasing its predictability, which we outlined in our March 10 investor conference. In addition to introducing PSEG's 10-year capital spending forecast during the conference, we announced the decision to retain our 5-unit nuclear generating fleet and exit offshore wind generation.<br/>The utility invested approximately $800 million during the first quarter of 2023, consistent with its full year capital plan of $3.5 billion. These investments will be directed to modernizing T&amp;D infrastructure, clean energy future programs and the last mile projects in the infrastructure advancement program that support New Jersey's policies for energy transition. The 2023 capital spending program also represents PSE&amp;G's largest investment plan to date and drives PSEG's long-term growth outlook for non-GAAP operating earnings of 5% to 7% over the 5-year period through 2027.<br/>PSE&amp;G completed the second phase of its Gas System Monetization Program in February. And in order to continue these critical infrastructure investments proposed a third phase with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, or the BPU, to invest $2.5 billion over a 3-year period. This effort will reduce methane leaks and carbon emissions as we work to expand clean energy options for our customers.<br/>Also in February, the BPU approved an accounting order allowing PSE&amp;G to modify its methodology for amortizing a component of pension expense for ratemaking purposes. This is consistent with our request to reduce the impact of pension accounting on our reported results. Additionally, during the first quarter, PSEG achieved several milestone metrics in customer satisfaction and nuclear operations, ratified new labor agreements with all of our New Jersey unions and implemented back-to-back gas supply cost reductions that helped on the customer affordability front.<br/>On the customer satisfaction measures, PSE&amp;G achieved top quartile performance overall among large utilities in the East in J.D. Power's first quarter 2023 residential electric and gas studies. This follows our full year 2022 J.D. Power recognition of ranking #1 in customer satisfaction with both residential electric and gas service among large utilities in the East.<br/>On the customer affordability front, PSE&amp;G implemented 2 basic gas supply service commodity charge reductions during the 2023 heating season, resulting in a total bill reduction of approximately 14% per month for a typical residential gas customer.<br/>Our nuclear fleet demonstrated strong performance in the first quarter, operated at 100% capacity factor and maintained a strong ranking on the Institute for Nuclear Power Operations performance indicator index. We have also authorized the funding required to transition our 100% owned Hope Creek unit from an 18-month to a 24-month fuel cycle starting in 2025 and our monitoring NRC approval of a fuel change that would enable the transition of our co-owned Salem units to a 24-month fuel cycle in the future.<br/>We also continue to evaluate power upgrade options for our Salem units to increase their generation capacity in the back half of this decade. Salem Unit 2 has completed a scheduled refueling outage and was synchronized for the regional power grid last Friday. Turning to our union contracts, following constructive discussions, PSEG recently reached new 4-year labor agreements with all of our unions representing employees in New Jersey. This provides all parties with visibility and predictability on compensation and benefits into 2027.<br/>During 2022, PSEG also hired over 1,000 new employees and maintained and created thousands of essential good-paying jobs for the New Jersey economy, like PSE&amp;G's award-winning clean energy jobs training program, which is focused on employment opportunities for underserved communities.<br/>Turning to Governor Murphy's 3 executive orders issued in February to combat climate change and power the next New Jersey. We are developing proposals to help support and advance the state's updated and expanded energy policy goals, which we also believe can represent a $3 billion to $7 billion incremental investment opportunity for PSE&amp;G through 2032.<br/>BPU is expected to be the primary implementation agency for all 3 executive orders over the next 12 to 18 months. We anticipate that the BPU will update their energy master plan with specific short- and long-term proposals to achieve the state's accelerated target of 100% of electricity sold in the state coming from carbon-free resources by 2035, using a strategic road map with strategies to achieve the goals of having 400,000 homes, 20,000 commercial properties and an additional 10% of all low-to-moderate income properties, electrification ready by 2030, and (inaudible) stakeholder process for the future of natural gas utilities, aimed at reducing emissions, all consistent with the state goals, while also considering impacts on costs and jobs.<br/>On the ESG front, Forbes recently added PSEG to its 2023 list of America's best employers for diversity. In addition, PSEG continues to work towards developing and submitting for validation our emissions targets for Scope 1, 2 and 3 to the U.N. backed science-based target initiative this fall. But we are off to a solid start in 2023. We are on track with PSEG's full year 2023 non-GAAP operating earnings guidance of $3.40 to $3.50 per share and with PSE&amp;G's $3.5 billion planned capital spend for 2023.<br/>The 5-year capital spending program over 2023 to 2027 of $15.5 billion to $18 billion drives our 6% to 7.5% compound annual growth rate in rate base over that same 5-year period. These utility investments and the cash generation from our nuclear fleet position us to continue supporting growth in our common dividend, which we recently raised by $0.12 to the indicative annual rate of $2.28 per share. It enables funding our capital investment program through 2027 without the need to issue new equity or sell parts of our company in order to grow.<br/>The month of May marks the 120th anniversary of Public Service. We thank our 12,000 dedicated employees and the ones before us for carrying forward the company's proud legacy of safe and reliable service. As we look to the next 120 years, I see a long runway of opportunity in the energy transition. We are seeing trends like the new business request trickle in from behind the charger infrastructure work, policymakers pushing ahead on the next phase of offshore wind transmission and future investment opportunities in New Jersey's accelerated and expanded clean energy policy goals.<br/>In fact, just last week, the BPU in keeping with their stated intentions open the next solicitation window for offshore wind transmission solutions in 2024. The Board staff and PDM recommended the PSE&amp;G Deans 500 kV substation as the preferred interconnection point to facilitate the additional injection of 3,500 megawatts of power, part of New Jersey's goal of adding 11,000 megawatts of offshore wind resources. We fully intend to continue pursuing regulated offshore wind transmission investment opportunities, both at our utility and separately at PSEG Power and Other. This ongoing investment in the New Jersey economy and its energy infrastructure improves the reliability of our networks as well as the predictability of the business, which we hope our stakeholders find to be a compelling value proposition. I'll now turn the call over to Dan for more details on the operating results, and we'll be available for your questions after his remarks.",
			"<strong>Daniel J. Cregg</strong>",
			"Good morning, everybody, and thank you, Ralph. As Ralph mentioned, for the first quarter of 2023, PSEG reported net income of $1.287 billion or $2.58 per share compared to a net loss of $2 million or less than $0.01 per share for the first quarter of 2022.<br/>Non-GAAP operating earnings for the first quarter of 2023 were $695 million or $1.39 per share compared to $672 million or $1.33 per share for the first quarter of 2022. We have provided you with information on Slide 9 regarding the contribution to non-GAAP operating earnings per share by business for the first quarter of 2023 and Slide 10 contains a waterfall chart that takes you through the net changes quarter-over-quarter in the non-GAAP operating earnings per share by major business.<br/>Starting with PSE&amp;G. PSE&amp;G reported first quarter 2023 net income of $487 million or $0.98 per share compared to $509 million or $1.02 per share in the first quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 non-GAAP operating earnings were $492 million or $0.99 per share compared with $509 million or $1.01 per share in the first quarter of 2022. The main drivers for the quarter were the rate base additions from transmission and our Gas System Modernization Investment Programs, which were offset by the lower pension credits and the timing of taxes.<br/>Compared to the first quarter of 2022, transmission was $0.01 per share higher, GAAP margin was $0.01 per share higher, driven by $0.03 per share of favorable GSMP investment return that was partly offset by $0.01 per share of lower non-ship demand due to the warm weather and other margin items. Electric margin was flat compared to the first quarter of 2022, also reflecting the absence of favorable SIP through up in the year earlier quarter, partly offset by growth in the number of customers.<br/>Other electric and gas margin added $0.01 per share, reflecting both the earnings impact of the TAC or the tax adjustment credit and appliance service results. Lower distribution O&amp;M expense added $0.03 per share compared to the first quarter of 2022, primarily reflecting reduced weather-related corrective maintenance and gas maintenance costs. Both depreciation and interest expense increased by $0.01 per share compared to the first quarter of 2022, reflecting continued growth in investment.<br/>Lower pension credits reflecting 2022's investment returns resulted in a $0.04 per share unfavorable comparison to the year earlier quarter. The impact of PSEG's $500 million share repurchase program completed in May 2022, had a $0.01 per share benefit in the first quarter of 2023.<br/>Lastly, the timing of an effective tax rate adjustment and other flow-through taxes had a net unfavorable impact of $0.03 per share compared to the first quarter of 2022, but will reverse over the remainder of the year, driven by the use of an annual effective tax rate. The SIP mechanism in effect since 2021 limits the impact of weather and other sales variances, positive or negative on electric and gas margins, while enabling PSE&amp;G to promote the widespread adoption of its energy efficiency programs.<br/>Winter weather in the first quarter of 2023 was the warmest first quarter in PSE&amp;G's records. Measured by heating degree days, the first quarter of 2023 was 23% warmer than the first quarter of 2022 and 23% warmer than normal. The SIP mechanism allowed us to recover the impact of this extreme weather on sales. Growth in the number of electric and gas customers, the driver of margin under the SIP mechanism, continues to be positive and were each up 1% during the trailing 12-month period.<br/>PSE&amp;G invested $800 million during the first quarter and is on track to execute its planned 2023 capital investment program of $3.5 billion that includes infrastructure upgrades to its transmission and distribution facilities, Energy Strong II investments, last mile spend in the infrastructure advancement program and the continued rollout of the clean energy future investments in energy efficiency and the energy and cloud, including smart meters.<br/>For the full year 2023, PSE&amp;G's forecast of non-GAAP operating earnings is unchanged at $1.5 billion to $1.525 billion. Moving on to PSEG Power and Other, which includes our nuclear fleet, gas operations, Long Island and parent activities, including interest expense. For the first quarter of 2023, Power &amp; Other reported net income of $800 million or $1.60 per share and non-GAAP operating earnings of $203 million or $0.40 per share.<br/>This compares to first quarter 2022 net loss of $511 million or $1.02 per share and non-GAAP operating earnings of $163 million or $0.32 per share. We previously mentioned that PSEG Power would benefit from an approximate $4 per megawatt hour increase in the average price of our 2023 hedged output, which rose to approximately $31 per megawatt hour. The majority of this annual price improvement was realized during the first 3 months of the year with higher winter pricing driving most of the increase. And as a result, gross margin for the quarter rose by a total of $0.10 per share, driven primarily by a $0.17 per share increase from recontracting 8.4 terawatt hours of generation and market impacts from the step-up in power prices.<br/>The gross margin increase also includes lower capacity revenues of $0.02 per share and lower gas operations of $0.05 per share, reflecting lower capacity and natural gas prices during the first quarter of 2022. First quarter cost comparisons improved by $0.01 per share in 2023, reflecting lower nuclear costs and reduced spend on offshore wind activity versus 2022. Higher interest expense covering PSEG Power and parent financings were $0.04 per share unfavorable compared to the year ago quarter from refinancing maturing debt at higher rates.<br/>Lower pension credits from 2022 investment returns were $0.03 per share unfavorable versus the first quarter of 2022. Taxes and other were $0.04 per share favorable compared to the first quarter of 2022, reflecting the use of a lower effective tax rate in the quarter that will reverse over the balance of 2023, partly offset by lower investment income.<br/>On the operating side, the nuclear fleet produced approximately 8.4 terawatt hours during the first quarter of 2023, similar to the first quarter of 2022 and ran at a capacity factor of 100%.<br/>For the full year 2023, PSEG is forecasting a generation output of 30 to 32 terawatt hours and has hedged approximately 95% to 100% of this production at an average price of $31 per megawatt hour. For 2024, PSEG is again forecasting nuclear baseline output of 30 to 32 terawatt hours, and I said 75% to 80% of this output at an effective price of $37 per megawatt hour.<br/>Forecast non-GAAP operating earnings for PSEG Power and Other is unchanged at $200 million to $225 million for the full year. This forecast reflects the realization of a majority of the expected increase in the average 2023 annual hedge price in the first quarter of the year with minimal incremental pricing improvement compared to the prior year expected over the balance of 2023.<br/>Moving on to recent financing activity. As of March 31, 2023, PSEG had available credit capacity of $3.9 billion, including $1 billion at PSE&amp;G. In addition, PSEG had total cash and cash equivalents on hand of approximately $1.2 billion. PSEG Power had net cash collateral postings of $700 million at March 31, primarily related to out-of-the-money hedged positions resulting from higher energy prices. As these historical lower-priced trades continue to settle through 2023 and into 2024, collateral has returned as PSEG Power satisfies its obligations under those contracts.<br/>Thus far in 2023, collateral postings have been below the high levels experienced during 2022 and remained sub to market moves. Early in the first quarter, we prepaid $750 million of the $1.5 billion 364-day variable rate term loan due in April. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the remaining $750 million of the April 2023 term loan matured and was replaced by a new $750 million 364-day variable rate term loan maturing in April 2024.<br/>As of March 31, 2023, PSEG had outstanding a total of $1.25 billion of 364-day variable rate term loans expiring April and May of 2023 to support PSEG Power's collateral needs. And PSEG Power had outstanding a $1.25 billion variable rate term loan expiring in March 2025. In total, $1.05 billion of power and other variable debt has been swapped from variable rate to fixed as of March 31, 2023, with an additional $175 million swapped in April.<br/>Also in March, PSE&amp;G issued a total of $900 million of green bonds consisting of $500 million of secured medium-term notes due 2033 and $400 million of secured medium-term notes due 2053. As Ralph mentioned, we are reaffirming PSEG's 2023 non-GAAP operating earnings guidance of $3.40 to $3.50 per share, with regulated operations at PSE&amp;G forecasted to contribute $1.5 billion to $1.525 billion and PSEG Power and Other forecasted at $200 million to $225 million, noting that PSEG Power and Other has realized the majority of the expected annual price increase in recontracting during the first quarter of 2023. That concludes our formal remarks. And operator, we are ready to begin the question-and-answer session.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Operator Instructions)<br/>And our first question is from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.",
			"<strong>Shahriar Pourreza</strong>",
			"So first question is on just looking at maybe opportunities to efficiently finance. I know obviously, interest rate risk has been a headwind recently, but it's embedded in plan. You don't need equity, but do you feel like you have some opportunities for maybe financing efficiencies on the debt side, especially as we kind of see a very attractive cash pay convert market unfolding 5-year terms, low 3% costs. And could that sort of benefit be accretive to that 5% to 7% you guys reiterate today, especially since you do embed a higher interest rate cost step-up?",
			"<strong>Ralph A. LaRossa</strong>",
			"Yes. Shar, thanks for that. And I will give it to Dan in a second here. We're never going to walk away from an opportunity to save a few dollars, which is what you're referring to there. And so we wouldn't do that. I also think there's a fine line there that you have to watch from being too (inaudible) to being folks thinking that you're actually issuing equity. So I guess every one of those deals are different and we look at it and how it's structured, but we don't need to issue equity. And I just want to be certain that anything that we did to look at that would not be done in that light. So Dan, do you want to add?",
			"<strong>Daniel J. Cregg</strong>",
			"Yes, I think that's the right theme. Shar, we obviously are going to consider all options and we do on a regular basis when we try to look at how we finance the business. But I think it probably is a better fit for somebody who has an equity need coming up. But obviously, we would look at it the same way that we would look at anything else to make sure we're financing efficiently.",
			"<strong>Shahriar Pourreza</strong>",
			"Perfect. That was very clear. And then just lastly on the strategic side, it's obviously maybe a small upside. But do you have any sort of efficient ways to allocate proceeds for the lease sales if those occur? I mean there's been some activity on that front across the offshore wind players. So I wonder if you think it could be more accretive to hold on to some of those leases for a more competitive process and maybe more stable capital market environment there?",
			"<strong>Daniel J. Cregg</strong>",
			"Yes. I don't know that you can perfectly time the market. I do know that acreage that we do have is off the coast of Maryland, Maryland just upsized their targeted offshore when New Jersey [guessed] on the same. Those are, I think, probably the 2 markets that those acres would serve the best. And so I think you'd look at it from an operating perspective and from a market perspective, I should say, as to when you were going to execute on that sale.<br/>And when they come in, I think it's just going to be part of general corporate funds probably the most -- the quickest and most efficient way to use those funds would be a paydown of some debt and then just redeploying capital as we see need is. It's not like we're going to -- I guess, embedded within Ralph's comments, we're not selling parts of the business in addition to not issuing equity for what we need to do. And so it's not like that's going to be required from a timing perspective to do what we need to do to fund the capital plan. I think that's all sound. And I think it's just going to go back and be part of the overall financing plan.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore.",
			"<strong>Durgesh Chopra</strong>",
			"Just -- Dan, a quick clarification on the proceeds from the lease, that would be all incremental to the current CapEx plan, right? I just want to be clear on that account.",
			"<strong>Daniel J. Cregg</strong>",
			"Yes. It's -- and look, we shouldn't overplay the magnitude of what that's going to look like. It's going to be great, but it's not going to be life changing for the company as we go forward. It is a transaction that will be around the edges, and we'll do it. We want to make the most sense to make it the most efficient.",
			"<strong>Durgesh Chopra</strong>",
			"Okay. I didn't hear you mention the lift out on the pension on the call, sorry if I missed it. Can you just talk to that? What are the latest developments there? And is that still sort of something you're considering?",
			"<strong>Daniel J. Cregg</strong>",
			"Yes. I think, Durgesh, you didn't really hear anything because there really isn't nothing new to report, which is not to imply nothing's going on. Diligence does continue. It's something that we're continuing to explore just with the same purpose to dampen the volatility that we would have within the pension. And I think things are continuing productively. But there's nothing new to report but don't take the absence as if it's off the table, it remains something we're pursuing.",
			"<strong>Durgesh Chopra</strong>",
			"Got it. That's very clear. And then just one last one for me. Can you comment on how did the quarter shake out versus your expectations? And how does that position you for 2023 with respect to your guidance range?",
			"<strong>Ralph A. LaRossa</strong>",
			"Yes, Durgesh, it shook out exactly the way we expected it to. So we're -- that's why we're so certain about reaffirming guidance. I think what you also heard in a bunch of the answers that Dan just gave you was flexibility that we have. We're not -- none of the things that you're talking about are opportunities we have require us to thread a needle to execute the plan we have in front of us. And that confidence, I hope, comes across in both the way that we're answering and with the optionalities that we have.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.",
			"<strong>Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith</strong>",
			"Just following up on hedging and hedging strategy here post IRA. It seems like there's been a pretty nice step up here in hedged prices versus the fourth quarter deck, $37 megawatt hour versus $32. Can you talk about that? What drove the significantly higher price? Is there a change in how commercial activities are being characterized? Or is that actually a real step-up in economic value that you're showing there? I just want to make sure we're all clear about that.",
			"<strong>Ralph A. LaRossa</strong>",
			"Yes. And I'll give it to Dan to give you because he's got that trading operation, but I just do want to reinforce that a lot -- there's still some uncertainty out there in the out years until we get the [rolls] back from treasury. So what we are describing there, though, is what we expect to have. And Dan, you could fill some more details in there.",
			"<strong>Daniel J. Cregg</strong>",
			"Yes. Julien, I would -- what you're describing is not some kind of dramatic shift in what we're doing. We've always worked within a range across a ratable period. There are balance within that range. It's not a perfectly scientific range. So you could see some movement within a fairly bounded range for what we do. The quarter started with some higher prices, ended with an uptick and in the middle, had a drop off. And so I think that we did a nice job of capturing some decent pricing.<br/>The other thing I would say, though, that you don't want to lose sight of is that not everything is robotically across the year as well. So you can have some on peak, some off-peak hedges come on, you can have some winter hedges, some seasonal hedges, some calendar hedges come on and that can make a little bit of a difference as you go through quarter-to-quarter. It's a little bit of a granular look. So to your question, I do think that we did a nice job in moving forward and capturing some value. But I think some of the other things that I described also could come into play in any quarter frankly, I say that more generically as we quarter-to-quarter and you look at it granularly through time.",
			"<strong>Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith</strong>",
			"And just to clarify that commentary. So basically, this is more about hedging on peak versus off-peak than it is anything tied to IRA or otherwise. And again, you did a nice job commercially hedging, but you wouldn't necessarily say that this is anything in terms of a changed methodology importantly.",
			"<strong>Daniel J. Cregg</strong>",
			"You got that last part is the most important point that we said that we are kind of continuing on our path, similar methodology as what we've done in the past, pending the real update that is when we'll get that from treasury and understand it. My only comment is you can't take too much of a fine point because there are some nuances with the timing of hedges, whether they're on off peak and seasonal versus calendar hedges and things of that nature. But on balance, definitely a good quarter from a value perspective as we step through time.",
			"<strong>Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith</strong>",
			"Got it. And then super quick, if I can, you alluded to these plans that you're developing proposals for around electrification. When do you expect that to come? I know we've talked about this a bit in the past. Just what's the time line there? And then especially any thoughts about a parallel higher load forecast with that and the time line there?",
			"<strong>Ralph A. LaRossa</strong>",
			"Yes. So Julien, I think you're going to -- all of that's going to play out over the next 12 to 18 months on multiple fronts. First, we have to get agreement on that load forecast as you said, I continue to believe that the current load forecast that we see from PJM is light, not a big impact to us again because we are decoupled, which we've seen the benefit of this year. But I think that it will drive additional investments for us both potentially at the transmission level and at the distribution level, depending upon what -- where those forecasts levelize off that. There is a gap between our internal forecast on what PJM has, we provide that information. But PJM is the ultimate transmission authority from a planning standpoint.<br/>So we build our system out to that. I think there, though, as we get alignment on rates of EV turnover in the state of New Jersey as we get alignment on the electrification plans of the governor, and then as we get more alignment on this clean energy transition as a whole and specifically in regards to the offshore wind transmission, I think we'll be able to give you a little more guidance on that over the next 12 to 18 months.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Next question is from Travis Miller with Morningstar.",
			"<strong>Travis Miller</strong>",
			"I know it's really early in the process. But I wonder if you could characterize the discussion and issues that might come up on the GSMP III filing so far.",
			"<strong>Ralph A. LaRossa</strong>",
			"Sure, Travis. I think you said the key though, which is it's so early in the process right now. but we still don't have any red flags as far as what we've seen and in the conversations that we've had with the regulators. So we're confident at the end of the day that we'll get a similar run rate to what we have currently with our GSMP II filing. And I think you've heard and seen in all the comments made from the administration, specifically the governor's office that there's no intent to stop any gas installations.<br/>There's no intent at this point to stop stoves from being tied into gas. So it's a little bit different environment than we have. And I think that the lack of attention that it has had is also a very good indicator for all of us as to where policy will be heading in the state.",
			"<strong>Travis Miller</strong>",
			"So you're not taking anybody's stoves away.",
			"<strong>Ralph A. LaRossa</strong>",
			"Yes. No. I mean, there's no plan on that. And look, we got to be careful on all of this because that process is confidential, right? So we -- I think you can see from the newspaper articles and so on that there's really no challenge to us on the replacement of our facilities.",
			"<strong>Travis Miller</strong>",
			"Yes, just joking on that one. Perhaps I should have asked this first, but how early is it in the process? What kind of time line are you thinking about?",
			"<strong>Ralph A. LaRossa</strong>",
			"Yes. We usually talk about those things in the 12-month plus time line for filing like that, and I think we're only a couple of months into it yet. So they just named a presiding officer at the BPU for this filing. And so I think we're 12 months-plus away from early any decision.",

			"The next question is from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank.",
			"<strong>Andrew Marc Weisel</strong>",
			"First question on the new 4-year labor agreements. First of all, I'm glad you had more success than the Hollywood writers did. My question is given the inflationary pressures, how do the cost structures compared to prior deals? And how will that affect customer bills?",
			"<strong>Ralph A. LaRossa</strong>",
			"Yes. So Andrew, a couple of things there. Let me start backwards with the customer bills. I think there's been a few reports out that I just would encourage everybody take a look at New Jersey from '21 to '22 was I think, the fourth lowest state in the U.S. as far as residential electric rate increases. So the process here is working. It's not just what we do in the T&amp;D business, but it's also the way they procure power, and we've talked about that a bunch of times. So kudos to the BPU on that and the process that's been in place. And so we -- because of that rolling nature, any kind of increase that we would have is going to be minimal to start with.<br/>That said, our labor is a large component of our O&amp;M and the largest component of our O&amp;M expenses within the utility. So it will be a piece that goes into our rate case filing that we have. But the 4% increase that we were able to negotiate in 3 in the out years, it's just a good indication of the relationship that we have, the strong relationship that we have with our unions, all of our unions in the state.<br/>And the fact that in prior years when we had a 3% labor increase and inflation was at 1% to 2%, the unions recognized that, and the unions recognized now when inflation is higher than the 3% to 4%. They had some benefit in prior years. So I think the outcome is pretty flat, and it's flat from a growth standpoint for our folks because the good working relationships that we have and the way it plays out. At the end of the day, I don't think this will have a major impact on the rates, again, because of a number of different factors, so exactly what we expected and should give you some confidence and others on the call as to our O&amp;M projections in the out years because it is the biggest component of our expenses.",
			"<strong>Andrew Marc Weisel</strong>",
			"Great. That's very helpful. And yes, I know those negotiations are never easy. So congrats. Next question is on electric vehicles. Can you talk a little bit about how soon you expect to see the impact in terms of both infrastructure investment and higher residential demand? And then just remind me under the CIP decoupling mechanism, would you benefit with higher revenues as EVs pick up? Or would that be kind of more of an affordability story?",
			"<strong>Ralph A. LaRossa</strong>",
			"Yes. So a whole bunch in there. First of all, as far as timing goes, we are starting to see some new business requests come in. We see it in some of the Garden State Parkway rest stops. We're seeing in the New Jersey Turnpike rest stops. We're seeing it in some of the large commercial organizations that were just granted approval by the BPU that will install the charging infrastructure. So those -- that activity has started, and we're going to keep an eye on that and see about what kind of capital is required for each one of those installations on a stand-alone basis, help us in projections going forward, but it's just the start.<br/>As far as load increases and individual residences, we will know more about that as we deploy AMI. We have our AMI rollout going very well in New Jersey, and we'll have a lot more details that we can talk about, I would say, 12 months from now as far as when we start to see folks connecting their EVs that we had an engineer that worked here for -- just retired after about 60 years, and he said that he sees this transition as the transition when we went to central air conditioners back in the 1950s. So it will happen. It'll happen sporadically, and then it will take off just like that deployment took place. So we are -- we'll have more to say about it as we go forward, but I'm just really excited about the fact that we're starting to see it take place already in this first set of [trams] out from the BPU last week. So...",
			"<strong>Daniel J. Cregg</strong>",
			"On the affordability side of things, Andrew, too, I think that there will be infrastructure improvements that will need to be made that last mile of our system is pretty dated and there's a lot of work that will need to be done. But I think part of what you're going to see is a shift where a piece of the wallet that used to end up at the gas station is going to end up on the electric bill. That helps things as well.",
			"<strong>Ralph A. LaRossa</strong>",
			"And that's only for the commodity because, again, as you mentioned from the SIP, we're not going to collect any more for the pipes of the wires other than for what we deploy additional capital on so...",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question is from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock.",
			"<strong>Paul Patterson</strong>",
			"You mentioned the selection of the offer wind injection point. I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more what that actually might mean for you? If you could just elaborate a little bit more on that, I guess.",
			"<strong>Ralph A. LaRossa</strong>",
			"Yes, sure, Paul. So it wasn't a selection, it was a recommendation by the BPU to PJM to look at our Deans sub-switching station as the entry point. So what that could -- what it means for us certainly is that if PJM does agree with the Board of Public Utilities and does select that, any of the work inside the fence will be the responsibility of PSE&amp;G to complete inside the fence.<br/>The work outside fence will still follow under that state agreement approach and be a competitive solicitation. However, what I'm encouraged by is the fact that Deans is in our service territory. We know our service territory, and we should be very knowledgeable about the routes to get from the shore to that Deans substation. And I wouldn't go beyond that at this point, but I just -- I'm happy to see that these were selected. I also would tell you that I'm very happy about the work that we've done on our transmission system because the indication that, that gives us is that our transmission system is robust enough to take that injection of offshore wind generation into it. So we've done a nice -- our engineering team has done a really nice job of readying the system for what might come and here it is.",
			"<strong>Paul Patterson</strong>",
			"Is there any potential -- I guess when we talk about inside the fence, do you have any number about how much that might be?",
			"<strong>Ralph A. LaRossa</strong>",
			"No, Paul, I wouldn't know. We won't know until we actually see the size and magnitude of what comes in there versus down to the area JCP&amp;L just is rebuilding and maybe even some down in the electric territory. So a lot of flows to be figured out by PJM between now and then.",
			"<strong>Paul Patterson</strong>",
			"Okay. That's something to watch, I guess. Then with respect to the -- going from an 18-month fuel cycle to a 24-month fuel cycle, can you tell us what the potential impact of that might be, I guess, starting in 2025?",
			"<strong>Ralph A. LaRossa</strong>",
			"Well, from a capital expenditure standpoint, we -- I think we told you it was going to be around $30 million or so. It's about that same amount. So it's a very small number. What the impact will be is will be some savings in O&amp;M that we'll have as a result of that. And we're also obviously going to get additional megawatts. We have not -- I don't think we've published that anywhere yet. So I stay away from disclosing any of that information until we get the engineering completed, which is what that $30 million.<br/>There's really not a lot of work to do to actually ready of nuclear plant for this. What really has to be done is the engineering on the fuel rods and how they're going to interact with each other. And as that's completed, then we're going to tell what additional power we're going to get out of a unit.",

Or has the time line changed as you continue to work through the mechanics and details of how that would have all worked?",
			"<strong>Ralph A. LaRossa</strong>",
			"I'll give that one to Dan.",

			"Yes. right. There's really no change in schedule. I think it's -- we think about it as being a '23 event, but we'll continue to watch what's going on. We'll continue to watch the -- what the market looks for us, a large deal announced today on that front. So we'll make sure that as we do move forward, first and foremost, continuation of benefits and certainty around all that and all that diligence that we're going to do and that everything works well is going to be super important, but we'll also keep an eye on what the overall market conditions are to move forward on that.",
			"<strong>Ryan Michael Levine</strong>",

			"<strong>Ralph A. LaRossa</strong>",
			"Yes. What we referred to in the script was that the NRC has several PWR plants that are looking to change generic fuel cycle from 18 to 24 months. So we're monitoring that. What we had discussed in the past and what we're continuing to look at is the additional upgrades, which are different than the fuel cycle down at Salem. So more to come on that.

A follow up on Shar's question earlier on, I think, the thought of maybe using a hybrid maybe for financing, I guess. Are you guys forecasting additional debt at the parent to fund CapEx either at Power or utility?",
			"<strong>Daniel J. Cregg</strong>",
			"Yes. We gave a little bit of an indication in March on that, Anthony. At the parent, we'll see some debt levels come down as the existing collateral cycle kind of works off down to a more baseline amount of collateral. But then over time, we do expect as we continue to fund the capital plan that we have, we do anticipate some incremental financing over time. And so when Shar asked the question, is it something that we think of first and foremost as we're going to finance? No, we don't have equity needs as we go through the capital plan, but is it something that we would look at just to make sure we're not missing anything. I think that answers yes.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question is from the line of Ross Fowler with UBS.",
			"<strong>Ross A. Fowler</strong>",
			"I'll echo the congratulations Devils and my [brews] laid a big egg. So they cleared the way for you for sure. So most of my questions have been answered. Just maybe a couple for you, Dan. So customer growth came in pretty good in the quarter, tracking around 1%. Can you just kind of remind us what the SIP, what you've assumed for customer growth in your go-forward earnings growth guidance?",
			"<strong>Daniel J. Cregg</strong>",
			"Yes, less than -- between 0% and 1% is kind of the range that we've assumed for customer growth over time. And again, that's a number of customers, that's the important element for us, right?",
			"<strong>Ross A. Fowler</strong>",
			"Right, right. And then there was this $0.10 of expected tax carryback in your walk from '22 to '23, but that ended up coming in, in 2022? So what other things are now sort of in 2023, given the absence of that $0.10 that gets you back to sort of '23 guidance rating?",
			"<strong>Daniel J. Cregg</strong>",
			"Yes, it's a great question. And it -- that $0.10 was not entirely the carryback that was the biggest chunk of it. And so that did come in early. What we're seeing in '23 really that offsets some of that without going through a whole bunch of puts and takes with respect to the guidance, which is still in the same place it was last quarter in some of the lower collateral driving lower interest, which is a little bit of a tailwind. So a headwind from the former, a tailwind from the latter, and we're still in the same place from an overall guidance perspective.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question is from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research.",
			"<strong>Michael P. Sullivan</strong>",
			"Just wanted to circle back to the offshore wind transmission opportunity and solicitation next year. I guess like how should we think about the read-through from the first go around. And I think the fact that it came on shore in JCP&amp;L's territory and the fact that they got most of the opportunity there. Should we take that as a read-through within the Deans substation?",
			"<strong>Ralph A. LaRossa</strong>",
			"Yes. No, Michael. I think, look, the fact that, that work was awarded to JCP&amp;L just indicated that they had some work to do to make that system more robust to catch the power coming in, to use an analogy there. What you're hearing now is that the work that we have been doing at Deans has readied our system already. So we're in a little better place from a readiness standpoint at Deans. And I think that you're now seeing the BPU executing on what they had originally said from the beginning, which was saying, we want to come into the southern part of the state, the central part of the state and the northern part of the state.<br/>And our Deans substation, switching station, allows them to execute on that plan.",
			"<strong>Michael P. Sullivan</strong>",
			"Okay. That's very helpful. And then just in terms of the time line, for any spend related to this solicitation next year...",
			"<strong>Ralph A. LaRossa</strong>",
			"Yes. It's all under the decade, Michael. We've been saying from the beginning, they'll go through the solicitation process. Again, they're still waiting for treasury as well to figure out the tax rules. Once they get there, we'll determine what's going to be transmission, what's going to be generator leads, and we'll be off to the races at that point. But that still puts us at the end of the decade before anyone is deploying capital on this.",
			"<strong>Michael P. Sullivan</strong>",
			"Okay. That's very helpful. One quick one back to the quarter on the electric and gas margin, I just wanted to make sure I understood correctly the impact that was not covered by the SIP, what was that related to?",
			"<strong>Daniel J. Cregg</strong>",
			"So I think we said in March, there's about 95% of our overall revenues covered by the SIP and there is some component that is not. And so we do have some variability, albeit much more on the smaller end. I think the variance you're talking about was $0.01. So it was not a significant amount, but there is some element that falls outside of some of the larger customers, that's all.",

			"<strong>Agnieszka Anna Storozynski</strong>",
			"So I know you guys covered this in detail during the Analyst Day, but I still want to ask a question about the future of your nuclear plants. And so you talked about the assets being an important source of cash to finance the growth of the utility that you wanted to do upgrades at the assets and you were waiting for more guidance from (inaudible) around nuclear PTCs. So my question is, so is it just a question of timing in the sense that you're not ready yet to separate these assets or maybe there is no easy way to separate these assets without any tax leakage? So it could still come in the future? Or is it just a long-term strategy that you plan to stick with these assets and you hope that investors will value them at least the PTC-backed earnings as regulated like?",
			"<strong>Ralph A. LaRossa</strong>",
			"Yes, Angie, I was trying to be as clear as possible at that investor meeting. We want to and expect to keep those assets in our portfolio. I don't see any scenario that we've been presented with that would make us waver from that. And so I just want to be as clear as I can, crisp as I can beyond that.<br/>You laid out exactly upfront, all the reasons why we articulated and I stand by that today as to why we're keeping those plants. They are a great cash flow. They've been run really, really well, and they continue to run really well. And so when you have that operating excellence combined with the cash flow, it does create a very unique utility-like revenue stream for us that we think differentiates us from some of our peers. And hopefully, across the board today, you're seeing that differentiation. And hard to think of a more valuable asset in these times, Angie.",
			"<strong>Agnieszka Anna Storozynski</strong>",
			"Yes. I mean I don't disagree. And then lastly, so we're waiting for that guidance on nuclear PTCs, and it sounds like it's only going to come in the fourth quarter. Do you just have any like what is the main question mark here? What is it? Is it about below-market hedges if those are going to get recognized in that true-up associated with the nuclear PTC. I'm just wondering what is it that we're really waiting for?",
			"<strong>Ralph A. LaRossa</strong>",
			"Yes. And I'll give it to Dan to give you some more details on this. But look, at the very high level, it's the definition of revenues. And how that's going to be treated by treasury, but Dan can give you a lot more.",
			"<strong>Daniel J. Cregg</strong>",
			"Yes. I mean just the mechanics of how it works, Angie, I'm sure you know, is there's a calculation of gross receipts. I'm in a comparison to what the PTC threshold is and the credit kind of fills that gap. And so how that definition is determined. And you went to exactly some of the areas that I would reference. And how do you treat hedges? Is it a spot price? Is it some kind of an assumption around what hedges have happened? Is it actual hedges? It's just -- it's unclear exactly how they will define the gross receipts in order to figure out how you move from that amount to the PTC threshold.<br/>And so that's what we're waiting on. I think at the end of the day, we'll get a reasonable answer. And I think that there's a significant support for what's there. And I think we just got to work -- treasury has got to work their way through what's going to make the sense across units that are in various situations across the country.",
			"<strong>Agnieszka Anna Storozynski</strong>",
			"Okay. And then lastly, so we've heard from constellation, for example, that they are thinking about replacing some of the state support for their nuclear plants with those federal subsidies. In your case, I'm just thinking about it. So the 20 -- sort of nuclear PTCs would accrue in 2024, but you would collect them only in '25. So New Jersey expire in May of '25. So is it fair to assume that it's unlikely that there would be any changes in the current structure given that, again, the payments roughly coincide with the exploration period for the transacts?",
			"<strong>Daniel J. Cregg</strong>",
			"Yes. I think those mechanics are still ahead of us to be worked out. But I do think -- look, I think that all along, one of the things that we were saying that was so, so important is that we had a long-term solution for nuclear. And I think that we were very happy to see that the PTCs did create that, and honestly, did create that at the federal level.<br/>And so if you think about most of the other elements that support renewable energy are the types of things through ITCs and PTCs that ultimately are funded at the federal level. And so that's another element that I think is very important within this, and that's what we'll end up moving towards once the PTC amount start to kick.",

			"<strong>Ralph A. LaRossa</strong>",
			"Yes. Thanks. So listen, I appreciate everyone getting on. I appreciate the robust questions. I just leave you again with what we've been saying ad nauseam at this point, but predictability and stability and confidence.<br/>And I think that all 3 of those things have come across again today in both our results and hopefully in our Q&amp;A. We're proud of the organization we've got here. We're proud of the results that we've been able to achieve, and we're just trying to build on 120 years of great history that we've been able to inherit. And as we've said multiple, multiple times, we want to leave it better than we found it. So thank you for calling in, and I appreciate the time.",

			"ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland and Labrador, May 03, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fortis Inc. (\"Fortis\" or the \"Corporation\") (TSX/NYSE: FTS), a well-diversified leader in the North American regulated electric and gas utility industry, released its first quarter results<sup>1</sup>.<br/>",
			"<strong>Highlights </strong>",
			"\"Our strong first quarter results reflect the diversified nature of our business and the continued delivery of our low-risk capital plan,\" said David Hutchens, President and Chief Executive Officer, Fortis. \"With capital expenditures of $1.0 billion in the quarter, we are on track to invest $4.3 billion in our systems this year.\"",
			"\"Our funding plan remains intact, and the sale of the Aitken Creek Natural Gas Storage Facility further strengthens our balance sheet and supports financing of our regulated utility investments,\" said Mr. Hutchens. \"We remain confident in our growth strategy as we continue to provide value to shareholders while executing on the transition to a cleaner energy future and delivering safe, reliable and affordable service to our customers.\"",
			"<strong>Net Earnings</strong><br/>The Corporation reported net earnings attributable to common equity shareholders (\"Net Earnings\") of $437 million for the first quarter, or $0.90 per common share, compared to $350 million, or $0.74 per common share in the first quarter of 2022. The increase reflected rate base growth, mainly at ITC and the western Canadian utilities, as well as higher earnings at UNS Energy. Market conditions resulted in wholesale electricity sales with favourable margin and higher transmission revenue at UNS Energy in the first quarter of 2023 compared to later quarters in 2022. Higher retail electricity sales, including the impact of favourable weather, and lower depreciation expense associated with the retirement of the San Juan generating station in June 2022, also contributed to results in Arizona.",
			"Results for the quarter also reflected higher earnings at Aitken Creek, an increase in the market value of investments that support retirement benefits at UNS Energy and ITC, and a higher U.S.-to-Canadian dollar foreign exchange rate. Growth in earnings was partially offset by higher holding company finance costs.",
			"An increase in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, largely associated with the Corporation's dividend reinvestment plan, also impacted earnings per share for the quarter.",
			"<strong>A</strong><strong>djusted Net Earnings</strong><sup><strong>2</strong></sup><br/>Adjusted net earnings attributable to common equity shareholders (\"Adjusted Net Earnings\") excludes the impact of mark-to-market accounting of natural gas derivatives at Aitken Creek. Adjusted Net Earnings of $439 million for the first quarter, or $0.91 per common share, were $70 million, or $0.13 per common share higher than the same period in 2022. The increase was driven by the same factors discussed for Net Earnings.",
			"<br/>",
			"<strong><br/>Capital Expenditures </strong>",
			"Fortis' $4.3 billion annual capital plan remains on track with $1.0 billion invested through March 2023.",
			"The Corporation's major capital projects continue to progress. In March 2023, FortisBC Energy filed amended transportation rate schedules with the British Columbia Utilities Commission (\"BCUC\") for the Eagle Mountain Woodfibre Gas Line project. Approval from the BCUC is anticipated in May 2023, which will remove certain of FortisBC Energy's conditions for commencing construction and bring the project one step closer to construction.",
			"The first tranche of approved projects associated with the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (\"MISO\") long-range transmission plan (\"LRTP\") are advancing at ITC with stakeholder outreach, routing studies and design engineering underway. ITC estimates transmission investments of US$1.4 billion to US$1.8 billion through 2030 associated with six of the 18 LRTP projects.",
			"<strong>Regulatory Updates</strong>",
			"In March 2023, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission confirmed its decision to deny the complaint filed by the Iowa Coalition for Affordable Transmission requesting that ITC Midwest's common equity component of capital structure be reduced.",
			"In March 2023, the Iowa Supreme Court granted standing to certain plaintiffs to challenge the right of first refusal (\"ROFR\") available to incumbent electric transmission owners in Iowa. The court also issued a temporary injunction staying enforcement of the ROFR statute, and remanded the matter to the District Court to decide the merits of the claim. Management does not believe that this proceeding will impact projects at ITC that have already been approved and are under development, including Tranche 1 projects associated with the MISO LRTP. The timing of this proceeding and any impact on future projects, is unknown.",
			"In April 2023, hearings concluded on the Tucson Electric Power general rate application, which seeks new customer rates effective September 1, 2023 using a December 31, 2021 test year. While the timing and outcome of this proceeding is unknown, a recommended order and opinion from the administrative law judge is expected mid-year.",
			"The generic cost of capital proceeding in British Columbia, which includes a review of the common equity component of capital structure and the rate of return on common equity for FortisBC, continues to progress as expected with a decision expected by mid-2023.",
			"<strong><br/>Pending Sale of Unregulated Asset</strong><br/>On May 1, 2023, the Corporation announced that FortisBC Holdings Inc. had entered into a definitive share purchase and sale agreement with a subsidiary of Enbridge Inc. to sell its 93.8% ownership interest in the Aitken Creek Natural Gas Storage Facility for approximately $400 million, subject to customary closing conditions and adjustments. The purchase is subject to required approval, principally by the BCUC, and is expected to close by the end of the year with a March 31, 2023 effective date. Net proceeds from the transaction will further strengthen the balance sheet and support financing of the Corporation's regulated utility growth strategy.",
			"<strong>Outlook</strong><br/>Fortis continues to enhance shareholder value through the execution of its capital plan, the balance and strength of its diversified portfolio of regulated utility businesses, and growth opportunities within and proximate to its service territories. While energy price volatility, global supply chain constraints and persistent inflation are issues of potential concern that continue to evolve, the Corporation does not currently expect there to be a material impact on its operations or financial results in 2023.",
			"Fortis is executing on the transition to a cleaner energy future and is on track to achieve its corporate-wide targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (\"GHG\") by 50% by 2030 and 75% by 2035. Upon achieving these targets, 99% of the Corporation's assets will support energy delivery and renewable, carbon-free generation. The Corporation's additional 2050 net-zero direct GHG emissions target reinforces Fortis' commitment to further decarbonize over the long-term, while preserving customer reliability and affordability.",
			"The Corporation's $22.3 billion five-year capital plan is expected to increase midyear rate base from $34.1 billion in 2022 to $46.1 billion by 2027, translating into a five-year compound annual growth rate of 6.2%<sup>5</sup>.",
			"Beyond the five-year capital plan, additional opportunities to expand and extend growth include: further expansion of the electric transmission grid in the U.S. to facilitate the interconnection of cleaner energy, including infrastructure investments associated with the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and the MISO LRTP; climate adaptation and grid resiliency investments; renewable gas solutions and liquefied natural gas infrastructure in British Columbia; and the acceleration of cleaner energy infrastructure investments across our jurisdictions.",
			"Fortis expects its long-term growth in rate base will drive earnings that support dividend growth guidance of 4-6% annually through 2027, and is premised on the assumptions and material factors listed under \"Forward-Looking Information\".",
			"<strong>About Fortis</strong><br/>Fortis is a well-diversified leader in the North American regulated electric and gas utility industry with 2022 revenue of $11 billion and total assets of $65 billion as at March 31, 2023. The Corporation's 9,200 employees serve utility customers in five Canadian provinces, ten U.S. states and three Caribbean countries.",

			"This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4.81%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this electric power provider would post earnings of $1.08 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.14, delivering a surprise of 5.56%.",
			"Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.",
			"Edison International , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, posted revenues of $3.97 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.53%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.97 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.",

			"There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.",
			"Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.",
			"Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Edison International: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

Our management uses core earnings and core earnings per share (EPS) internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance of Edison International and Southern California Edison. We also use core earnings and core EPS when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the Company’s performance from period to period. Financial measures referred to as net income, basic EPS, core earnings, or core EPS also apply to the description of earnings or earnings per share.",

Core earnings and core EPS are defined as basic earnings and basic EPS excluding income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings. Basic earnings and losses refer to net income or losses attributable to Edison International shareholders. Core earnings are reconciled to basic earnings in the attached tables. The impact of participating securities (vested awards that earn dividend equivalents that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock) for the principal operating subsidiary is not material to the principal operating subsidiary’s EPS and is therefore reflected in the results of the Edison International holding company, which is included in Edison International Parent and Other.",

			"The Zacks Utilities sector’s first-quarter earnings are expected to have benefited from a revival of demand in the commercial and industrial groups of customers, and an increase in the efficiency of services. However, mild weather conditions during the period may have had an adverse effect on demand.<br/><br/>Per the latest Earnings Preview, the Zacks Utilities sector’s first-quarter 2023 earnings are expected to decline 4.7% while revenues are estimated to improve 7.2%. The capital-intensive utility stocks were impacted by the ongoing increase in interest rates, but new rates implemented in their service territories and customer growth boosted profits.",
			"Domestic-focused companies operating in the sector are devoted to cost management and implementing energy-efficiency programs. New rates and customer additions are creating fresh demand for utilities. Investment in strengthening the infrastructure is allowing utilities to provide services 24X7, leading to stable earnings. Moreover, the players are insulated from the adverse impact of currency fluctuation. The utilities are likely to have gained from these favorable conditions in the January-March period.<br/><br/>The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) should support and accelerate the utilities' transition toward clean energy sources. IRA has removed the uncertainties relating to federal incentives provided for renewable sources usage. The act entails opportunities for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions in a predictable way for a long time and would create earnings visibility.<br/><br/>However, utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations, and are capital-intensive in nature. The performance of the utilities is likely to have been adversely impacted by the increase in interest rates from near-zero levels. The increase in borrowing costs in 2022 is expected to continue in 2023 and may have pushed up capital servicing expenses and reduced net income in the first quarter.<br/><br/>According to the Zacks model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br/><br/>You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.<br/><br/><strong>Eversource Energy</strong>’s ES results are expected to benefit from new rates that became effective during the last quarter of 2022 and contributions from transmission assets.

			"Duke Energy (DUK) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.",
			"The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 9. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.",
			"While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.",
			"<b>Zacks Consensus Estimate</b>",
			"This electric utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.31 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +0.8%.",
			"Revenues are expected to be $7.32 billion, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.",
			"<b>Estimate Revisions Trend</b>",
			"The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.43% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.",
			"Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.",
			"<b>Earnings Whisper</b>",
			"Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.",
			"The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.",
			"Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.",
			"A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",
			"Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).",
			"<b>How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Duke Energy?</b>",
			"For Duke Energy, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.",
			"On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.",
			"So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Duke Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate.",
			"<b>Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?</b>",
			"While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.",
			"For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Duke Energy would post earnings of $1.06 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.11, delivering a surprise of +4.72%.",
			"Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.",
			"<b>Bottom Line</b>",
			"An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.",
			"That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.",
			"Duke Energy doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.",
			"<b>An Industry Player's Expected Results</b>",
			"Among the stocks in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, Alliant Energy (LNT) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.73 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -5.2%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.12 billion, up 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.",
			"Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Alliant Energy has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.",
			"This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Alliant Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.",
			"Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.",

			"<strong>Unidentified Company Representative:</strong> Thank you, Vishnavi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2023 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are John Ketchum, Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Kirk Crews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy. All of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners as well as Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power &amp; Light Company. Kirk will provide an overview of our results and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.",
			"We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements, if any of our key assumptions are incorrect, or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Each of which can be found on our websites www.nexteraenergy.com and www.nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures.",
			"You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that I will turn the call over to Kirk.",
			"<strong>Kirk Crews:</strong> Thank you, Kristen, and good morning everyone. NextEra Energy is off to a strong start in 2023. Adjusted earnings per share increased by approximately 13.5% year-over-year building on the success of last year's strong execution and financial performance. During the quarter, we were honored that NextEra Energy was again ranked number one in our sector on Fortune's list of the world's most admired companies for the 16th time in 17 years. We are extremely proud of the team and culture we have built that has enabled us to deliver low-cost clean and reliable power to our customers, while also providing long-term value to our shareholders. FPL is the largest electric utility in the US and Florida is now officially the fastest-growing state in America.",
			"At FPL, our focus remains the same deploying smart capital to deliver on what we believe is one of the best customer value propositions in our industry. Key to that strategy is keeping customer bills affordable. And this quarter, we proposed using projected 2023 fuel savings to reduce unbilled fuel costs from 2022 to provide bill relief to customers. To further manage fuel price volatility, we are also helping customers by adding more solar to the FPL grid. This quarter, we placed into service approximately 970 megawatts of new low-cost solar. Putting FPL's owned and operated solar portfolio at nearly 4,600 megawatts, which is the largest solar portfolio of any utility in the country. We believe solar is now the lowest cost generation option for Florida customers, but represents only about 5% of FPL's delivered energy.",
			"In order to extend the benefits of low-cost solar to customers, FPL's recently filed 10-year site plan, now includes nearly 20,000 megawatts of new solar. Energy Resources, the world's leader in renewables and a leader in battery storage, remains laser-focused on executing a strategy of decarbonizing the power sector and helping commercial and industrial customers outside the power sector, reduce their energy cost and decarbonize their operations by moving to low-cost renewables and other clean energy solutions. This quarter, Energy Resources added approximately 2,020 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects to its backlog. Energy Resources also closed on its previously announced acquisition of a large portfolio of operating landfill gas-to-electric facilities, providing the foundation for our growing RNG business.",
			"We are also excited to announce a new memorandum of understanding with CF Industries to create green hydrogen, establishing what we expect will be a long-term relationship with the world's largest ammonium producer. And finally, Energy Resources continues to build what we believe is the nation's leading competitive transmission business to help support growth in renewables. We are pleased to announce that the California ISO recently recommended for approval approximately $400 million in new transmission and substation upgrades for NextEra Energy Transmission. We believe, NextEra Energy continues to be anchored by two great businesses that leverage each other's expertise to make them even better. We do not believe anyone in our industry has our set of skills, scale and breadth of opportunities.",
			"We believe NextEra Energy is able to buy, build operate and finance cheaper with one of the strongest balance sheets in our sector. We also believe our best-in-class development skills and unparalleled data set enable us to provide innovative technology and low-cost clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers. The opportunities and products demanded by the market are becoming more complex, requiring significant scale and a combination of skills that we believe few of our competitors can offer, further enhancing our competitive advantages and creating even more growth opportunities for our business going forward. We have a culture rooted and continuous improvement, always striving to be better. Along those lines, we just completed our annual employee-led productivity initiative, which we now call Velocity.",
			"Ikonoklast Fotografie/Shutterstock.com",
			"For over 11 years, our employees have generated approximately $2.6 billion in annual run rate savings ideas, as part of this process. In 2023 alone, our team generated ideas expected to produce roughly $325 million in annual run rate savings, which when combined with last year's results of over $400 million is the most productive two-year period in this program's history and that's after doing it for over a decade. We believe we have the best team in the industry, and these results are indicative of the breadth and depth of capabilities and the commitment to excellence that our team brings to our business every day and executing on behalf of our customers and shareholders. With that let's turn to the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the first quarter of 2023, FPL reported net income of $1.07 billion, or $0.53 per share an increase of $0.09 year-over-year.",
			"Regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 11.2% was a significant driver of FPL's EPS growth versus the prior year comparable quarter. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.3 billion for the quarter. We expect our full year 2023 capital investments at FPL to be between $8.0 billion and $9.0 billion, as we continue to invest capital smartly for the continued benefit of our customers. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8% for the 12 months ending March 2023. During the quarter, we utilized $373 million of reserve amortization to achieve our targeted regulatory ROE leaving FPL with a balance of $1.07 billion. As we've previously discussed, FPL historically utilizes more reserve amortization in the first half of the year, and we expect this trend to continue this year.",
			"Earlier this year, the Florida Public Service Commission approved FPL's proposed plan to recover approximately $2.1 billion of incremental fuel costs from 2022 partially offset by projected 2023 fuel savings of approximately $1.4 billion. Amid high natural gas prices in 2022, FPL's decades-long modernization of its generation fleet has saved customers more than $2 billion in fuel costs in 2022 alone. The commission also recently approved recovery of approximately $1.3 billion of hurricane costs from 2022 over a 12-month period. Taking all approved adjustments together, we anticipate that FPL's typical 1,000 kilowatt hour residential customer bills will remain well below the projected national average and among the lowest of all Florida utilities.",
			"Turning to our development planning and efforts. FPL recently filed its annual 10-year site plan that presents our generation resource plan for the next decade. The 2023 plan includes roughly 20,000 megawatts of new low-cost solar capacity across our service territory over the next 10 years, which would result in nearly 35% of FPL's forecasted energy delivery in 2032 coming from cost-effective solar generation up significantly from roughly 5% in 2022. Given the increasing customer benefits of low-cost renewables FPL's post-2025 solar capacity additions and this year's plan are more than double last year's approved plan and also includes 2 gigawatts of battery storage over the next decade. We believe the expansion of cost-effective solar and storage will provide a valuable hedge for our customers against volatile natural gas prices and meet the electricity demand of FPL's growing customer base with a low-cost generation source.",
			"Finally, construction of our green hydrogen pilot at our Okeechobee Clean Energy Center is on track and projected to go into service later this year. Turning now to the Florida economy. Florida became the fastest-growing state in the nation in 2022 and its population continues to increase with over 1,000 people moving to Florida every day. Over the last five years, Florida's GDP has grown at a roughly 7% compound annual growth rate and is now approximately $1.4 trillion which is up approximately 8% versus a year ago. Based on GDP, if Florida was a country, it would have the 14th largest economy in the world. FPL's first quarter retail sales increased 0.4% from the prior year comparable period driven by continued solid underlying population growth with FPL's average number of customers increasing by approximately 65,000, even after removing roughly 15,000 inactive customers due to Hurricane Ian.",
			"For the first quarter, we estimate that the positive impact of warmer weather was more than offset by a decline in underlying usage for our customers. As we have often pointed out, underlying usage can be somewhat volatile on a quarterly basis, particularly during periods when temperatures deviate significantly from normal, as we experienced this winter with average temperatures greater than four degrees above normal. Our long-term expectations of underlying usage growth continues to average between zero and approximately negative 0.5% per year. Energy Resources report first quarter 2023 GAAP earnings of approximately $1.440 billion or $0.72 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $732 million or $0.36 per share up $0.04 versus the prior year comparable period.",
			"Contributions from new investments increased $0.07 per share year-over-year. Contributions from our existing Clean Energy portfolio were lower by $0.03 per share primarily due to less favorable wind and solar resource compared to the prior year. The contribution from our customer supply and trading business increased by $0.06 per share primarily due to higher margin in our customer-facing business and compared to a relatively weaker contribution in the prior year comparable quarter. Gas infrastructure and all other impacts reduced earnings by $0.01 and $0.05 per share respectively versus 2022. Energy Resources had another strong quarter of origination capitalizing on strong global demand environment. Since the last call, we added approximately 2020 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects to our backlog including roughly 1370 megawatts of solar, 450 megawatts of storage and 200 megawatts of wind.",
			"With these additions, our renewables and storage backlog now stands at over 20.4 gigawatts net of projects placed in service and provides strong visibility into our future growth. With more than 1.5 years remaining before the end of 2024, we are now within the 2023 to 2024 development expectations range. Given the volatility in gas and power prices over the last 1.5 years, we continue to see economics driving long-term decision-making and renewables remain the clear low-cost option for many customers. On the supply -- solar supply chain front, we continue to take constructive steps to mitigate potential future disruption. Nearly every one of our suppliers has repositioned their supply chains to manufacture solar panels in Southeast Asia using wafers and cells produced outside of China, and all our suppliers are expected to meet the criteria established in the Commerce Department's preliminary determination in the 2022 circumvention case by the end of 2023.",
			"Additionally, we are focused on further diversifying our supply chain and are currently advancing discussions to support the domestic production of solar panels. Finally, we are encouraged by the improvement in the flow of panels into the US as suppliers continue to provide the requested traceability documentation to US Customs and Border Protection. Also, during the quarter, we closed on the previously announced transaction to acquire a large portfolio of operating landfill gas-to-electric facilities that I mentioned earlier. The approximately $1.1 billion transaction represents an attractive opportunity for energy resources to realize double-digit returns on this investment, while expanding its portfolio of renewable natural gas assets and growing its in-house capabilities and rapidly expanding renewable fuel market.",
			"Turning to green hydrogen, we are excited about the role it is expected to play as a solution to help our customers cost effectively lower emissions. As the world leader in renewables and a leader in battery storage, we believe we are the logical partner for green hydrogen with significant interconnection and land inventory positions and deep market expertise to help our potential partners optimize some of the best green hydrogen sites around the country. As a result, with the right regulation, we see hydrogen quickly becoming a significant technology for our customers and a new growth driver for energy resources given the number and size of the opportunities we are evaluating. Earlier this month, NextEra Energy joined a coalition of 45 other companies with a combined approximately $1 trillion in market capitalization and sending a letter to the Secretaries of Energy &amp; Treasury and the White House advocating for programmatic policies for the implementation of the IRAs green hydrogen production tax credit.",
			"This coalition is advocating for prudent policy that will foster investment in green hydrogen technology paving the way for the US to become the world leader in hydrogen technology. A key aspect of this policy is for the electricity consumed for green hydrogen production to be matched to its renewable power generation on an annual rather than an hourly basis. We believe that an annual matching construct has several benefits over hourly including lower green hydrogen prices, more renewables being built, a significant reduction in carbon emissions, and green hydrogen achieving cost parity with gray and blue hydrogen both of which rely on fossil fuels for their production. This viewpoint is supported by numerous third-party studies from respected entities such as Wood Mackenzie, Rhodium Group, Energy Futures Initiative, Energy and Environmental Economics, and MIT Energy Institute.",
			"As we continue to work with the industry and government representatives to progress a smart hydrogen policy, we are also advancing our green hydrogen development efforts including a recently executed Memorandum of Understanding for a joint venture with CF Industries, the world's largest producer of ammonia to develop -- to deliver green hydrogen to an existing CF Industries ammonia production facility which it intends to expand and incorporate green hydrogen into its production process. The proposed facility includes an approximately 450-megawatt renewable energy solution, powering a 40 tons per day hydrogen facility. This project combined with other opportunities we are pursuing represent significant momentum for green hydrogen, which we believe will continue to be a driver of new renewables growth going forward.",
			"Our team continues to engage with multiple potential partners and customers on hydrogen projects, representing over $20 billion of capital investments and requiring more than 15 gigawatts of new renewables to support. As we focus on leading the decarbonization of the US economy, building additional transmission is essential to support long-term renewables deployment. We believe our ability to build, own and operate transmission as a key competitive advantage for our renewables business, in addition to being a terrific investment opportunity. We are pleased that the California ISO recently recommended for approval of approximately $400 million in transmission and substation upgrades for NextEra Energy Transmission, subject to approval by the CAISO Board of Governors in May.",
			"We believe these projects along with others could unlock up to 11 gigawatts of new renewable generation that could be built to support California's ambitious clean energy goals. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the first quarter of 2023 GAAP earnings attributable to NextEra Energy were $2.086 billion or $1.04 per share. NextEra Energy's 2023 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were approximately $1.678 billion and $0.84 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings for the Corporate and Other segment decreased results by $0.03 per share year-over-year, primarily driven by higher interest rates. In March, S&amp;P affirmed all its ratings for NextEra Energy and lowered its downgrade threshold for its funds from operations or FFO to debt metric from the previous level of 20% to the current level of 18%.",
			"In making this favorable adjustment, S&amp;P acknowledged improvement in Energy Resources business risk following the passage of the IRA, particularly noting the improved visibility and clarity into long-term cash flows. At the same time, S&amp;P adjusted its treatment of non-recourse project debt associated with FERC Regulated investments to bring it back on credit. We believe this overall favorable adjustment, which creates roughly 50 bps of additional headroom against the downgrade threshold, highlights the attractive risk profile of renewables and acknowledges the long-term stable cash flows and Energy Resources business, particularly given the benefits of the IRA. Finally as we have discussed in the past, we actively enter into various interest rate swaps products to manage interest rate exposure on future debt issuance.",
			"Today, we have $21 billion of interest rate swaps at NextEra Energy to help mitigate the impact of potential future increases in rates, which exceeds the notional value of our 2023 and 2024 maturities. And as always, the current interest rate environment is taken into account in our financial expectations. Our long-term financial expectations which we extended earlier this year through 2026 remain unchanged. And we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges in each year from 2023 to 2026, while at the same time maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. From 2021 to 2026, we also continue to expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range.",
			"We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2024 off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats including normal weather and operating conditions. Turning to NextEra Energy Partners. We believe, we have never had more visible growth opportunities than we have today. We have the ability to grow in three ways: acquiring assets from Energy Resources, growing organically and buying assets from other third parties. With significant tailwinds from the IRA, Energy Resources' operating portfolio, combined with its backlog of projects and development expectations through 2026, total approximately 58 gigawatts, providing terrific visibility for NextEra Energy Partners and Energy Resources is continuing to grow in innovative ways, adding new technologies and clean energy assets to its portfolio, such as RNG and hydrogen.",
			"In addition to acquiring assets from Energy Resources, NextEra Energy Partners also has the ability to repower its existing assets, with approximately 1,300 megawatts of potential wind repowerings, already identified, and many more opportunities expected to come, as well as potential to locate storage at its existing renewable assets, given the new stand-alone storage ITC. Finally, there are significant acquisition opportunities with renewable portfolios, continuously being brought to market. NextEra Energy Partners also has numerous ways that can finance this growth and we believe, it can do so efficiently, given its ample liquidity and access to capital. At the end of the first quarter, NextEra Energy Partners had $2.8 billion of liquidity and approximately $6 billion of interest rate swaps to manage future interest rate volatility on debt maturities through 2026.",
			"With regard to convertible equity portfolio financing, we can fund equity buyouts by delivering common units or utilizing our at-the-market or ATM program or a combination of both and we believe we have ample liquidity to fund cash payments. Importantly, we have flexibility and we expect to leverage this flexibility to manage future buyouts to select the most efficient option. Using this flexibility, NextEra Energy Partners has now bought out 50% of the STX Midstream convertible equity portfolio financing through funds generated from a combination of the ATM program, where NextEra Energy Partners was able to be opportunistic and cash from a subsidiary's revolving credit facility. With the buyouts of the 2018 convertible equity portfolio financing and 50% of the STX Midstream convertible equity portfolio financing complete, we estimate that the convertible equity portfolio financing structure has resulted in approximately 55% and 64% respectively or 16 million fewer units being issued, compared to raising capital with underwritten block equity, all for the benefit of unitholders.",
			"For the balance of the year, files are now expected to be limited to the remaining 50% of the STX Midstream convertible equity portfolio financing and 15% of the net renewables to convertible equity portfolio financing with the equity portion of these buyouts requiring common units of approximately $280 million and $130 million respectively. Over the next eight months, we have flexibility and time to opportunistically manage these buyouts in the most efficient way. For each buyout, we have the flexibility to deliver common units to the convertible equity portfolio financing investor, utilize the ATM program or some combination of the two. Ultimately, we will select the most efficient option. In any event, the potential unit issuance from these buyouts are not expected to exceed an average of three days of total trading volume per quarter, which we expect will make them quite manageable.",
			"Most importantly, NextEra Energy Partners' growth expectations through 2026 already factor in its financing plan, including convertible equity portfolio financing buyouts at current trading yields. Turning to distribution growth. Yesterday the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.8425 per common unit or $3.37 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this quarter, NextEra Energy Partners has grown its LP distribution per unit up nearly 350% since the IPO. Today we are pleased to announce that NextEra Energy Partners has entered into an agreement with Energy Resources to acquire an approximately 690-megawatt portfolio of long-term contracted operating wind and solar projects and attractive cash available for distribution yield.",
			"The high-quality portfolio has a cash available for distribution, weighted average remaining contract life of approximately 16 years, an average customer credit rating of BBB at S&amp;P and Baa2 at Moody's Investors Service. NextEra Energy Partners is expected to acquire the portfolio for approximately $708 million, subject to closing adjustments and is inclusive of the portfolio's existing project debt and interest rate swaps which are estimated to be approximately $142 million. In addition to the approximately $708 million purchase price, NextEra Energy Partners is also expected to assume the portfolio's existing tax equity financing balance. The remaining purchase price is expected to be funded by a combination of new project finance debt and the corporate revolving credit facility.",
			"The portfolio of assets is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA of approximately $110 million to $130 million and cash available for distribution prior to the existing project debt service of approximately $62 million to $72 million, each on a five-year average annual run rate basis, beginning December 31 2023. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of this year. Additional details on the portfolio of assets to be acquired by NextEnergy Partners can be found in the appendix of today's presentation. Next Energy Partners will remain opportunistic pursuing acquisitions in 2023. And with the closing of the transaction announced today, NextEnergy Partners expects to be well positioned to meet its year-end 2023 adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution run rate expectations.",
			"Turning to the detailed results. NextEra Energy Partners delivered first quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution results in line with management's expectations. Adjusted EBITDA of $447 million increased by $35 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by favorable contributions from the approximately 1,200 net megawatts of new projects acquired in 2022. Both adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distributions were negatively affected by lower resource from existing projects. Additionally, cash available from distribution was lower versus the prior year comparable period due to incremental debt service and timing of payable payments. Looking forward in the second half of 2023, we expect strong double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution to support NextEra Energy Partners, distribution per unit growth expectation range of 12% to 15% for the full year 2023.",
			"Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect run rate contributions for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distributions from its forecasted portfolio at December 31, 2023, to be in the ranges of $2.22 billion to $2.42 billion and $770 million to $860 million respectively. As a reminder, year-end 2023 run rate projections reflect calendar year 2024 contribution from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2023 and include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. As always, our expectations are subject to our usual caveats including normal weather and operating conditions. From a base of our fourth quarter 2022 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $3.25, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026.",
			"We continue to remain comfortable with these growth expectations. And in fact even at the current trade yield, Energy Resources portfolio alone is just one way NextEra Energy Partners believes it can meet its growth expectations through 2026. For 2023, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2023 distribution that is payable in February 2024 to be in a range of $3.64 to $3.74 per common unit. We also continue to expect to achieve our 2023 distribution growth of 12% to 15%. In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are well-positioned to continue delivering on their long-term growth prospects. At FPL that means executing on smart capital investments to deliver on its customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service.",
			"At Energy Resources that means leading the decarbonization of both the power sector and non-power sector and leveraging its competitive advantages to capitalize on low-cost renewals and new emerging technologies like green hydrogen. In NextEra Eneregy Partners, we expect to capitalize on its unmatched growth visibility to further expand its best-in-class clean energy portfolio to provide long-term distribution growth for unit holders. With that, we are happy to address your questions.",

			"In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 7.14%. It has a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 3.10%.",
			"Let's take a closer look at the factors that are likely to get reflected in PG&amp;E’s upcoming results.",
			"During most of the first quarter, PCG’s service territories observed cooler weather conditions. These may have increased the electricity demand for heating purposes from the company’s customers, thus favorably impacting the top line of PG&amp;E. Additionally, some parts of its service territories experienced significant precipitation levels, resulting in wet weather conditions.",
			"Moreover, favorable rate cases provide a positive outlook for PCG’s first-quarter revenue performance. However, its service territories had to undergo winter storm calamities, which may have interrupted the seamless supply of electricity for its customers, thus partially impairing the overall top line in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.",
			"The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $6.21 billion. This suggests growth of 7.1% from the year-ago quarter.",
			"In the first quarter of 2023, strong winter storms, accompanied by heavy rainfall and high winds, may have impacted PG&amp;E’s service territories, causing infrastructural damage, thus increasing the company’s operating expenses for storm restoration and repair. This is likely to have weighed on PCG’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter.",
			"This may have been somewhat offset by a positive impact of PCG’s wildfire risk reduction initiatives. Also, the company’s efforts to reduce non-fuel operating &amp; maintenance costs may have partially aided the bottom line.",
			"The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 29 cents per share. This indicates a decline of 3.3% from the prior-year reported figure.",

That's disappointing when you consider the market declined 0.8%. Looking at the longer term, the stock is down 25% over three years.

			"To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.",
			"Unhappily, Dominion Energy had to report a 66% decline in EPS over the last year. The share price fall of 30% isn't as bad as the reduction in earnings per share. So the market may not be too worried about the EPS figure, at the moment -- or it may have expected earnings to drop faster. With a P/E ratio of 53.49, it's fair to say the market sees an EPS rebound on the cards.",
			"You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).",
			"It's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward.

			"As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Dominion Energy, it has a TSR of -27% for the last 1 year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the <em>total</em> shareholder return.",
			"We regret to report that Dominion Energy shareholders are down 27% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 0.8%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 1.5%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"Thank you very much. Live from the Heartland. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter of 2023. <br/>First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. <br/>Now as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported first quarter 2023 earnings of $1.61 a share. Weather was a major factor in our lower results for the quarter. We saw one of the mildest winters in the history of the Upper Midwest. For example, it was the second warmest first quarter in Milwaukee since 1891, However, we're confident in our plan for the remainder of the year and we're reaffirming our guidance for 2023. As a reminder, we're guiding to a range of $4.58 to $4.62 a share for the full year. This assumes normal weather going forward. And as always, we remain focused on the fundamentals of our business, financial discipline, operating efficiency and customer satisfaction. <br/>Switching gears now. The work on our ESG progress plan continues at a steady pace. It's the largest 5-year investment plan in our history, totaling $28.1 billion for efficiency, sustainability and growth. The plan is based on projects that are low risk and highly executable. And as we look to the future, it's clear that the mega trend of decarbonization and the need for even greater reliability will drive investment plans that are long and strong. Scott will provide you with more detail on several specific projects in a moment. But I'm pleased to report that just since last December, the Wisconsin Commission has approved more than $1 billion of new capital investment by our companies. <br/>As we've discussed, we project that our ESG progress plan will drive compound earnings growth of 6.5% to 7% a year from 2023 through 2027. And we fully expect to fund our capital plan without any need for new equity. <br/>Now let's take a brief look at the regional economy. We have good news from the latest data in Wisconsin. In March, the unemployment rate came in at 2.5%. That's a record low for the state and well below the national average and we continue to see major developments in the area. Just a few weeks ago, in fact, Microsoft announced that it plans to create a new data center campus in our region with an initial investment of $1 billion. This data center complex will be built south of Milwaukee in the technology park that is also being developed by Foxconn. Microsoft will purchase a 315-acre parcel in Area 3 of the park. Local approvals have been received, and we expect Microsoft to close on the land purchase on or before the 31st of July. <br/>In the meantime, Microsoft is moving full speed ahead with planning and design work. The decision by Microsoft underscores the strength and the potential of the Wisconsin economy and positions us very well for more growth in the technology sector. <br/>And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more information on our regulatory developments, our operations and our infrastructure segment. Scott, all yours.",
			"<strong>Scott J. Lauber</strong>",
			"Thank you, Gale. I'd like to start with a few updates on the regulatory front. <br/>New rates have been in effect for our Wisconsin utilities since the start of the year. As expected, we're planning to file a limited reopener for 2024 later this quarter. The filing will address the recovery of capital investments for projects going into service this year and in 2024. The return on equity and the equity layer are all set and are not up for consideration, the request will be quite modest, and we expect a decision from the commission by the end of this year. <br/>And as you recall, we have rate filings under review in Illinois for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. The next step will be for the commission staff and interveners to file their direct testimony on May 9. Hearings are scheduled for early August. After 9 years without a rate case at Peoples Gas, who are making these requests for 2024 to support our investment in key infrastructure and with lower natural gas prices, we project customer bills will be flat with 2022. <br/>We also have rate reviews in progress at Minnesota Energy Resources and Michigan Gas Utilities. We filed in Minnesota last November and interim rates went into effect January 1. I'm pleased to announce that we received a settlement with parties that would result in a 7.1% increase in base rates. That's based on a 9.65% return on equity with an equity layer of 53%. This settlement is subject to commission approval, which we expect in the next several months. <br/>And in March, we filed for a base rate increase of 9.1% at Michigan Gas Utilities for 2024. This application is primarily driven by our capital investments supporting safety and reliability. <br/>Meanwhile, we're making good progress on a number of regulatory capital projects. Red Barn Wind Park went to service last month. The project is providing 82 megawatts of clean energy capacity to our Wisconsin customers. And as Gale noted, we received 3 significant approvals for the Wisconsin Commission since last December for the Dairyland Solar Battery Park, West Riverside Energy Center and Koshkonong Solar Battery Parks. We discussed the Dairyland approval last quarter. And as you recall, the solar park is planned to go in service in 2024. <br/>West Riverside is a combined cycle natural gas plant owned by Alliant Energy. In February, we received approval for our purchase of 100 megawatts of Riverside capacity for approximately $102 million. We expect to close this purchase by the end of the month. We have an option to purchase another 100 megawatts of Riverside capacity, and we plan to exercise that option later this year. <br/>We also received approval for our purchase of Koshkonong Solar Battery Park with plans for 300 megawatts of solar capacity and 165 megawatts of battery storage. We will own 90% of the project with an expected investment of $585 million. We project the solar portion of this facility to go into service in 2025. <br/>We also continue on the Badger Hollow II solar facility and the Paris Solar-Battery Park. While Badger Hollow has received some of the solar panels, the remaining panels for projects are currently in Chicago going through the customs process. Assuming timing release of the panels, we expect these solar parks to go into service late this year or early next year. <br/>For the Paris and Koshkonong projects, we're evaluating the timing of the battery investments. Of course, we'll keep you updated on any future developments. <br/>Outside of utilities, we continue to make progress on zero carbon projects in our WEC Infrastructure segment. In February, we completed our acquisition of the Sapphire Sky Wind Farm, now in service in Illinois. As a reminder, that project offers 250 megawatts of capacity in total, and we own a 90% share. Also in February, we added an 80% ownership in the Samson 1 Solar Project located in Northeast Texas. The project has a capacity of 250 megawatts. As disclosed previously, Samson 1 suffered storm damage at the beginning of March, but we expect no significant bottom line impact for the property losses. The project is currently producing energy at about 70% level and improving every day as we continue to restore the site. <br/>With that, I'll turn things back to Gale.",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"Scott, thank you very much. <br/>Now as you may recall, our Board of Directors at its January meeting raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.2%. This marks the 20th consecutive year that our company will reward shareholders with higher dividends. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're right in the middle of that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. <br/>Next up, Xia will provide you with more details on our financial results and our second quarter guidance. Xia?",
			"<strong>Xia Liu</strong>",
			"Thank you, Gale. Our 2023 first quarter earnings of $1.61 per share decreased $0.18 per share compared to the first quarter of 2022. Our earnings package include the comparison of first quarter results on Page 12. I'll walk through the significant drivers. <br/>Starting with our utility operations, our earnings were $0.09 lower compared to the first quarter of '22. Rate-based growth contributed $0.22 to earnings, driven by continued investment in our ESG progress plan. This includes the base rate increase for our Wisconsin utilities as well as the interim rate increase for Minnesota Energy Resources, both of which were effective January 1, 2023. This favorable margin impact from rate base growth was more than offset by a number of factors. <br/>First, as Gale noted, we experienced one of the mildest winters in history which drove a $0.12 decrease in earnings compared to the first quarter of last year. Additionally, timing of fuel expense, depreciation and amortization interest, day-to-day O&amp;M, taxes and other drove a combined $0.19 negative variance. <br/>Before I turn to earnings at the other segments, let me briefly discuss our weather-normalized sales. You can find our sales information on Page 9 of the earnings package. I'd like to remind you that weather normalization is not a perfect science, extreme warm weather in the first quarter may not be fully reflected in our weather-normalized data. Having said that, Weather-normal retail natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding natural gas used for power generation, were down 1%. However, residential usage, again on a weather-normal basis, grew 0.9%. That was ahead of our forecast. Weather-normal retail electric deliveries, excluding the iron ore mine, were 1.9% lower. Residential usage was relatively flat compared to last year. <br/>Now at our Energy Infrastructure segment, Earnings were $0.01 lower in the first quarter of '23 compared to the first quarter of '22. Production tax credits were higher by $0.03 quarter-over-quarter resulting from acquisitions of renewable generation projects. This increase was largely offset by a pickup that we recorded in the first quarter last year from the resolution of market settlement in the Southwest Power Pool. <br/>Finally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment decreased $0.08 primarily driven by an increase in interest expense and a pickup recorded in the first quarter '22 from our investment in a clean energy fund. These items were partially offset by favorable rabbi buy trust performance and some tax and other items. Remember, rabbi trust performance is largely offset in O&amp;M. <br/>Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $281 million. The mild winter and timing of recovery of commodity costs contributed to this decrease. Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $1.3 billion in the first quarter of '23, and $884 million increase from the first quarter of '22. This was primarily driven by the acquisition of the Whitewater Natural Gas Power Generation Facility in our Wisconsin segment, as well as the Sapphire Sky Wind Farm and Samson 1 Solar facility in our Infrastructure segment. <br/>In closing, as Gale mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance of $4.58 to $4.62 per share, assuming normal weather for the rest of the year. To offset the mild first quarter weather impact, we are implementing a variety of initiatives. As a result, we now expect our day-to-day O&amp;M to be 2% to 3% higher than 2022 versus our previous expectation of 3% to 5% higher. <br/>I will also add that largely due to timing of O&amp;M and fuel expense, we expect earnings in the second half of this year to be materially better than the second half of 2022. For the second quarter, we're expecting a range of $0.83 to $0.85 per share. This accounts for April weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As a reminder, we earned $0.91 per share in the second quarter last year. <br/>With that, I'll turn it back to Gale.",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"Xia, thank you. Overall, we're on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders. <br/>Operator, we're ready now for the Q&amp;A portion of the call.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"Afternoon, Shar. You're still using those pillow cases?",
			"<strong>Shahriar Pourreza</strong>",
			"Yes. But they don't match the rest of the house, so that's the issue. How are you doing?",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"We're fine. How about you?",
			"<strong>Shahriar Pourreza</strong>",
			"Good. Not too bad, not too bad. So Gale, a quick one here. So half a dozen utilities have issued these like hybrid convertible notes at pretty attractive rates. I think in some cases, it's like 200 basis points of interest rate savings. There's obviously no equity credit there. So you've seen it even being utilized by some peers that don't need equity. I just want to get your sense from your shot like whether you see, I guess, any value with these hybrid securities to help fund the 5-year plan? Does it make sense? I mean obviously, we're waiting for your Q to be released to see if there's any kind of language around it, but.",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"Yes, good question, Shar. And clearly, there are a number of companies in the sector even 2 today that have announced the use of this cash pay convert product. We've taken a good hard look at it. And let me just say this, if we found -- as we go through the course of the remainder of 2023, if we found that it was really advantageous for us, we would certainly take a hard look. But we're -- we're more than halfway, Shar through our debt issuance plan for 2023 and doing very well against our budget. <br/>Xia?",
			"<strong>Xia Liu</strong>",
			"Yes, not much to add. We're very aware of the transaction. We understand the pros and cons. And at this time, we really have not made any decision as to whether cash pay convertible notes fit those -- fit our criteria. But we've done quite a bit financing so far, and we've done really well, better than the planned rates. So.",
			"<strong>Shahriar Pourreza</strong>",
			"And then just in short, I know I don't want to front run the queue, but is there -- will there be any language around looking at hybrids potentially as an option to fund the plan or not?",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"Shar, are you talking about hybrids? Are you talking about the cash pay converts or both?",
			"<strong>Shahriar Pourreza</strong>",
			"These cash pay converts or hybrids or whatever you want to call them at this point.",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"I don't think there's any language that we're planning in the Q or...",
			"<strong>Xia Liu</strong>",
			"No. We haven't planned that at this point.",
			"<strong>Shahriar Pourreza</strong>",
			"Okay. Perfect. I appreciate that. And then just lastly on Illinois, obviously, the cases were filed in January. There's not a lot of data points since then, but gas prices have actually have come off, which I think hopefully will help the case. It's a tailwind. Any thoughts, I guess, Gale at this point on potentially settling, how has the dialogue been going? Do you see anything we should be thinking about?",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"Way, way too early to even think about or contemplate settlement in the process in Illinois. The process is going along very smoothly. I think the next steps as Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks, the next step will be staff and intervenor testimony on May 9. But so far, we are responding to data requests. The process in Illinois is going exactly as historically they've gone. <br/>And to your point about commodity costs moving in our favor, and they moved even more in our favor since we filed the case. But long story short, even with the base increase that we're seeking, you combine that with much lower commodity costs, and we expect customer bills to be flat even granting a full base rate increase for 2020 -- for bills in 2024. So again, we think that's very good news. <br/>And when you look at just the basic facts of what we're -- of what we filed. This will be, as you may recall, the first base rate increase for Peoples Gas since we acquired the company, first base rate increase actually in 9 years. And our O&amp;M is about $60 million a year lower than when we actually acquired the company in 2015. So a pretty good story.",
			"<strong>Shahriar Pourreza</strong>",
			"Perfect. Congrats on great execution so far. I appreciate it.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.",
			"<strong>Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith</strong>",
			"Listen, let me follow up on where Shar would go with that. So with respect to the Peoples case here and just talking a little bit about the future of gas, but also just the CapEx and just some of the scrutiny on bill pressures. How do you think about moderating bills? I mean, obviously, gas has rolled over any mitigating items, circumstances we should be thinking about on that front? And definitely, how do you think and respond to some of the -- there's been some (inaudible) out there, et cetera. Any thoughts as to how you tackle sort of the longer term versus the here and now of investing without the QIP in place in the traditional sense?",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"Yes. Good question, Julien. On the QIP program and the investment in the safety modernization program, the pipe upgrade program that we've been carrying out in Chicago. Let me first say that we really welcome the public debate and the policy decision that the Illinois Commerce Commission will make about the future of the program. And just to put it in perspective, on average, we've invested about $280 million a year in upgrading the pipe network under the city of Chicago, which is, by the way, one of the oldest and now most deteriorated natural gas delivery networks in the country. So long story short, we're almost 36% complete with the pipe upgrade plan and again, investing about $280 million a year. <br/>Now, those who think we should do something different are banking on electrification. So the bets you would have to make to not, in some form, continue the program is that Chicago can completely electrify in less than 15 years because the independent study that the Illinois Commerce Commission has ordered and accepted, the independent engineering study shows that more than 80% of the iron pipes and our delivery network under Chicago have a useful life left of 15 years. And then lastly -- or 15 years or less. <br/>And then lastly, there are some who say, well, just patch the pipes. Julien, I'm telling you some of those pipes can't be patched. And when you look at the continued O&amp;M that would be required to patch after patch after patch, it would not, in our estimation, save customers any money. So we think there's overwhelming evidence here to continue the program, we would do so under our proposal as an annual base rate increase, if you will, to cover the cost of what we think is a very important program for both the immediate safety of Chicago. And then secondly, to preserve a long-term future, where that delivery network could deliver, say, hydrogen or other no carbon fuels to keep Chicago warm. So I hope that response helps.",
			"<strong>Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith</strong>",
			"Absolutely does. I appreciate it. With respect to the process, I want to come back to this super quickly. We've got a new ICC in place, et cetera. I mean to the extent to which that you're looking for direction here, I mean, this rate case should be the right venue to think about the pace and the sort of the new vision on where things are going, right? There's not some other avenue? I'm just trying to think through the -- how the ICC wants to articulate a response to your proposed spending, if you will? It will be through the case.",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"There are extensive, as you would expect, and we wanted to have this kind of dialogue. We welcome this kind of dialogue, but there are multiple data requests as there are in any rate review but particularly, there are data requests about the program, about the need for the program, about the future of the program, et cetera. So I agree with you, I think this is the proper forum to have that policy decision made and everything is proceeding under the normal schedule, if you will, of data requests. And now, as we said earlier, the next formal step would be May 9 when we expect staff and intervenor testimony.",
			"<strong>Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith</strong>",
			"Right. Yes. Thank you for confirming that. And we'll look next week. All right. You take care.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan Chase.",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"Jeremy, are you moving to -- Jeremy, are you removing the Republic Bank or?",
			"<strong>Jeremy Bryan Tonet</strong>",
			"Nothing to say there. Just wanted to kind of come back, I guess, to the weather impacts as happened in the quarter and the offset there. Should we think about this as just kind of O&amp;M being the main tool for offsets over the balance of the year? I'm just wondering if you could quantify or give any more color there and how that might shape up across the year, I think you said in the back half, it kind of lightens up a bit. So any more color there could be helpful.",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"Yes, I'd be happy to do that, and we'll ask Xia to give you some specifics. Let me frame a couple of things for you. <br/>First of all, we've got a pretty experienced management team. We've been down this road before. So we have a pretty well-tested playbook and the playbook has been implemented. There are O&amp;M initiatives in every group of the company, every department, every section. They have plans and they have goals. So a big part of it, obviously, is related to day-to-day operation and maintenance costs. <br/>Another big positive for us, again, compared to our budget and our forecast is really the interest cost savings that we're seeing. And then we're going to ask Xia and Scott to kind of briefly walk you through the difference that we see in Q3 and Q4 this year compared to Q3 and Q4 of last year when we were deep into our sharing bands with customers. So Xia, why don't we start off with you and some specifics and then we'll let -- I'll ask Scott to talk about the sharing bands that really impacted Q3 and Q4 last year.",
			"<strong>Xia Liu</strong>",
			"Sure. So Q1 weather was about $0.12 deficit, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. So we've identified O&amp;M reduction targets that can offset $0.04, $0.05, $0.06 of that. We also built some conservative financing assumptions in the plan. So in terms of issuing debt at rates lower than the plan or continued execution later this year, we expect the financing savings to be $0.05 to $0.06 also. So between those 2 items, we could offset the Q1 weather deficit. But we also have other initiatives we're looking at beyond those 2 items.",
			"<strong>Scott J. Lauber</strong>",
			"Sure. And then when you think about the last half of the year, you have to remember the last several years, we've been very fortunate to actually be into a sharing band where we're sharing with customers. I think last year, we were able to reduce our fuel request about $54 million. So that's quite a bit when you think about charges in the last half of the year. And last half, remember, we had warmer than normal weather, so we were able to accelerate or do some additional spending for our customers. So we incurred additional O&amp;M costs plus the sharing band. So that was meaningful for the last half of the year compared to what you see this year come and shaping up.",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"And to Scott's point, we obviously don't see ourselves into the sharing bands with customers this year. So I think in terms of basically $54 million of costs that won't reappear in the third and fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the second half of 2022.",
			"<strong>Jeremy Bryan Tonet</strong>",
			"Got it. That's very helpful there. And just shifting a bit to solar and I know that you touched on this a bit in the prepared remarks as it relates to the solar supply chain. But just wondering, I guess, thoughts on ongoing progressional efforts to revoke the present 2-year solar tariff suspension. Just wondering if you had any thoughts you could share there or just on the supply chain in general.",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"Well, my understanding is that President Biden said he would veto any effort to undo that particular initiative. So I'm not sure that one's going anywhere. But in the meantime, as Scott indicated in his prepared remarks, for our Badger Hollow II Solar Project in Wisconsin for our regulated utility and for our Paris Solar-Battery Project, again, for our Wisconsin utilities. Scott, we got all the solar panels we need hanging in a warehouse in Chicago.",
			"<strong>Scott J. Lauber</strong>",
			"They're in the warehouse in Chicago. We're just working with customs, to get them out of that warehouse. And of course, for the future projects, we're looking at other alternatives, including U.S. potential options available in the future to source those future projects that the commission has approved.",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"Jeremy, Scott and I went down to that warehouse one night, but the Doberman wouldn't let us in. So -- but we know all of those panels are there.",
			"<strong>Jeremy Bryan Tonet</strong>",
			"Got it. That's helpful. And then just one last quick one, if I could, as it relates to transmission and future MISO tranches maybe kind of taking shape in the not-too-distant future here. Just wondering if you had any updated thoughts permitting reform or with the MISO outlook could mean for wet down the road?",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"Don't see much of any progress on permitting reform at this stage of the game. But again, as MISO works its way through all of the stakeholder process, Tranche 2 Phase I, the early indications are quite favorable in terms of the investment opportunity being even greater than what we saw in basically Tranche 1. And then in addition to that, I mentioned the major economic development project that was just announced with Microsoft, any particular upside on transmission or generation needs related to that Microsoft project would be incremental to the plan and not in the current plan. And I'm guessing there may be some additional transmission need coming out of that project, Scott?",
			"<strong>Scott J. Lauber</strong>",
			"No, that's correct, Gale. And also a reminder, Tranche 1 was using a lot of existing right of away. So we're very happy using existing right if aways to be able to get that construction started in an earlier time frame in that '25, '26 time frame.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research.",
			"<strong>Michael P. Sullivan</strong>",
			"Maybe just back to the O&amp;M. So understand it was going to tick up a little bit this year. Now you're kind of pulling that back to help offset the weather. As we think beyond 2023, how should we think about the trajectory? I know you have a track record of bringing it down, and this year was kind of the first time in a while. It was set to step up.",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"Yes. I think when you look at the near-term future past 2023, we're going to be seeing another chunk of O&amp;M reduction related to the planned retirements. And just as a reminder, we have 4 older units at our Oak Creek site, units 5, 6, 7 and 8. And units 5 and 6 are scheduled for retirement next year and then units 7 and 8 in 2025. And along with that, the retirement will come a substantial chunk of O&amp;M reduction. Scott?",
			"<strong>Scott J. Lauber</strong>",
			"No, you're exactly right. As we put on those retirements, O&amp;M will go down. But remember, the driver for the O&amp;M increases this year as we put in new plants into the system. We added a lot of capital over this last year and to run those new plants, including the new race units that we're putting in service and also the plants in Milwaukee infrastructure, all of that's additional O&amp;M. So really supporting capital investments.",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"And one other thought adding on to what Scott is saying, there's another benefit to the investments that we're making that are coming online, particularly the solar investments that we're in the final stages of completion. Those investments when they're online and producing energy actually replace fuel costs. So in addition to O&amp;M, chunks of savings coming forward here from the retirement of older coal-fired units, we're also going to see reductions in fuel costs simply because, obviously, with solar and wind, the fuel is free.",
			"<strong>Michael P. Sullivan</strong>",
			"Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate the detail. Just related to that, to the extent that we see any shifting in timing of the solar with supply chain issues and the panels in the warehouse and all that. Does -- how do you kind of react to that? Is there a risk that -- is that -- are you tying that to the coal shutdown retirements in terms of just earning on those assets and rate base? Are there other things you have to move around? Just what are kind of the other implications across the business to the extent that your solar projects get pushed down a little bit?",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"Well, to answer the second part of your question on retirements of the 4 older coal-fired units, we don't see any change in that schedule. That, I believe, will continue to be the 2024 and 2025 retirement dates for each of those 2 units. <br/>And then in terms of potential further delays again, we have to get clearance here and we've got a plan B if we can't get clearance to finish the solar projects. But remember, these are regulated projects. The commission is very, very supportive of the need for those projects. <br/>And Scott, we're earning AFUDC during the construction period.",
			"<strong>Scott J. Lauber</strong>",
			"Correct. And we're continuing the construction. So they are site ready when the solar panels get released. So Paris and Badger Hollow II construction is pretty well done. On Badger Hollow II, we just need the solar panels and Paris is moving along nicely. So those panels already. Won't take long to pop them on.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"Wow, you got the Jersey #8 on. Durgesh?",
			"<strong>Durgesh Chopra</strong>",
			"I don't know. I don't know about that, Gale.",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"I know. I know. Still die hard Eagle fan, right?",
			"<strong>Durgesh Chopra</strong>",
			"It's still hurts, still hurts.",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"I'm sorry.",
			"<strong>Durgesh Chopra</strong>",
			"Okay, yes, we'll be back next year. <br/>So just Gale, I wanted to go back to the reopener. We've had a ton of discussion here as you make the filing. I think Scott mentioned in his opening remarks that it's not for ROE for equity layer. Maybe can you just talk about the projects that you will be filing for? Am I right in thinking about that these projects are already approved so you're not necessarily seeking for prudency of those projects? And then to the extent that you can sort of help us frame what CapEx would -- are we looking at as you file -- as you make these filings in the quarter?",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"Sure. We'll ask Scott to help out as well. <br/>So you are correct. This limited reopener as defined in the rate order, does not -- I mean, the ROE and the equity layer are set and they're not up for reconsideration. There's roughly and yes, you are correct, all of the projects that we will be filing for recovery in this limited reopener have already been approved by the commission. So that is absolutely correct. <br/>And Scott, it's about $1 billion of capital that will be coming in, if I recall correctly, into that reopener.",
			"<strong>Scott J. Lauber</strong>",
			"Yes, it's approximately that. I don't have the exact number at my fingertips, but when you think about the reopener, it's projects like we talked about, Riverside was approved now that $102 million, we'll put that into the reopener. The Weston Race Units those are going to be in for a full year. So that will be part of the reopener. So some of these are full year, some of these are actually part of a year capital projects.",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"And LNG? One of our LNG's projects.",
			"<strong>Scott J. Lauber</strong>",
			"The LNG projects. So it's really across electric and gas and just truing up with the capital additions.",
			"<strong>Durgesh Chopra</strong>",
			"Got it. And then you've previously talked about O&amp;M savings to be included as part of that request. Is that also part of this limited reopener filing or could be a part of this limited reopener filing?",
			"<strong>Scott J. Lauber</strong>",
			"Sure that the real -- the O&amp;M piece is really the retirement for the Oak Creek 5 and 6, those older Oak Creek units. Remember, last year, we filed the case and then we extended them and now what we're doing is closing those units at the end of May here of 2024. So that will be the O&amp;M reduction that we put in the actual order for us to factor that into the case.",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"And Durgesh, the largest O&amp;M reduction. Scott's exactly right. The largest O&amp;M reduction from the closure of the Oak Creek units really will come all 4 units are retired because we won't be retiring the environmental control operation at that site for those older units until all 4 are off-line.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank.",
			"<strong>Andrew Marc Weisel</strong>",
			"First, a question on timing of fuel cost. I know a minus $0.07 in the 1Q waterfall. What's your expectation for the full year based on current curves? Do you expect that to fully reverse and if so, when?",
			"<strong>Xia Liu</strong>",
			"Andrew, this is Xia. We -- that's purely timing. We expect that to recover in the second quarter and throughout the third and fourth quarter. Remember that last year, like Gale mentioned, we booked quite a bit of fuel expense because of the sharing band, and we don't expect that to happen. So we see a pickup in fuel in terms of impact on earnings.",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"So purely timing. We'll see a second half turnaround.",
			"<strong>Andrew Marc Weisel</strong>",
			"Okay. And then on usage, Xia, if you could elaborate a little bit on the demand trend. I think you said residential gas came in better than expected, adjusting for weather, but on the electric side all customer classes were down. How much of that has just been noise around the extreme weather? Or do you see any notable changes in demand trends?",
			"<strong>Xia Liu</strong>",
			"Yes, a lot of expected noise around weather normalization, like I said, just to put it in perspective, the weather-normalized residential sales met our forecasted expectations. So those are the higher-margin segment. <br/>And on the C&amp;I front, we -- just a reminder, we have a very diverse mix of industries. We call provide essential services like food, paper, plastic processing and many of which had a really good growth in the first quarter and we don't have exposure to lots of automobile or oil and gas industry. So we feel really good about the industry mix and we really haven't seen any trends of any potential recession in our service territory. So we track about a little over 100 large customers regularly. There are 4 that contributed to almost half of the negative variance in the first quarter year-over-year, and 2 of those were down substantially year-over-year because of noneconomic reasons. <br/>So one had a fire, the other had an outbreak. So we expect those to return to normal through the rest of the year. So -- and again, whether normal noise played a role in these numbers. So I wouldn't overreact to these numbers right now.",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"Yes. Andrew, just to build on to what Xia's saying, when you look at the temperatures across Q1, they were basically 2 standard deviations away from normal. And I can just tell you, not only for our company but for the industry as a whole, and for those of you who followed us a long time, you've heard me say this a gazillion times. I mean the weather normalization techniques are far more precise than accurate. And the further you get away from in terms of standard deviations from the norm, the less reliable the weather normalization techniques are. So again, just as a general caveat, as Xia said, I wouldn't read too much in the Q1 numbers.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho.",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"You got a dog to name?",
			"<strong>Anthony Christopher Crowdell</strong>",
			"I was thinking that warehouse Doberman, that may work for Julien.",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"And not a bad idea. I'll take all of your input on naming the dog for Julien, but go Anthony.",
			"<strong>Anthony Christopher Crowdell</strong>",
			"Andrew, Xia had just took my question on the recession in C&amp;I sales. If I could just pivot and I think maybe some of your comments earlier on the iron piping in Chicago. I'm just curious, if we think back maybe 10 years ago or 15 years ago, when we talked about nuclear generation, how we're getting rid of it? How we're getting rid of it? And then all of a sudden, we've come to the realization of its importance and zero carbon. Do you think we have a similar moment in gas LDCs? And if we do, do you think that's going to be more dependent on its locations such as you bring up colder Midwest area that, hey, there is this recognition that if we wanted to retire it, we have to do it, electrified within 15 years were that as we get closer to that the parties realize how valuable the asset is?",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"Yes. That's a great question, Anthony. And I do think there will be an epiphany moment. Don't know exactly when that epiphany moment will occur, but here are a couple of thoughts. The first is if you think you can electrify completely by, let's say, 15 years from now, you then have to take the next step and say, how are we going to build the generation that would be needed to replace gas heating. And what kind of generation would that be?<br/>Well, think about when gas heating is needed the most. It's the heavy cold winter days in January and February, right? So how much solar could you count on particularly in the Midwest in January and February? How much wind could you count on in January and February? And guess what? You end up clicking into the plan a tremendous amount of gas-fired power generation. When people start working through that equation, I think there will be quite an epiphany moment. I think that's part of it. <br/>And then the other is, as we continue to see the evolution of hydrogen hubs and as we continue to see more and more cost effectiveness from hydrogen under the IRA. I mean some gas utilities are already beginning to blend hydrogen with natural gas, we're beginning to blend. In fact, this summer, we will begin blending RNG, renewable natural gas into our network. <br/>So I think as people begin to think through past the bumper sticker, yes, you're going to see an epiphany moment about how valuable having that resource will be as we transition to a low and no carbon future. I mean, think about it another way. We have got to get this transition right to no-carbon future. And if we sacrifice reliability in that transition, it will delay the transition for many, many, many years. So we're back to all of the above and we're back to -- I think we will have a moment where everybody recognizes the practical approach to this and the safe approach to this.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our final question will come from the line of [Ashar Khan] with [Parisian].",
			"<strong>Unidentified Analyst</strong>",
			"Most of my questions have been answered. I just had a small one. So, why are we down quarter-over-quarter in the second quarter? Could you just help me with the variances which you expect in the second quarter?",
			"<strong>Xia Liu</strong>",
			"Sure. Be happy to. So financing costs are expected to be higher compared to the Q2 last year. So that's a big driver. There is plus and minuses, but we do have rate base growth that's better than last year, fuel is expected to be better last year, but largely offset by financing costs.",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"Terrific. Well, folks, I think that concludes -- is there more? I'm sorry.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"I'll now turn the call back over to you, Mr. Klappa for any concluding remarks.",
			"<strong>Gale E. Klappa</strong>",
			"There we go. I jump the gun. Thank you. Well, that concludes our conference call for today. Thanks so much for participating, as always. If you have additional questions, feel free to contact Beth Straka at (414) 221-4639. Thank you, everybody. Take care.",

Additionally, the company filed its Integrated Resource Plan (IRP).",

Thanks to bipartisan legislation and broad support from consumer advocates, we are delivering on that promise. This will provide immediate relief for our customers now and ongoing savings in the future.\"",
			"The rate decrease was enabled by bipartisan legislation passed in the 2023 Virginia General Assembly, which requires the company to eliminate <span class=\"xn-money\">$350 million</span> in stand-alone charges, known as riders. This would reduce the monthly bill for a typical residential customer by nearly <span class=\"xn-money\">$7</span>.",
			"In addition, a separate proposal with the intent to securitize certain fuel costs will provide up to <span class=\"xn-money\">$7</span> a month in additional savings beginning <span class=\"xn-chron\">July 1</span>. If approved by the SCC, fuel securitization would reduce the stand-alone fuel charge on customers' monthly bills by allowing the company to spread fuel costs over a multi-year period.",
			"The monthly savings from both proposals will be partially offset by a <span class=\"xn-money\">$2.67</span> increase to the stand-alone transmission charge that, if approved, will go into effect on <span class=\"xn-chron\">September 1</span>, resulting in net monthly savings of <span class=\"xn-money\">$4</span> - <span class=\"xn-money\">$11</span> for a typical residential customer.",

			"The latest forecast from the regional grid operator PJM indicates electricity demand in Dominion Energy Virginia's service area will grow significantly more over the next 15 years than it did over the last 15 years.",
			"To reliably meet this unprecedented growth, the company will continue developing its industry-leading renewable portfolio as required by the Virginia Clean Economy Act, while preserving most of its current power stations until at least the late 2030s.",
			"\"This 'all of the above' approach ensures we can reliably serve our customers 'around-the-clock,' especially on the hottest and coldest days of the year,\" said Baine. \"Our plan balances the benefits of renewables with the reliability of 'on-demand' power so we can meet the growing needs of our customers.\" ",

The company continues to make needed investments to replace aging infrastructure, comply with water quality and environmental regulations and meet customers’ water and wastewater service needs. If approved, new rates reflecting these investments would not go into effect until February 2024.",
			"\"This rate request provides for recovery of our investment from 2020 to present and seeks to facilitate future system investments into 2025,\" said Robert Burton, president of West Virginia American Water. \"The rates established in our last request did not recognize more than $48 million in system investments we had made by the time those rates took effect. Today’s filing seeks to remedy this investment recovery delay and to create long-term rate stability for our customers by accounting for the investment occurring throughout our water and wastewater systems.\"",
			"Recognizing the needs of our most vulnerable customers, the company is proposing a new Low-Income Tariff as part of this filing. This expanded, four-tiered proposal will better tailor rates to different levels of household income. Under this expanded tariff, eligible households would receive monthly bill discounts of between 15 and 65 percent for water and wastewater service. In addition to the proposed tariff, the current Department of Health and Human Resources 20 percent discount program and other customer assistance programs would continue.",
			"\"As a company, we believe that the service we provide must be safe, complying with all Environmental Protection Agency regulations and Safe Drinking Water Act standards; reliable, demonstrating resiliency in the face of adverse conditions; and affordable,\" continued Burton. \"With this in mind, we are pleased to expand our low-income options with our proposed tariff that will reduce rates for qualifying customers.\"",
			"If West Virginia American Water’s proposed rates are approved as requested in today’s filing, the monthly water bill for the average residential customer using 3,000 gallons per month would increase approximately $15 per month after factoring in the current Distribution System Improvement Charge (DSIC) currently appearing on customer bills. The average residential wastewater bill of 3,000 gallons would increase approximately $19 per month. New rates will not take effect until February 2024, following a 300-day statutory review by the PSC.",

Unit 4 is projected to enter service in late fourth quarter 2023 or the first quarter 2024.",

That has allowed us to safely complete hot functional testing on Unit 4 in significantly less time than we did for Unit 3. It's incredible that these new units will provide our state with zero-emissions energy for the next 60 to 80 years, and that's thanks to the dedication of the teams at the site to getting these units built, and built right.\"",
			"During hot functional testing, plant systems achieved normal operating pressure and temperature, without nuclear fuel in the reactor, to demonstrate the systems will operate on an integrated basis as designed. Now, the site team focuses on completing the remaining work necessary to submit documentation to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) that all inspection, tests and analyses have been performed and all acceptance criteria, collectively known as ITAACS, have been met on Vogtle Unit 4 as required by Southern Nuclear's Combined Operating License. Each ITAAC closure notice must be verified by the NRC before fuel can be loaded into the reactor.",
			"The new Vogtle units are an essential part of Georgia Power's commitment to delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to its 2.7 million customers. Once operating, the two new units, which will be clean energy sources that produce zero emissions, are expected to power more than 500,000 homes and businesses. Southern Nuclear will operate the new units on behalf of the co-owners: Georgia Power, Oglethorpe Power, MEAG Power and Dalton Utilities.",

			"So far, a handful of the S&amp;P 500 members from the Zacks Utilities sector have released their Q1 earnings. Another cohort of major utility stocks, including <strong>Edison International</strong> EIX and <strong>Public Service Enterprise Group</strong> PEG, is set to announce earnings on May 2.",
			"Domestic-focused utility companies are focused on cost management and implementation of energy-efficiency programs. Favorable rate revision and customer additions have been creating fresh demand as well as assisting the utilities. Investment in strengthening the infrastructure has been allowing utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings. Domestic-focused operations also insulate utilities from the adverse impact of currency fluctuation. These factors are projected to contribute to this sector’s Q1 results.",
			"A clear transition is evident in the Utilities space, with the players gradually moving toward clean sources of fuel to produce electricity and lower emission. The stringent regulations pertaining to emissions and the high cost of conventional fuel and government incentives on the usage of clean fuel have been leading utilities to focus more on clean energy sources. Many utilities have already pledged to provide 100% electricity from clean sources in the next few decades. We expect the Q1 results from utility companies to reflect such clean energy developments.",
			"The passage of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is expected to have supported and accelerated utilities’ transition toward clean energy sources. IRA has removed the uncertainties relating to federal incentives provided for renewable sources usage. The Act entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions in a much more predictable way for a long time and will create earnings visibility.",
			"However, the fact that utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations, have made their operations difficult in the current interest rate scenario. Thus, the capital-intensive utilities are likely to have experienced higher borrowing costs thanks to the increase in interest rates from near-zero levels, which in turn might have hurt their bottom line performance. Also, warmer-than-normal weather conditions in major parts of the United States might have had unfavorably impacted the utilities’ top-line performance in the January-March quarter.",

			"\"When most of the fire people left that first day of the Route Fire, they probably thought, ‘tomorrow is going be a big day,'\" said Scott Jones, a 32-year retired veteran of the <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Los Angeles County Fire Department;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://pr.report/KJQnwz0U\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Los Angeles County Fire Department</a> who is now the QRF program lead coordinator. \"They had a lot of resources ordered for the following day, but <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:the QRF came in there and knocked down the flaming front with fire retardant on the first night;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://pr.report/pMoRq6ZL\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the QRF came in there and knocked down the flaming front with fire retardant on the first night</a>.\"",
			"The fleet also includes an S-76 intelligence and reconnaissance helicopter, which does not drop payload but is equally important. Crew members wear night vision goggles and operate as the quarterbacks of the QRF team.",
			"\"If you listen to the S-76 crew organize aircraft, talk to the ground, the multitasking and the abilities that they have, it's mind-blowing,\" said Ryan O'Herron, another CH-47 lead pilot. \"Their sense of calm in a high-intensity environment like the Route Fire. With dozens of other agency aircraft, maintaining effective communication is quite a task that requires a special personality.\"",
			"Fred Burris, an air tactical supervisor, is one of those special personalities. He has been flying the S-76 helicopter since 2009.",
			"\"We make sure the airspace is organized in what we call the fire traffic area,\" Burris said. \"We organize that to ensure the aircraft are oriented to one another, to their drop and the target area, and then simultaneously or in sequence, we're talking to the ground incident commander.\"",
			"His years of experience in the S-76 combined with 40 years fighting fires - much of it as a wildland firefighter - are instrumental for the nocturnal orchestration of air drops.",
			"\"We're looking down at the ground and seeing a hand crew, and I see what they're trying to do, even in the absence of a lot of direction,\" Burris said. \"It's an attribute we bring as the aerial supervision for the QRF.\"",
			"This experience provides the helitanker pilots with confidence in the firefighting airspace.",
			"\"Fred and his team provide the pilots with the comfort and security that they know where they're going and that someone is looking out for them,\" Jones said. \"The S-76 team warns the pilots of a multitude of hazards, so it's an important aspect of the teamwork.\"",
			"The four aircraft, with Burris' team in the lead, will patrol the Southern California skies again this year.",

			"While the threat of wildfires in Southern California may have eased temporarily because of an unusually wet winter, there's little doubt the threat will return as the weather warms.",
			"\"I have worked across the country and overseas for many years, and one thing I've noticed about Southern California is the sheer volume of land adjacent to millions of people,\" said O'Herron. \"You don't see this to the same degree in Santiago, Chile, or Sydney, Australia.

The program is a partnership between the Arbor Day Foundation and the National Association of State Foresters, which promotes delivering safe and reliable electricity while maintaining healthy community forests.",
			"\"Trees and vegetation are part of our region's natural environment and also one of the leading causes of power outages for utilities,\" said Charles Long, interim senior vice president of power delivery. \"Entergy has a robust vegetation management program that protects the power lines and ensures reliable electric service for our customers' homes and businesses. At the same time, we're helping sustain both our urban and rural landscapes, which improves quality of life for our customers and communities.\"",
			"Entergy achieved the Tree Line USA recognition by meeting five program standards: quality tree care, annual worker training, tree planting and public education, a tree-based energy conservation program, and a sponsorship of or participation in annual Arbor Day events.",
			"\"Trees are essential to creating more urban green spaces in communities across the United States,\" said Dan Lambe, chief executive of the Arbor Day Foundation. \"In addition, they provide important benefits to residents, including clean air, clean water, and vital tree shade. Service providers like Entergy demonstrate how easily trees and utilities can co-exist for the benefit of communities and residents.\"",
			"By joining the Tree Line USA program, energy service providers benefit from lowering line clearance costs due to proper pruning. As a result of those properly pruned and maintained trees, customers and communities benefit from increased reliability of service because those trees will have healthy root systems that decay less, have less structural weakness, and ultimately result in fewer downed lines during storms.",

			"This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.26%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this electricity and natural gas provider would post earnings of $0.75 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.80, delivering a surprise of 6.67%.",
			"Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.",
			"WEC Energy , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, posted revenues of $2.89 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.97%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.91 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.",
			"The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.",

Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.",
			"Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for WEC Energy: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.",

In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Utility - Electric Power is currently in the top 43% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

Also, its return on equity (ROE) pings at 10.64%, above 63.11% of sector players. Again, it’s not the most exciting opportunity among water utility stocks. However, YORW probably won’t leave you stranded.",

Unlike other water industry stocks, it features a decent balance sheet.

Also, its net margin of 1.47% is unremarkable, ranking worse than 69.44% of its peers. Nevertheless, analysts peg PRMW as a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:consensus moderate buy;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/prmw/forecast\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">consensus moderate buy</a>.

Nevertheless, the nuclear energy specialist is worth considering because it could change the game for how we view water scarcity.",
			"Long story short, NuScale specializes in small modular reactors (SMRs). Featuring a smaller physical footprint than their traditional counterparts, SMRs can be integrated into previously inaccessible areas. As well, advanced safety protocols should help ease concerns about meltdowns.

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Duke Energy Corporation (<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:NYSE:DUK;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nyse-duk/duke-energy?blueprint=2485903&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=intro&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NYSE:DUK</a>).",
			"Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.",
			"<span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Check out our latest analysis for Duke Energy;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nyse-duk/duke-energy?blueprint=2485903&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Duke Energy </a></span>",
			"The <strong>formula for return on equity</strong> is:",
			"Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity",
			"So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Duke Energy is:",
			"7.3% = US$3.8b ÷ US$52b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).",
			"The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.07 in profit.",
			"By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. You can see in the graphic below that Duke Energy has an ROE that is fairly close to the average for the <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Electric Utilities industry;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/us/utilities/electric-utilities?blueprint=2485903&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=industry&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Electric Utilities industry</a> (9.0%).",
			"That's neither particularly good, nor bad. Although the ROE is similar to the industry, we should still perform further checks to see if the company's ROE is being boosted by high debt levels. If so, this increases its exposure to financial risk. To know the 3 risks we have identified for Duke Energy visit our <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:risks dashboard for free.;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nyse-duk/duke-energy?blueprint=2485903&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=conclusion&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">risks dashboard for free.</a>",
			"Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.",
			"Duke Energy clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.43. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.",
			"Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.",
			"But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this.

			"We aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. Based on the last payment, Exelon's earnings were much higher than the dividend, but it wasn't converting those earnings into cash flow. In general, we consider cash flow to be more important than earnings, so we would be cautious about relying on the sustainability of this dividend.",
			"The next year is set to see EPS grow by 32.0%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 53%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.",
			"The company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $2.10 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.44. This works out to be a decline of approximately 3.7% per year over that time. A company that decreases its dividend over time generally isn't what we are looking for.",
			"With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. Over the past five years, it looks as though Exelon's EPS has declined at around 12% a year. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective. Even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough. Over the next year, however, earnings are actually predicted to rise, but we would still be cautious until a track record of earnings growth can be built.",
			"Overall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Exelon will make a great income stock. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.",
			"Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach.

			"Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We've accomplished a lot since our last earnings call and continue to build on the positive momentum we have seen over the last couple of years. Our first quarter GAAP earnings are $0.51 per share. Despite the impact of extremely mild first quarter temperatures, operating earnings are $0.60 per share, which is within the guidance range and reflects the continued execution of our long-term regulated growth strategy.<br/>We continue to position FirstEnergy for greater resiliency and growth by strengthening our financial position, enhancing our operations, optimizing the customer experience and transforming our culture. When Brian Tierney joins us as President and CEO on June 1, he'll hit the ground running to build on these efforts. We're very excited to welcome him on board.<br/>Clearly, we recognize how important it was to find the right leader for our company. And in Brian, we have a CEO who understands our industry and business and is the right leader to drive our strategy and accelerate our momentum. I know many of you worked with Brian during his time at AEP, and we know him as a highly respected executive with a unique blend of operational, financial and strategic skills and achievements.<br/>His strong track record of driving results is very well aligned with our goals at FirstEnergy. He has expressed his support for the steps we've taken to position our company, and he intends to continue to advance our business strategy, building on the strong foundation we have in place today. We know we found the right person to lead our company.<br/>I know everyone is looking forward to hearing from him, and we will certainly give you that opportunity. He will have a busy calendar starting on June 1. In the meantime, I'm so proud of our employees and their excellent work to position our company for the future. I know they will double down in their efforts to support Brian to drive long-term sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. This work includes a very busy regulatory calendar that addresses the critical investments that support reliability and a smarter and cleaner electric grid. John will review our recent distribution filings in a few minutes, but first, I'll take a moment to provide an update on our transmission business.<br/>In early February, we announced an agreement to sell an additional 30% interest in FirstEnergy Transmission LLC to Brookfield's Super-Core Infrastructure Partners for $3.5 billion, and this transaction remains on track to close in early 2024.<br/>Brookfield's partnership in FET supports our substantial long-term investments to build a more resilient and modern electric grid. We have a $1.7 billion transmission investment program this year and that's increasing to $1.9 billion by 2025.<br/>The mild first quarter weather, coupled with strong planning and execution, helped us get off to a great start with our construction program. Our transmission capital investments of nearly $350 million are about 60% ahead of the first quarter of 2022 and about 50% ahead of our internal plan. <br/>Examples of this work include: upgrading an 8-mile 138 kV transmission line in Ottawa County, Ohio, near Toledo. This project, which is scheduled for completion in May includes streaming new, larger conductor that can handle additional demand, replacing older structures with monopoles and installing more than 40 new components and insulators. Upgrading the high-voltage transmission line in New Jersey that is expected to improve system reliability for more than 3,000 customers.<br/>This project includes the installation of 53 new wood pole structures to fortify and strengthen the line and help prevent outages. And our transmission program is also facilitating the energy transition by connecting clean energy resources to the grid. Earlier this year, JCP&amp;L completed a grid connection for a 19.8 megawatt solar project located at a former landfill property in Mount Olive in New Jersey that is now delivering clean energy through FirstEnergy's transmission lines.<br/>We are excited to continue making these types of investments across our service territory in support of the clean energy future. We are affirming our 2023 guidance of $2.44 to $2.64 per share. As we discussed last quarter, the midpoint of this range represents 6% growth over our original 2022 midpoint of $2.40 per share.<br/>We are also introducing second quarter 2023 guidance of $0.40 to $0.50 per share. In addition, we are affirming our targeted 6% to 8% annual operating earnings growth rate. This represents year-over-year growth based off of prior year guidance midpoint. I want to spend a moment discussing our regulated earnings and earnings quality, particularly in light of the current contribution from the Signal Peak mining operation. While this is a legacy investment, that we need or control or operate, it has taken on a higher profile over the last year. <br/>Based on our plan, the earnings contribution from Signal Peak in 2023 is expected to be less than 15% of our $2.54 guidance midpoint and the expectation longer term is that Signal Peak contribution will decline on an absolute and relative basis, representing less than 10% of 2024 and 2025 consolidated earnings, improving the company's earnings quality over time.<br/>We intend to continue providing transparency around Signal Peak's contribution going forward. Our focus is on our regulated operations, our state distribution companies and our transmission businesses and on improving the credit quality of the company. We expect significant growth from our regulated operations given current returns in our distribution companies and our customer-focused investment strategies across both distribution and transmission, which will more than offset the decline in Signal Peak and support our expectations of 6% to 8% consolidated average annual earnings growth. I believe we are on the right path to leverage our strengths and deliver value to all of our stakeholders.<br/>Now I'll turn the call over to Jon Taylor.",
			"<strong>K. Jon Taylor</strong>",
			"Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Although we were significantly impacted by the record-breaking mild temperatures this winter, our underlying business fundamentals remain strong and on track. I'll begin my remarks with a regulatory update, then I'll review our first quarter financial results.<br/>Last month, we kicked off a period of significant regulatory activity. Since early March, this includes an application to consolidate our 4 Pennsylvania utilities, which is an important step to align with our state operating model, simplify our legal entity structure and increase the flexibility and efficiency of our financing strategy.<br/>We also filed rate cases in New Jersey and Maryland that support critical reliability investments, a modern electric grid and enhancements to the customer experience, while maintaining the lowest residential customer rates among regulated electric distribution companies in both states.<br/>Since our last JCP&amp;L rate case in 2020, we've made nearly $800 million in investments to modernize and strengthen the electric grid. The JCP&amp;L proposal represents a $185 million revenue increase and supports distribution equity returns of 10.4%. It features enhanced recovery of storm balance costs, expanded vegetation management programs, recovery of program costs related to AMI, in electric vehicles and a proposal to normalize pension OPEB costs. The proposal also confirms our plan to file an infrastructure investment program later this year.<br/>In Maryland, our proposal for a $44 million net revenue increase supports equity returns of 10.6%. It includes a proposal for the second phase of the electric distribution investment surcharge program, a pension OPEB normalization mechanism and a cost recovery proposal related to COVID and electric vehicle balances.<br/>And in Ohio, we filed our fifth electric security plan to support our generation procurement process for non-shopping customers, continued investments in the distribution system, storm and vegetation management writers and energy efficiency programs. The filing also includes proposals to support low-income customers and the electric vehicle customer experience.<br/>We requested approval for the new ESP to be effective on June 1, 2024, when the ESP 4 ends. We've included a summary of the key filings together with news releases and links to the dockets on the new regulatory corner section of our IR website. We received a lot of positive feedback about this resource, and we'll continue to update the site as we move through each of the proceedings.<br/>Later this quarter, we plan to file a rate case in West Virginia. And looking further ahead, we are considering the appropriate time to file for new base rates in our third long-term infrastructure investment program in Pennsylvania, and we will file a rate case in Ohio in May of 2024.<br/>While each utility in each case have unique circumstances, we have noted that recent base rate cases involving other investor-owned utilities in Ohio have been resolved with equity capital structures in the 50% to 54% range and support of ROEs in the 9.5% to 9.9% range.<br/>These outcomes align with our plan, which includes the financial impact of our 2021 approved settlement that provided for over $300 million in refunds and bill credits to customers as well as continued rate base growth and the accounting changes that we previously discussed, all of which significantly lowered the returns at our Ohio utilities.<br/>I want to spend a few extra minutes on the recent generation filing in West Virginia, where we're working with a broad group of stakeholders to ensure we find the best outcome for our customers. Last December, the Public Service Commission ordered Mon Power to provide an evaluation of purchasing and operating the Pleasants Power Station, a coal-fired plant that we understand is currently slated for closure on May 31.<br/>The concept of a potential acquisition of Pleasants was suggested by stakeholders in West Virginia as a replacement for our Fort Martin station, which has a proposed end-of-life date of 2035. We responded to the commission last month indicating that additional time and analysis are needed to properly complete the necessary and complex assessment. <br/>Mon Power proposed an option to enter into an interim arrangement with Pleasants' current owner that would keep the plant operational beyond its May 31 deactivation date. This would allow the needed time to do a thorough analysis and evaluation as requested by the West Virginia PSC.<br/>On Monday, the commission approved our proposal. We will begin negotiations with the plant's current owner. If we reach an interim agreement that we believe is in the interest of customers and FirstEnergy, we will submit it to the commission. And if approved, this would allow recovery of associated costs through a surcharge.<br/>If we can't reach an agreement that is in the interest of our customers, we will file an update with the commission. To be clear, we don't see it as a viable option for Mon Power to operate 3 coal-fired power plants in West Virginia. We will continue to work through the process with the PSC and strive for an outcome that best serves our customers, communities and employees in West Virginia.<br/>At the same time, we are moving forward with our efforts to support the energy transition across our footprint, and we remain committed to our climate strategy and our goal to achieve carbon neutrality from our Scope 1 emissions by 2050. Mon Power continues securing commitments from residential, commercial and industrial customers in the state to purchase solar RECs from our 5 planned utility-scale solar generation facilities totaling 50 megawatts.<br/>This week, we filed an update with the commission to begin moving forward with 3 of the 5 sites, totaling 30 megawatts of capacity and to obtain approval of a small surcharge.<br/>Turning to first quarter results and other financial matters. First quarter GAAP earnings were $0.51 per share and operating earnings were $0.60 per share, which is just below the midpoint of our guidance despite the impact of a very mild winter across our footprint. Absent the impact of weather, we were on plan for the quarter. In our distribution business, first quarter results benefited primarily from our capital investment programs, higher weather-adjusted load and lower operating expenses, including employee benefit costs and the maintenance work we accelerated into 2022.<br/>These were offset by a significant decrease in weather-related demand, lower pension credits and higher financing costs related to our financing activity in the second half of 2022. Record-setting mild temperatures this winter, with heating degree days 18% below last year, impacted total customer demand by 8% or $0.12 per share.<br/>On a weather-adjusted basis, distribution deliveries increased more than 2%, which was very nice to see. Residential sales decreased 8% from the first quarter of 2022, but increased 5% on a weather-adjusted basis. Compared to prepandemic levels, weather-adjusted sales to residential customers are trending about 4% higher. In the commercial sector, deliveries decreased 7% compared to the first quarter of 2022 due to lower weather-related demand, but increased almost 2% on a weather-adjusted basis. While sales to commercial customers continue to recover, they lack 2019 levels by more than 4%. <br/>Finally, first quarter 2023 sales to industrial customers decreased slightly compared to the first quarter of 2022, driven by the chemicals, metals and plastics sectors. Industrial sales remained just below prepandemic levels, but we continue to see fairly strong growth in some of our other industrial sectors, such as steel, services and other manufacturing.<br/>As for weather-adjusted load, we do expect a positive trend to continue relative to our plan, especially in the residential class, helping offset some of the lower weather-related sales we experienced in the first quarter. Additionally, operating expenses in our distribution business reflect the continued focus on our cost structure, and we are pursuing additional cost reductions to further offset the impact of mild first quarter temperatures.<br/>Turning to first quarter drivers in our transmission business. Results primarily benefited from rate base growth of 8% compared to the first quarter of 2022 associated with our Energizing the Future investment program, offset by dilution from the minority interest sale in FET that closed in May 2022. As Jon mentioned, we started the year off strong with our capital investment program in our transmission business, deploying nearly $350 million of capital, which is significantly above our internal plan.<br/>First quarter results in our Corporate segment benefited from higher investment earnings from Signal Peak and lower financing costs associated with holding company debt redemptions in 2022, which more than offset the lower pension credit.<br/>Signal Peak's contribution in Q1 of this year was $0.08 per share, but we expect a slight decrease to its projected earnings for the full year due to current forward market prices for coal. While weather had a significant impact for the first 3 months of the year, it's not taking us off our plan. We expect to offset the weather impact this quarter as well as projected lower earnings contribution from Signal Peak through stronger weather-adjusted load, additional cost reduction opportunities as well as opportunities to optimize our financing plans.<br/>Thank you for your time this morning. We recognize we have some work to do given the mild winter temperatures this quarter, but we see this as manageable. We remain focused on executing our plan and creating long-term value for our investors, customers, communities and employees. <br/>Now let's open the call to your questions.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.",
			"<strong>Shahriar Pourreza</strong>",
			"Just a couple of ones here. We're sort of thinking about the upcoming Ohio rate case. Just maybe from a high level, what sort of -- what are the asks there? Is it primary capital and rate base, deferred costs, O&amp;M true-ups? Do you sort of anticipate something to be more rate-neutral?<br/>And kind of related to that, how should we be thinking about historical precedents with sort of a newer commission as we think about some of the key regulatory items like goodwill and how that may be treated differently in this upcoming case?",
			"<strong>K. Jon Taylor</strong>",
			"Yes. Well, Shar, so if you look at the returns for the Ohio utilities, they've been trending down over the last few years. If you go back to 2020, we were reporting returns in the 13% range versus 8.3% as of the end of March.<br/>Obviously, the seat settlement that we reached back in 2021 impacted the returns significantly with those annual rate credits to customers, the accounting changes that we made around veg management and corporate support cost had an impact on our returns as well as just continued investment in rate base with about $1.5 billion of incremental rate base, which is over 50% since the last rate case, which comes with the associated increases in depreciation and property taxes.<br/>And to your point, if you look at recently approved rate cases in Ohio, ROEs have averaged somewhere between 9.5% to 9.9% and capital structures with equity between 50% to 54%. And that's really in line with what's included in our DCR and AMI riders that recovers our distribution reliability and in Grid Mod capital investment program. So I feel like we've positioned the Ohio companies the best we can, and we're looking forward to the opportunity to file the case next year.",
			"<strong>Shahriar Pourreza</strong>",
			"Got it. And then lastly for me, just obviously, it's impacting the stock a little bit this morning. Just in your cue, there's some new language around potentially using hybrids. Can you just maybe expand on that, how it ties into your thinking around equity? Are you kind of looking at converts in the traditional sense or ones that have been utilized lately with some of your peers where the window to convert is shorter, it's less dilutive, you don't really get the equity credit? I guess, really, the question here is, are you looking for equity credit or not?",
			"<strong>K. Jon Taylor</strong>",
			"Well, I would say our first focus is filing the application for the Brookfield transaction and to get that closed. And if you think about that transaction, coupled with the other transactions that we've already closed on, we will have raised $7 billion of equity or equity-like capital.<br/>When it comes to other instruments that you're referring to, we look at all types of instruments all the time to see if we can maximize or optimize our financing plan and that's exactly what we do. If you're looking at our short-term borrowing rate at 6.5%, 7%, we feel like we need to look at opportunities to find cheap financing to offset those costs.",
			"<strong>Shahriar Pourreza</strong>",
			"Got it. So just to summarize your language around not needing equity has not changed to the plan?",
			"<strong>K. Jon Taylor</strong>",
			"Correct. Correct.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.",
			"<strong>Jeremy Bryan Tonet</strong>",
			"Just want to come back to Signal Peak a little bit, if you could. Just wondering, I guess, beyond 2024, what's the run rate EPS contribution? How should we think about that over time? And is there a strategic plan for the asset going forward?",
			"<strong>K. Jon Taylor</strong>",
			"So Jeremy, we've talked about before. In our plan today, we see Signal Peak's earnings contribution declining on an absolute basis as well as a relative basis. So less than 10% of the earnings going forward. And right now, if you look at the price curve for Newcastle Coal, on average about $175 a ton, that supports that assumption. Strategically, we've looked at that asset before. It's a very difficult asset to monetize, but it is something that we look at from time to time, we'll continue to do so.",
			"<strong>Jeremy Bryan Tonet</strong>",
			"Got it. That's helpful. And then just wanted to kind of dive into weather, a little bit more, if I could. And clearly outlined before, I guess, offset to $0.38 pension headwind, but then weather is probably a bit more of an impact on the plan than when the guidance was originally provided.<br/>And you talked about, I guess, Signal Peak weather just load additional cost reduction opportunities and optimizing the finance plan to offset weather. But just wondering if you could quantify a little bit more how you've seen the weather impact versus plan for year-to-date or expectations at this point? And which of those buckets present kind of the bigger opportunities to deliver offsets?",
			"<strong>K. Jon Taylor</strong>",
			"Yes. So the weather for Q1 was about a $0.12 impact to the plan. Absent the abnormal conditions we saw in Q1, we would be slightly ahead of plan for the first quarter. Now we have seen positive, what I'll call, weather-adjusted load primarily in our residential sector. We've seen that trend over the last several months.<br/>In fact, if you look at the last few years, our residential load typically comes in anywhere from 1% to 2% better than our load forecast. And so we see a little bit of a tailwind associated with weather-adjusted load for the rest of the year. As you mentioned, we are looking at further cost reduction opportunities.<br/>You probably saw, we've terminated some sponsorship agreements. We announced a facility optimization plan that -- to consolidate real estate. And we're also being very selective in backfilling attrition, especially for our non-bargaining employees. And then we're also looking at our financing plan, as I mentioned earlier, in terms of how we can reduce short-term borrowings and we get better cost of capital associated with our debt financings.",
			"<strong>Jeremy Bryan Tonet</strong>",
			"Got it. That's helpful. So even if 2Q guidance was below, I guess, where The Street was, things are still kind of progressing in line with your expectations and these offsets can keep you firmly towards the midpoint of your plan?",
			"<strong>K. Jon Taylor</strong>",
			"That's right. In fact, if you look at just quarter by quarter and if you think about last year, really what's going to help us offset the pension is some of the actions we took last year to accelerate operating expenses from '23 into '22, and we really didn't make that decision until the third quarter. So you'll really see the uplift in earnings beginning in the third quarter.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.",
			"<strong>Steven Isaac Fleishman</strong>",
			"Yes. John, maybe just -- John, 2 Johns, Somerhalder, just a little more color on kind of the Board's thoughts on hiring Brian and kind of what you think he brings to the company?",
			"<strong>John William Somerhalder</strong>",
			"Yes. I mean as we've talked about, Steve, Brian was always someone that we thought would be very good in this role because of his deep experience in this industry. Also his time [at] Blackstone, that was very valuable experience. So we always viewed him as a really good candidate. We were very pleased that early this year.<br/>We saw him as available. We did not before that, but we saw that he saw the great fit as well. So there was mutual belief that he could be the right person. And truly his experience around regulatory environment in Ohio, other locations, all of his experience around the best way to run the operations and optimize operations over time, all fit with our plan. The heavy investments in our wires business, our T&amp;D business, and so the more we discussed earlier this year with Brian, the more we saw that is the right fit.<br/>And obviously, the Board really feels good about the fact that Brian will be joining us on June 1. We've been able to spend some time with Brian. He's been very busy, but we've spent some very good quality time, and I continue to be very confident that he's the right person and I'm very confident in his ability to execute and deliver on our plan.",
			"<strong>Steven Isaac Fleishman</strong>",
			"Okay. And just along those lines, there seems to be kind of -- I know it's kind of hard to speak for Brian, but just there's been some narrative that maybe Brian comes in and like rebases the plan. Just any thoughts on like is that unlikely, assuming people are thinking rebates lower when they say that?",
			"<strong>John William Somerhalder</strong>",
			"Yes, Steve, I mean, we have spent a good amount of time with Brian and provided a lot of good information. Based upon my interactions with Brian, I'm confident that he's committed to execute on our plan.",
			"<strong>Steven Isaac Fleishman</strong>",
			"Yes. And then just on the whole issue with the kind of thinking about -- I'm sorry, just on the hybrid comment, I just wanted to just clarify that one more time. The -- when you're thinking about optimizing the financing cost, this is more of like a hybrid that's focused on a debt-like instrument like TPL and Southern and (inaudible) and a bunch of people have just done and not something that's more equity focused?",
			"<strong>K. Jon Taylor</strong>",
			"That's correct.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question is from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.",
			"<strong>David Keith Arcaro</strong>",
			"Noticed that another phase of the New Jersey offshore wind transmission need was issued recently, and you had success in the first one. So I was wondering if you had any early read, if you could speak to your prospects for this next round of transmission need?",
			"<strong>K. Jon Taylor</strong>",
			"Yes, Dave, I mean, I think we'll take a look at all of those types of proposals as they come up. We -- I don't -- I think it's too early to handicap at this stage our prospects. But something that we're very interested in participating in. We think we're well positioned in the state to provide value and support those plans, and we'll keep the investor community up to speed as we progress.",
			"<strong>David Keith Arcaro</strong>",
			"Got it. And on coal-driven earnings this year and on Signal Peak, I guess we've seen domestic coal prices notch down quite a bit since the beginning of the year. I was wondering if there's any view of a declining earnings contribution for this year, specifically versus what you had been originally contemplating in the guidance or do you have visibility into contracted levels that would potentially insulate you there?",
			"<strong>K. Jon Taylor</strong>",
			"Yes. I mean we have seen some decline in Newcastle power prices or coal prices, but you got to remember that about 60% of their volume was already locked in at a fixed price and about 40% of it was indexed to Newcastle coal prices. So we have seen with those index times a slight deterioration in the earnings contribution for Signal Peak, but it's not nearly as dramatic as the decline in Newcastle forward prices, and it's manageable in the context of what we're thinking about for this year.",
			"<strong>John William Somerhalder</strong>",
			"Yes. I mean there are -- there is a fairly big disconnect between domestic coal prices in the U.S. compared to seaborne coal prices. And the good news is the first quarter came in very much in line with what our expectations were. And if you look at the forward curve, even though it's coming down, it's very much in line and supportive of what we have in our '24 and '25 plan. The real impact we see is this year, the prices because of the supply-demand fundamentals, milder conditions in Europe, fairly robust supply from some areas that supply Newcastle coal, Australia and others, the impact tends to be over the next several quarters where we see the impact. And as John said, that's what we're putting together plans to make sure we have other ways to address that and stay on track with our plan.",
			"<strong>David Keith Arcaro</strong>",
			"Yes. Okay. That makes sense. One more quick question for me. I was curious just with the New Jersey management audit report that came out recently, wondering if you could just give your view, your perspective on that and initiatives you might be pursuing in the state around some of the recommendations there.",
			"<strong>K. Jon Taylor</strong>",
			"Well, it was a very comprehensive report. We're continuing to review the recommendations. I think we have an opportunity to provide feedback at some point down the road, and we'll do that at the right time. But we're going through the recommendations. I think there are many recommendations that we'll accept, but there are probably some recommendations that we'll need to have further discussion on.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question is from Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global.",
			"<strong>Agnieszka Anna Storozynski</strong>",
			"So maybe first with 2024 and how you plan to manage your pension's costs. So yes, I see the OPEB and pension cost trackers embedded in the New Jersey and Maryland applications. The Ohio issue and the Pennsylvania won't be addressed for a while, you'll have lower contributions from Signal Peak, as you just noted, and yes, I know that the market has recovered somewhat.<br/>But looking at your allocation, you have an issue on the credit side, right, with the investments at least based on the latest disclosures on how you allocated your pension accounts. So should we brace for another weakness -- another year of weakness in earnings in '24 associated with pension?",
			"<strong>K. Jon Taylor</strong>",
			"Well, I mean, Angie, I think through the first quarter, the pension has performed very well. I think the returns were 7%. The discount rate had come down about 20 basis points. And we're tracking to that level as we speak today. And so in the plan, we have pension, the pension kind of at the same level we have this year, and we're working to get trackers to protect the companies from volatility in the pension plan in New Jersey, in Maryland and we'll likely propose something like that in West Virginia.<br/>So we are doing what we can to protect customers as well as investors from the volatility in the pension plan. But based on everything we know today, everything is tracking a little bit better than we had anticipated.",
			"<strong>Agnieszka Anna Storozynski</strong>",
			"Okay. Okay. And then changing topics on the other, John, maybe. Okay, so we have gone through a couple of catalysts that were supposed to benefit the stock. The discounts on a relative basis hasn't really changed. I understand that we're still waiting for upgrades to investment grade at the holdco level.<br/>But is there -- as the Board looks at what's been happening, is there any suggestions maybe to change the course? Or is it just sticking to the current plan and then over time, the execution against the plan will basically be reflected in the stock?",
			"<strong>John William Somerhalder</strong>",
			"Yes. I think absolutely the latter. The Board strongly supports the plan. I mean, we view this as -- the most important thing is that we execute on the plan and continue to execute on the plan. I think our track record over the last year or 2 related to the Brookfield first transaction Jon talked about, the second transaction. What we've done related to even with supply chain issues, making sure that we are investing in our business and meeting our schedules on capital deployment.<br/>The Board really views that the steps we've taken to date, the good progress we've made and continued execution on that plan is what will deliver the value and close that discount gap that you referenced. So Board is firmly committed to that plan.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question is from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc.",
			"<strong>Sophie Ksenia Karp</strong>",
			"Maybe first about the Ohio rate case that you will be filing in the not-so-distant future. I was wondering if you guys considered or is it under consideration to combine the 3 utilities in Ohio and what kind of challenges would that present if you were to request something like that?",
			"<strong>K. Jon Taylor</strong>",
			"Well, I do think at some point down the road, we are going to look to consolidate our Ohio utilities just like we've proposed in Pennsylvania. The timing is a little bit to be determined. And so we're just working through that. But regardless of whether we propose to consolidate, you're still going to likely have 3 sets of rate books, right?<br/>And you'll kind of get to parity within the tariffs over time. I think we've had other utilities in the state that have consolidated their entities as well as their rate books, and that took some time. The legal entity consolidation is one step, but then to consolidate from a rate perspective, probably takes several rate cases a few years, that type of thing. So it is something that we're looking at and we'll likely execute on, but the timing is a little bit to be determined.",
			"<strong>Sophie Ksenia Karp</strong>",
			"Got it. And my follow-up is on West Virginia. So the acquisition, the potential acquisition of Pleasants that you're exploring there, I don't know how to phrase it, but is there a way that -- is it possible that if you could pay political price there if you decided to not go through with that? Like in other words, is it almost like an impossible situation for you where you have to acquire it?",
			"<strong>John William Somerhalder</strong>",
			"What we're committed to do is work very closely with the state of West Virginia with the commission. And they've instructed us to do this analysis. I mean we see this as -- we all have an interest to make sure this is in the best interest of the customers in West Virginia, the state of West Virginia. And that because of the fact that the plant is a newer plant has enhanced environmental controls, it's a good question that needs to be evaluated.<br/>So we see it as an appropriate thing to do. We do need to make sure it's in the best interest of our customers and all. And so we see this as an opportunity to truly evaluate whether this is the right path forward. We're committed to work with the group or with all the stakeholders in West Virginia.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question is from Mr. Gregg Orrill with UBS.",
			"<strong>Gregg Gillander Orrill</strong>",
			"Yes. Just following up on sort of the Ohio audits and the ability to -- what is sort of the ability to maybe accelerate those? You've got the stay there. Obviously, it's not a process that you've set out. But is there any flexibility there to maybe get that resolved faster?",

			"Gregg, this is Jon Taylor. Those audits have been stayed for another 6-month period. I think that happened back in February. So you're looking at the August timeframe where they could potentially start back up. But in between (inaudible) and then there's really nothing that we can do to resolve those or to continue with that work. It's just really up to the commission who ordered the stay. And as soon as the stay is lifted, then we hope to get back to working to resolve those.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question is from Mr. Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.",
			"<strong>Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith</strong>",
			"Just First off, coming back to some of the FE Forward conversation, you guys alluded to it at the start of the call, whether that's real estate optimization or otherwise? Can you elaborate on these today on what that total run rate is? How much of an opportunity and offset the pension that is over time, say, in the outer years? And then separately, Signal Peak, was that hedged out to 2025, how much if any, is (inaudible)",
			"<strong>K. Jon Taylor</strong>",
			"Yes. I mean so the facility optimization effort is probably a $0.02 run rate type of impact if you look at the lease cost, if you look at the maintenance costs, those types of expenses that we incur associated with the facility. So it's not a significant driver in the terms of the level of O&amp;M that we spend, but it's important. Those types of things add up.<br/>And with respect to your second question on Signal peak. They'll probably start hedging '24, I would say, later either this summer or early fall, which is consistent with their past practices. But at this point in time, that's open.",
			"<strong>Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith</strong>",
			"Yes. So that's what I thought. If I can, just pivoting the conversation back to where Steve was going earlier about kind of a longer-term view. At what point in time do you think you come back with a little bit more of a longer-term perspective? I also appreciate that you guys very carefully have focused on this targeted 6% to 8% sort of an annualized basis rather than having these multiyear CAGRs or what have you.<br/>But is there at some point where you give kind of a view that gives an extended perspective kind of beyond kind of the noise of what Signal Peak is providing, maybe that adjusts for the pace of rate base growth and reflect something that really is a buy-in from (inaudible)",
			"<strong>K. Jon Taylor</strong>",
			"Yes. Julien, I don't want to commit to a timeframe. Obviously, we want to get Brian on board and get him ready to go with the plan and put his fingerprint on it. So I'm going to leave it as kind of a to-be-determined. But my sense is, we'll give you that outlook at some point in time. But I just want Brian to come in and really get into the details of the plan and really try to drive where he wants to take the company going forward.",
			"<strong>Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith</strong>",
			"Got it. And if I can grasp my 1 for other point. You feel good about the 6% to 8% perspective beyond kind of the Signal Peak '24/'25 period, if I hear you right?",
			"<strong>K. Jon Taylor</strong>",
			"Yes. If you look at the level of capital investment that is needed across the system, yes, I feel really good about the 6% to 8% long term.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question is from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho.",
			"<strong>Anthony Christopher Crowdell</strong>",
			"Apologies for not yelling into the phone, but just quickly, just some more housekeeping questions. I guess, on Slide 11, you talk about sales data, really strong residential sales at over 5%, slight industrial decline. I guess if you could just talk about the drivers of what's really driving the residential growth? Is it people moving into the service territory or EVs or something like that?",
			"<strong>K. Jon Taylor</strong>",
			"Yes. So the 5% when you have like extreme weather conditions like we saw in the first quarter, coming up with your -- the weather impact and the weather adjusted impact, it's a little bit more of an art than a science just because of the extreme circumstances. So -- but what I would say is that the trends over the last few quarters and quite frankly, if you look at our performance over the last few years, the trends have been favorable relative to our forecast in the residential sector, increasing 1% to 3% depending on the month, depending on the time of year. So that's what we're seeing and that's what we're kind of forecasting for the rest of this year.",
			"<strong>John William Somerhalder</strong>",
			"Yes. I mean we've seen the right trend related to EVs and other factors, not really people moving into the service territory. But that's starting to drive, but that's a fairly small issue right now. Most of what we've seen is really just the trend over the last couple of years of usage residentially with people more working from home and other factors that have influenced it and we're now being able to take that into account with our weather-adjusted load moving forward.",
			"<strong>Anthony Christopher Crowdell</strong>",
			"Is the industrial -- and I guess I know that would be extreme weather in the, as John mentioned, are over science. Just a slight decline in industrial load. I think in your prepared remarks, was that more related to just one segment of the economy there?",
			"<strong>K. Jon Taylor</strong>",
			"No. I mean we saw it a little bit like auto has taken a little bit of a downturn in terms of what we're seeing in the industrial sector. Metals was slightly down, plastic and rubber was a little bit down. But we're also seeing some bright points. Steel continues to perform very well. Food and manufacturing tends to perform very well. So it's a little bit of a mix.",
			"<strong>Anthony Christopher Crowdell</strong>",
			"And then if I could switch gears on Slide 8 where you give us a walk-through and maybe a little different path in Julien's question on the FE Forward to achieve. Just I think you removed $0.05 of earning -- of nonrecurring earnings from GAAP to operating. Just how do we think about those charges as we work through the year? Is it likely that we continue to see those charges or do you think that onetime in nature, we don't really see a repetition of that throughout '23?",
			"<strong>K. Jon Taylor</strong>",
			"Well, the $0.05 charge in Q1 was primarily the termination agreement for a sponsorship we had. You won't see that level of cost to achieve going forward.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question is from Mr. Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank.",
			"<strong>Andrew Marc Weisel</strong>",
			"Anthony, beat me to it. I was going to say we'll miss hearing your name bring the brown games, but I understand the decision there. Most of the questions were asked and answered. Just one quick on FFO to debt. I know you were at 11% last year. You're very clear on the 14% to 15% target over time. My question is kind of what's your latest thinking on when you might get there? Given the FET sale and some moving parts around coal, could we see that level in 2024 or is it going to take a couple more years of growth?",
			"<strong>K. Jon Taylor</strong>",
			"No, we definitely have a solid plan to get there by 2025. I think a lot of it depends on the level of proceeds that comes in from the FET sale initially. We have -- we'll see 50% of the proceeds that's a minimum, but we could see more and put that money to work. And if we receive more of the money upfront, then there's a possibility we could be at that 14% level. If you net the receivable against the debt, we would absolutely be at 14%. But once we get the proceeds and put that to work, we'll be in that 14% to 15% range.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Somerhalder for closing comments.",
			"<strong>John William Somerhalder</strong>",
			"Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We very much appreciate your continued support this year.",

The company has declined the purchase offer, confirming that its water system is not for sale and pointing out that MPWMD does not have the legal authority to purchase or operate the potable water system serving the area. California American Water reiterated its commitment to working cooperatively with MPWMD and other community partners to bring approved new sources of water supply online to protect the Carmel River.",
			"\"California American Water has provided high-quality and reliable water service to its customers on the Monterey Peninsula for many decades and plans to continue serving its customers and working to address the real issues of water supply and environmental protection facing the Monterey Peninsula,\" said Evan Jacobs, Director of External Affairs for California American Water. \"MPWMD should stop wasting taxpayer money and reconsider its reckless and infeasible attempt to purchase our water system.\"",
			"In 2018, after previous failed attempts to secure voter authorization to pursue a takeover of California American Water’s Monterey Peninsula system, the Measure J ballot measure authorized MPWMD to explore the feasibility of the purchase and operation of California American Water’s Monterey Peninsula water system. In 2021, after more than a year of careful consideration and public hearings, the Monterey Local Area Formation Commission (Monterey LAFCo) rejected MPWMD’s application to become a retail water utility. This authorization is a necessary prerequisite to any attempt to purchase and operate the water system that serves the Monterey Peninsula. Monterey LAFCo cited several reasons for the rejection, including the financial risk to MPWMD’s and its taxpayers, as well as the impact of severing the Monterey Peninsula water system from California American Water’s other operations in Monterey County. MPWMD subsequently sued Monterey LAFCo for its decision; that lawsuit is pending in the courts.",
			"\"MPWMD has spent over $3 million dollars pursuing its effort so far and is putting tens of millions more at risk by proceeding without the needed legal authority,\" added Jacobs. \"It’s time to recognize that they have fulfilled the voter mandate to explore the feasibility of purchasing the water system and return to their core mission of promoting conservation and protecting the Carmel River.\"",
			"If MPWMD moves forward with an eminent domain action to condemn the water system, we expect that it will be subject to dismissal by the court. A failed attempt will result in MPWMD bearing responsibility for its own attorney’s fees as well as those of California American Water.",

			"<b>CONSTRUCT Infrastructure Academy:</b>",
			"Now in its 11<sup>th</sup> year, CONSTRUCT Infrastructure Academy is an 11-week program that prepares individuals for careers in the skilled trades. Since its launch, nearly 800 participants with diverse backgrounds have completed the program, boasting a more than 70% percent job placement rate.",
			"CONSTRUCT exposes students to innovative solar and energy efficiency technologies to help prepare them to join the local future energy workforce. Participants gain knowledge and experience that helps qualify them for entry-level jobs with good-paying, livable wages. Participants can earn various certifications, including a Class A Commercial Driver's License (CDL) and an Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) 10-hour safety training certification via City Colleges of Chicago's Olive-Harvey College.

			"Since its launch, the CONSTRUCT program has greatly expanded and now includes more than 40 partners – including organized labor, construction companies, educational institutions and 10 workforce community organizations – working to recruit, train and prepare area residents for well-paying construction and related careers. Illinois American Water is ComEd’s newest corporate partner, joining the program this year.",

			"<b>Craft Academy:</b>",
			"Craft Academy, which lasts three weeks, prepares students for utility and construction roles that require pole climbing and other specific physical attributes.

At the conclusion of the program, students are prepared for entry-level roles, including construction worker and overhead helper.",

			"Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Dominion Energy (D) reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.",
			"The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 5, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.",
			"While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.",
			"<b>Zacks Consensus Estimate</b>",
			"This energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.01 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -14.4%.",
			"Revenues are expected to be $4.47 billion, up 4.5% from the year-ago quarter.",
			"<b>Estimate Revisions Trend</b>",
			"The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.3% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.",
			"Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.",
			"<b>Earnings Whisper</b>",
			"Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).",
			"The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.",
			"Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.",
			"A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",
			"Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).",
			"<b>How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Dominion Energy?</b>",
			"For Dominion Energy, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.",
			"On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.",
			"So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Dominion Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate.",
			"<b>Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?</b>",
			"While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.",
			"For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Dominion Energy would post earnings of $1.03 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.06, delivering a surprise of +2.91%.",
			"Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.",
			"<b>Bottom Line</b>",
			"An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.",
			"That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.",
			"Dominion Energy doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.",
			"<b>Expected Results of an Industry Player</b>",
			"Another stock from the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, PG&amp;E (PCG), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.29 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -3.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $6.21 billion, up 7.1% from the year-ago quarter.",
			"The consensus EPS estimate for PG&amp;E has been revised 3.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 6.90%.",
			"When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PG&amp;E will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.",

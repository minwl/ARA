			"The evolving A.I. landscape, PayPal argues, will help the company operate more efficiently moving forward.",
			"“We expect A.I. will enable us to meaningfully lower our costs for years to come,” PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said on the company’s earnings call. “Furthermore, we believe that A.I., combined with our unique scale and sets of data, will drive not only efficiencies, but will also drive a differentiated and unique set of value propositions for our merchants and consumers.”",
			"While PayPal didn't explicitly say the cost-cutting impacts of A.I. mean fewer human workers, the announcement comes comes a week after IBM CEO Arvind Krishna <a class=\"link yahoo-link\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" data-ylk=\"slk:told Bloomberg;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibm-pause-hiring-jobs-ai-210803005.html\">told Bloomberg</a> A.I. could replace nearly 8,000 of the company’s jobs. Krishna added that the technology could complete simple tasks like shifting employees between departments.",
			"Still, the A.I. call-outs haven't necessarily meant positive stock returns. IBM shares are down since the Bloomberg story published, and PayPal stock fell more than 10% amid <a class=\"link\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" data-ylk=\"slk:concerns over its outlook;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/paypal-stock-operating-margin-growth-7955869\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">concerns over its outlook </a>for margin growth.",

			"When asked on Monday’s earnings call how costs and operating expenses could be reduced beyond 2023, Schulman referred back to A.I.",
			"“You're going to see our costs continue to come down year-over-year-over-year,” Schulman said. “And this is not just about efficiencies, by the way. It's not about just cost reduction. This is about doing things better. I think there's no question that A.I. is going to impact almost every function inside of PayPal, whether it be our front office, back office, marketing, legal, engineering, you name it.",

			"In 2021, the USA witnessed a historic-low population growth of 0.16% - the lowest numeric growth since the Influenza Pandemic and World War I.  The first full year of the pandemic had resulted in a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:19.7%;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/03/united-states-deaths-spiked-as-covid-19-continued.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">19.7%</a> spike in mortality, the largest witnessed in 100 years.  This spike was followed by a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:1%;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/07/19/1112259628/us-birth-rate-increase-replacement\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1%</a> increase in the birth rate, rather a baby blip than a boom.  Finally, international migration tipped by 50%, causing the final blow to population growth.  As such, population declines coupled with average age increases have the potential to disrupt labor markets, slow down economic growth, and even threaten the sustainability of social security and pension systems.",
			"It must be noted here that the U.S. population did experience a tepid 0.38% increase between July 2021 and July 2022.  However, a major portion of this increase came from net immigration from abroad.  Legal immigration was up by almost 86%, adding over <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:1 million;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/new-census-estimates-show-a-tepid-rise-in-u-s-population-growth-buoyed-by-immigration/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1 million</a> people to the population.  Net international migration, as such, has been the primary driver of growth in the population.  The figures imply that international migrants must sufficiently compensate for declining population rates in the U.S. if it is to remain stabilized.",
			"In the U.S., fertility rates are also well below the replacement rate, a rate defining the level of fertility needed to sustain population levels.  An average of 2.1 births per woman is considered the average replacement rate in the U.S. However, replacement rate is well below the actual average of <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:1.6 children;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.deseret.com/2022/4/29/23048948/fertility-falling-birthrate-american-enterprise-institute-education-religion-economy-all-impacted\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1.6 children</a> each.  Several reasons are accountable for this decline, such as the inability to find the right spouse, career and lifestyle barriers, and unaffordability.  These reasons have, in turn, increased the median age of women giving birth to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:30 years;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2022-05-06/motherhood-deferred-us-median-age-for-giving-birth-hits-30\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">30 years</a> (from 27 years) in 2020.  These staggering figures greatly emphasize the need for international migration to sustain population levels in the United States.",
			"With zero migration, the population in the States would begin declining in size by the year 2035 and have devastating impacts on the economy.  One of these impacts is already evident in a declining population growth rate of prime-age working people.  The figure stands at a mere <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:0.2%,;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2022/08/03/demographic-dilemma-slowing-population-growth-not-pandemic-root-us-worker\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">0.2%,</a> one-tenth of the figure that was about 40 years ago.  While the <a class=\"link yahoo-link\" data-ylk=\"slk:baby boomer retirement wave;elm:context_link;itc:0;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-best-countries-retire-overseas-083607068.html\">baby boomer retirement wave</a> is also a cause for the decline in the prime-age working population, the root cause is definitely the long-term demographic dilemma faced in the country.",
			"The United States is the number one migration destination for immigrants around the world. Race-ethnic population estimates conducted by the <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:U.S. Census Bureau;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-national-detail.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Census Bureau</a> reveal that, on average, 4 out of 10 Americans now identify with an ethnic group or race that isn't white.  Moreover, 2020 saw the number of foreign-born essential workers increase to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:19.8 million;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/6750b0f0-c851-4fee-9619-295582fd44e8/immigrants-are-vital-to-the-us-economy-final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">19.8 million</a> workers.  1 in 5 of these workers has been working in the food supply chain, sustaining food supply even amidst the pandemic crisis.  These immigrants also played a dominant role in the healthcare services sector, primarily in the same crisis.  22% of nursing assistants, 29% of physicians, and 38% of home health aides were immigrants.",
			"These people have also been primary drivers of economic growth in the United States.  A report by the American Community Survey (ACS) highlights that immigrants spending power amounts to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:$1.3 trillion;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/6750b0f0-c851-4fee-9619-295582fd44e8/immigrants-are-vital-to-the-us-economy-final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$1.3 trillion</a>.  Moreover, the immigrant population is mostly of prime-working age.  This demographic is highly essential to balance out the older native population.  Since most of the projected job growth in the U.S. is primarily in the STEM fields, these immigrants will most likely fill in the skills gap.",
			"As such, there are many companies that value the role of diversification and inclusion within their workplaces.  Some examples of diverse companies in the U.S. include Microsoft, Accenture plc (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:ACN;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/accenture%20plc/1467373/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ACN</a>), and Johnson &amp; Johnson, to name a few.  Accenture (NYSE:ACN) has been <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:ranked;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/accenture-recognized-as-no-1-on-diversityinc-top-50-companies-for-diversity-list-joins-hall-of-fame.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ranked</a> number one on the Refinitiv Index of the World's Most Diverse and Inclusive Companies.  The most notable features in terms of diversity and inclusion at Accenture (NYSE:ACN) are pay equity, gender equity, and LGBTIQ+ Visibility.",

			"<strong>John T. Hall</strong>",
			"Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we share the results of our third fiscal quarter. I'm pleased to share that once again, we've achieved strong quarterly results supported by cloud ARR growth, SaaS and support revenue growth, new logos and expansion of our existing client accounts.<br/>For those of you who may be new to our story, Intapp targets a very large yet overlooked and underserved $3 trillion industry of professional and financial services firms. Our target industry includes the world's private capital, investment banking, legal, accounting and consulting firms. Most of our target firms are or were originally set up as partnerships, not corporations, and as a result they operate very differently from traditional corporations. Within these firms, we target a very valuable but deeply underserved user audience, the professional investors and advisers in the partnership who begin their career as analysts or associates and develop through their careers to become highly skilled specialists and knowledgeable experts eventually becoming partners and directors of their firms. These professionals work every day in cross specialty teams that support the global industry of deals, disputes and compliance. And the professionals and their firms as a whole has to operate successfully as a highly regulated industry, monitoring and managing consistently with the wide unique range of statutory professional ethics and client compliance obligations that they must navigate every day.<br/>Intapp's industry cloud has been designed specifically to support the unique operating and compliance needs of these firms. We are highly differentiated from traditional CRM and ERP systems, which were built for companies selling a tangible product. In contrast, our clients' business is based on leveraging their collective specialized knowledge, expertise, experience and relationships to win business and deliver value for their clients and investors. Our cloud solutions help our clients increase their revenues and returns, operate more efficiently and profitably, manage risk and compliance more effectively and leverage their collective knowledge for competitive advantage. Our applied AI technology activates the power and potential of the firm's data and experience to help drive their important work for their clients.<br/>Intapp is leading cloud transformation in this global dealmaking, legal and advisory industry and our strong Q3 results continue to validate our strategy, specifically, our cloud ARR grew 40% to $206 million. Cloud now represents 65% of our total ARR of $316 million, which is up 24% year-over-year. We earned SaaS and support revenue of $66 million, up 33% year-over-year and total revenue of $92 million, up 32% year-over-year. And we ended the quarter serving more than 2,250 premier firms across our target verticals.<br/>Today, I want to highlight 3 key factors that contributed to our strong quarter. First, I'll review a product update focused on DealCloud adoption, increasing across all the verticals we serve. Then I'll turn to innovation and our applied AI strategy and discuss enhanced relationship intelligence capabilities to meet the specific needs of our target firms. And finally, I'll discuss new developments in our partnership with Microsoft.<br/>Okay, on product. In Q3, we saw continued adoption of our DealCloud solution. We brought DealCloud originally to the Private Capital and investment banking verticals and now DealCloud adoption is increasing within the legal, accounting and consulting markets. Based on more than 1,000 successful implementations, clients are selecting DealCloud for the embedded best practices that we deliver as industry blueprints.<br/>Using DealCloud, our clients can manage their complex web relationships and leverage collective firm knowledge to better execute their firm's growth strategies. Here are a few examples of DealCloud's progress across the verticals we serve.<br/>Benesch, an AmLaw 200 firm and long-time Intapp client that began with our compliance and time management solutions, chose DealCloud to replace its previous CRM. Scott Golin, Chief Strategy and Operating Officer at Benesch told us that the firm shows DealCloud to reduce the administrative burden that comes with managing complex relationships, letting the firm's professionals focus on delivering stellar client service.<br/>A second example is one of the world's largest accounting firms and a current Intapp client, who selected DealCloud to modernize the M&amp;A process within its corporate development team. The firm will use DealCloud to drive overall business growth and become more effective at winning M&amp;A. With DealCloud, the firm's professionals will be armed with more timely and tailored market information, enabling them to cover and win more deals. We also continued to acquire new logos and expand DealCloud's footprint in financial services.<br/>In Q3, one of the top 10 private equity firms in the U.S. selected DealCloud to replace its current traditional horizontal CRM and multiple homegrown deal management systems. DealCloud will enable a unified firm level view of deal interactions while streamlining fundraising and client coverage through a highly competitive selection process, the firm shows DealCloud because of its market-leading reputation, its industry-specific capabilities and our unique market expertise.<br/>In addition to new sales, we also continue to see DealCloud implementations throughout the quarter, including at leading firms like LGT Capital Partners, a Switzerland-based investment management firm.<br/>Okay. Turning now to innovation. During this quarter, we expanded our applied AI capabilities and continue to develop our partnership with Microsoft. We advanced our applied AI strategy with further enhancements to our relationship intelligence offering, which we've been covering with you.<br/>In Q3, we introduced multiple language support for our AI-driven e-mail signature parsing engine that automatically populates key client contact data now across multiple languages. The feature further streamlines the work of busy professionals, reducing or eliminating manual data entry and improving data quality and insights, and it helps us to meet the requirements of our international and global clients.<br/>In Q3, we also enhanced DealCloud with embedded document management and collaboration, now a native capability of our client and deal management platform. Our integration with Microsoft Office 365 puts key document and collaboration tools directly in the core deal and client management workflow, helping teams to work together on the documents and spreadsheets that are critical to a complex deal or engagement or matter. Importantly, the integration also advances our zero-entry strategy, bringing key data into DealCloud automatically while professionals are working in Microsoft Teams or Office 365.<br/>And following on from this product example, I'll turn next to some further progress in our strategic partnership with Microsoft. In March, Intapp and Microsoft co-hosted a legal CIO Summit at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington. CIOs from the world's top law firms took part in an interactive 2-day event with topics that ranged from the potential of AI innovations like ChatGPT to the increasingly complex regulatory landscape.<br/>Harpreet Suri, who is CIO at Polsinelli, an AmLaw 100 firm told us that she values the unique opportunity our partnership with Microsoft brings to the legal industry. We already provide her firm with the purpose-built solutions that help her team to execute efficiently, including embedded integration that extends our Microsoft investment. She expressed excitement about the future and leveraging the significant AI innovations through her Intapp partnership.<br/>And although it did not occur in Q3, I'm also pleased to share that last week, Intapp acquired Paragon Data Labs. Paragon's cloud-based software helps firms to track and monitor employee compliance like personal trading and political donations. Paragon enables firms compliance teams to quickly spot and remediate personal conflicts of interest or policy violations. The employee compliance product enhances our existing suite of risk and compliance products, which are all purpose-built for the unique regulatory compliance needs of our client firms.<br/>We're pleased to welcome Paragon Co-Founder, Jeff Mitchell and his talented team of product, engineering, support and sales colleagues to Intapp. We're excited to have them on board to help us continue to enhance the Intapp platform's highly differentiated compliance capabilities for this regulated market.<br/>Okay. I'd like to now highlight a few interesting client wins from Q3 as we continue to add new logos, grow existing client accounts through cross-sell and upsell and expand our international footprint. I'll begin with a notable new logo from a law firm that is blazing a path in the innovative delivery of legal services, the fully virtual law firm practice selected our conflict solutions delivered via the Microsoft Azure cloud. Using the solution, the firm will implement a centralized, AI-driven approach to ensure that all ethical business and subject matter conflicts are addressed quickly and confidently.<br/>John Lively, Managing Partner and Founder at Practus, told us partnering with Intapp will enable our attorneys to maximize the time spent delivering the highest levels of representation that our clients depend on. I'd also like to share a few examples of our ability to grow existing client accounts through cross-sell. First, an AmLaw top 25 firm chose to expand its Intapp investment with the goal of creating a more connected firm. They opted to migrate their existing time solution to the cloud and to purchase our risk and compliance suite.<br/>Like many firms in the last year, this firm also added our Billstream product, which we acquired and talked about in our Q2 call. As you'll remember, Billstream automates critical prebilling workflows and helps firms to improve their revenue realization and profitability by improving the timeliness and compliance in client billing and efficiency and cash management. Together, these new solutions move this firm toward their goal of integrating all the data across their operations to better empower their attorneys.<br/>Another existing client in the AmLaw 100 similarly purchased multiple additional Intapp solutions during the quarter, also including Billstream to replace its previous prebilling system. With Billstream, the firm will improve revenue realization and strengthen client relationships through faster and more accurate prebilling practices. And additionally, they selected Intapp workspaces to enhance collaboration across their distributed teams.<br/>As you'll recall, we developed Intapp workspaces using technology from our Repstor acquisition in 2021. With solutions that cover risk and compliance, pre-billing, contracting and now collaboration, this large Intapp client is steadily progressing towards their goal of becoming a more connected firm and modernizing how they work by expanding their adoption of the Intapp platform and all of its capabilities.<br/>Okay. And last but not least, a pair of industry awards in the quarter validated both our innovation and DealCloud's continued market leadership. First, GlobeSt. Real Estate Forum named DealCloud, a top influencer in commercial real estate technology. And DealCloud was also named the winner in 2 categories of the 2023 Private Equity wire European awards for best deal origination technology and best secure workflow management provider.<br/>To conclude, as we near the end of our fiscal year, we're pleased with our consistent growth and performance. Our revenue model is highly predictable, and our durable end market with a $24 billion TAM continues to invest in digital and cloud transformation despite some global economic uncertainty. We continue to add new clients and to grow existing accounts, and we're pursuing the significant long-term growth opportunity ahead to help our industry achieve their cloud transformation goals.<br/>Our purpose-built industry cloud platform has compelling value for our client firms, helping them to increase revenues and returns, operate more efficiently and profitably, manage risk and compliance more effectively and leverage their collective knowledge for competitive advantage. I'd like to thank our clients, partners, investors, Board and our employees whose hard work and dedication led to our strong Q3 performance. Thank you all very much.<br/>Okay. Steve, over to you.",

			"Thanks, John, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As John noted, we had a strong quarter with our cloud ARR up 40% year-over-year and our total ARR up 24% year-over-year.<br/>Before I go through our financials, I'd like to quickly review a few fundamentals of revenue recognition in our financial model, just as a reminder, Cloud ARR has recognized its SaaS revenue ratably following a new sale or renewal. On-premises ARR is recognized in 2 parts, 50% is subscription license revenue recognized upfront at the time of the sale of renewal and 50% of support revenue recognized ratably and included in our SaaS and support revenue buy.<br/>Because it is recognized ratably, SaaS and support revenue is more predictable quarter-to-quarter, while subscription license revenue can vary based on the timing of revenue recognition.<br/>Okay. Moving to our numbers. SaaS and support revenue was $66.1 million, up 33% year-over-year, reflecting both new sales to new clients and upsells and cross-sells to existing clients of Intapp's purpose-built cloud solutions.<br/>Total revenue was $92 million, up 32% year-over-year, driven primarily by continued strong sales of our cloud solutions as well as by solid growth in professional services revenue. Subscription license revenue was $13.6 million compared to $10.9 million in the prior year period, reflecting larger CPI-based price increases on annual renewals as well as renewals on certain multiyear contracts. Professional services revenue was $12.4 million as compared to $9 million in the prior year period, reflecting an increased growth rate consistent with the current pace of software implementations.<br/>Overall, we continue to execute our land-and-expand model, ending the quarter with more than 2,250 clients, 572 of which had ARR of at least $100,000, up from $484 in the prior year period. In addition, we upsold and cross-sold our existing clients, such that our 12-month trailing net revenue retention rate was within our recently increased range of 113% to 117%.<br/>Before discussing gross margins, expenses and profitability, please note that I will be discussing non-GAAP results going forward. As a reminder, our GAAP financial results, along with a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in our earnings press release and its supplemental financial tables.<br/>Third quarter results were as follows: Total non-GAAP gross margin was 71.7% as compared to 67.3% in the prior year period, primarily reflecting an increase in our services gross margin and a previously executed organizational realignment of a portion of our client success team from cost of sales to sales and marketing.<br/>Non-GAAP operating expenses were $63.1 million, a $14 million increase year-over-year as we continue to invest in sales, marketing and product development to support our growth. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expense was $27.5 million, a $7.5 million increase year-over-year as a function of increased headcount and related sales commissions to capture new business in our growing markets, along with the previously mentioned organizational realignment.<br/>Non-GAAP R&amp;D expense was $20.7 million, a $5.4 million increase year-over-year as we increased headcount and made investments in our product road map. Non-GAAP G&amp;A expense was $14.9 million, a $1.1 million increase year-over-year as we continue to see some leverage and scalability in the business. Non-GAAP operating profit was $2.9 million as compared to our third quarter fiscal 2022 non-GAAP operating loss of $2.2 million. Non-GAAP net income per fully diluted share was $0.03 in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to a loss of $0.04 in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $53.2 million in cash and cash equivalents.<br/>Now turning to guidance. For the fourth quarter of fiscal '23, we expect SaaS and support revenue between $67 million and $68 million and total revenue in the range of $92.5 million to $93.5 million. We expect non-GAAP operating profit in the range of $1.5 million to $2.5 million and non-GAAP per share results in the range of $0.00 to $0.02 using a fully diluted share count weighted for the quarter of approximately 78 million common shares outstanding.<br/>For the full year of fiscal '23, we expect SaaS and support revenue between $251.5 million and $252.5 million and total revenue in the range of $349 million to $350 million. We also expect non-GAAP operating profit to be in the range of $9 million to $10 million and non-GAAP net income per share in the range of $0.07 to $0.09, using a fully diluted share count weighted for fiscal year '23 of approximately 74 million common shares outstanding.<br/>With that, John and I look forward to taking your questions.",

			"So a couple for me. I just wanted to kind of touch on the resiliency of the end market. Clearly, you guys are operating well here. And I think I ask you guys this every quarter, but have things changed at all? Are you seeing any effects of maybe the banking industry turmoil that might be affecting your target end markets? Just trying to figure out how you guys are seeing the health of your overall target market?",
			"<strong>John T. Hall</strong>",
			"We're continuing to watch, but no, we have not seen an effect on sales cycles. The industry that we call on has supported us through the last couple of cycles, and we've grown right through the previous recessions. So we're optimistic. We have said that if you look across our target verticals, the private capital firms tend to do well. We get paid out of their management fee. So that's very stable. The law firms, the accounting firms, consulting firms have always been very stable for us. The one that we do want to watch is investment banking, although our position there tends to be at the midsize. We're growing up into the larger firms more and more. So we're going to pay attention. But so far, no, we've been doing well.",
			"<strong>Koji Ikeda</strong>",
			"Got it. And then just one follow-up for me here. Last year on the third quarter call, I recall Steve gave kind of an early look into fiscal '24. And I don't think I heard you mention it in the prepared remarks, and I don't recall seeing it in the presentation either. So is that something you're not prepared to give this quarter? And if not, maybe why?",
			"<strong>Stephen A. Robertson</strong>",
			"Yes. Koji, that was kind of a onetime thing that we did last year, kind of as a courtesy this quarter with an extension out to September until we come back with our -- typically with our full year and talk about '24 guidance. We have consistently pointed people to the fact that our ARR -- our total ARR growth is not a bad way to think about our long-term revenue over time and over cycles and we continue to feel that that's one way to look at it. But no, we're going to give our guidance in the next time around.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question will come from Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse AG.",
			"<strong>Kevin Damien McVeigh</strong>",
			"And just a really terrific job given the current environment. John, if I heard you right, I think you referenced 1,000 implementations of DealCloud. If I think about that relative to the current client base, about 2,500, is that the right way to think about it or is it just specific implementations, maybe it's not that pronounced across the overall client base? I guess is there any way to think about what percentage of DealCloud is within your existing clients at this point?",
			"<strong>John T. Hall</strong>",
			"We haven't quoted that number. We are steadily expanding the footprint of DealCloud throughout our marketplace. As we mentioned, we began with DealCloud in the private equity, private capital industry and then the investment banking firms. And now we're excited to be bringing it to the legal accounting and consulting firm is one of the things that happened this past couple of quarters is that we really started to get more and more requests for DealCloud by name from the professional services firms. We're very excited about that. It shows the connection of this industry, how the professionals work together across disciplinarily on deal teams and other types of projects, and they see each other using DealCloud. And so the decision was to simplify our branding a little bit, say thank you to the OnePlace brand and move to DealCloud across the markets, and that's working really well for us. So we're excited about this as one of several growth sectors that we have, and the word of mouth is really supporting the expansion there.",
			"<strong>Kevin Damien McVeigh</strong>",
			"That's terrific. And then just it seems like your -- the relationship with Microsoft is coming closer and closer. With all the incremental optionality on ChatGPT, does that accelerate the linkage with Microsoft? And any way to think about ChatGPT within the lens of your kind of existing clients as they implement that? Because it seems like clearly will be a little bit of pace of faster acceleration, which I'd imagine will be better for the platform overall?",
			"<strong>John T. Hall</strong>",
			"We're very excited about that. We've talked about the overall Microsoft partnership that's about almost 18 months in now, where we are pursuing several tracks. One is a technology innovation track. One is go-to-market, one is co-marketing. On the technology track, we are taking advantage of a wide range of Microsoft technologies, including moving our whole platform to Azure, which is really the cloud provider of choice for this industry for several reasons, including its security capabilities.<br/>And one of the announcements that we made on this call was about one of the firms, one of the virtual law firms that has taken up DealCloud on Azure and another firm has taken up the compliance capabilities on Azure. So we're excited about what's happening there. In terms of ChatGPT and our applied AI technology, we have a lot of capabilities in Applied AI. We've talked about relationship intelligence and some of the other application areas on the platform.<br/>We just had an event in Redmond, Washington with a lot of the CIOs from some of the largest law firms in the world, who were looking at the potential to use a wide range of AI, applied AI from Intapp and then ChatGPT and the open AI technologies. We're actually very excited that Microsoft ended up with that technology because we think this end market that we serve is one of the markets that's particularly high potential for the application of ChatGPT and large language model type technology. So nothing to announce today, but a lot of work going on to what we're going to be able to do to take advantage of that to the Microsoft partnership.",
			"<strong>Kevin Damien McVeigh</strong>",
			"Correct. It sounds like you're tethered to the right horse. So congratulations.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question will come from Alex Sklar of Raymond James.",
			"<strong>Alexander James Sklar</strong>",
			"Two questions on the DealCloud brand consolidation that you've talked about tonight. First, John, I know you have 90% plus penetration of those AmLaw 100 firms. Can you just help frame how your business development CRM penetration is within those existing OnePlace Intapp clients? Like how big of an opportunity is the DealCloud cross-sell? And then I have a follow-up on that.",
			"<strong>John T. Hall</strong>",
			"We have a great opportunity there. As in many of these markets, the traditional solution has been either entirely homegrown or some combination of trying to use traditional horizontal CRM plus a bunch of homegrown technology trying to get it to work for the unique needs of these firms, both operationally and from a compliance standpoint. And with DealCloud, we're bringing to market a system that's purpose-built just for these firms.<br/>And as you know, we developed a lot of the platform directly with the CIOs in these firms helping to commercialize the systems that they had designed in-house that actually were meant to work for their firm. So there's a real product market shift for DealCloud across the market. They are generally on older generation CRM to answer your question specifically. We also are serving a broader category than pure CRM because these firms have a very strong knowledge and expertise component, the information that they need to manage.<br/>And so when we bring DealCloud in, it is helping them with CRM type activities and data and work. But in addition, there's a broad platform here that supports a wide range of knowledge management, deal management and other types of practice management issues that the firms have. So we think there's a huge opportunity for us to grow inside the market. We've got a great footprint, as you say, we built up relationships with these firms over many years.<br/>We do absolutely have beginning footprints with over 90% of the top AmLaw 100, if you want to start there. That was where the company began. But the cross-sell and upsell opportunity inside those firms is enormous. We've talked about the fact that just within our top 100 clients, generally, there's $1 billion of ARR that we can go get if we continue to sell our platform through. So that's a lot of what you heard on my prepared remarks were examples of cross-sell and upsell opportunities to help people appreciate the potential that we have there and DealCloud into the CRM category and into the broader knowledge category is a great example of that.",
			"<strong>Alexander James Sklar</strong>",
			"Okay. That's great context. And then just a quick follow-up on that. Steve, are there any financial benefits or implications that you're looking for with that change? And then separately, the sales and marketing expense growth has somewhat decelerated despite shifting some of that support revenue down there. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about sales hiring for the rest of 2023?",
			"<strong>Stephen A. Robertson</strong>",
			"Yes. As far as financial benefits from the Microsoft relationship, look, we certainly will expect some over time, but we're not really in a position now to start being granular about any of that. We do have nice momentum in a lot of parts of the partnership. So we'll probably come back in future quarters and talk about that kind of thing, I would think, Alex.<br/>As far as sales and marketing investment, yes, we're continuing to invest in sales and marketing. We are growing our sales reps, in particular, kind of in the same growth rate that we've been doing for the most of the year here. So there may be a comparison quarter-over-quarter that looks different there, but we are forward investing. We're seeing growth. Our pipelines are strong, and we want to make sure we capture it.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question will come from Terry Tillman of Truist Securities.",
			"<strong>Terrell Frederick Tillman</strong>",
			"John, Steve and David, congrats from me on the strong results. Maybe the first question just relates to -- it's been like clockwork adding about 50 plus net new customers per quarter if my math is right. Sometimes the 100,000-plus customers can kind of move around a little bit. But as it relates to just bringing net new logos into the fold, do you see that kind of consistently staying in that current range. The reason why I ask this is it seems like Microsoft's got multiple avenues to help you on the go-to-market side, you got KPMG, you've got international expansion. Just trying to understand kind of the balancing act of maybe new logos going forward. And if it could step up versus taking DealCloud and just selling a lot more to the installed base? And then I had a follow-up for Steve.",
			"<strong>Stephen A. Robertson</strong>",
			"Yes. Well, Terry, I'll take this one, too. I think we do see a steady add of new logos, along with good NRR, sort of the twin engines of the financial model here. Microsoft, you're right, there should be opportunities there, but they will be in both areas, right? They will be often in upsell areas with existing clients and in new clients. So I don't expect things to change there. We continue to have growth on both sides of the equation.",
			"<strong>Terrell Frederick Tillman</strong>",
			"Okay. Got it. Well, you took a question. I was going to give it to John. So I want to hear John's voice. Steve, that's helpful. It sounds like kind of more of the same goodness. -- sorry, good. It's good. So maybe more of the same goodness than in terms of those kind of balances in particular around new logos. Maybe, John, for you, the one thing is you were talking about some uptake of some more recent either acquired products or just kind of organic and M&amp;A oriented development like Billstream and the collaborative workspace. What I'm curious about is any kind of quantification on those emerging products? And are you able to, because of the economic time, start to turn the dials around vendor consolidation play?",
			"<strong>John T. Hall</strong>",
			"We appreciate the market's uptake of both the organically developed technology, for example, the relationship intelligence, applied AI that we've been having good success with. In addition to some of the products that we've been able to come out with through acquired technology like Billstream and like Intapp workspaces. We really have a combined strategy.<br/>So there's a long history of organic development of the platform. It was designed specifically for this market by working with the CIOs in the market on a lot of the stuff they had design in-house, but we have used M&amp;A of key technologies that we observe in the marketplace over time to augment the platform, and we think that's one of the strengths of our platform is that we can integrate technology that often our clients have recommended to us.<br/>With it, we're very excited about this new acquisition that we just announced on this call, Paragon Data Labs, which is a new employee compliance capability that we're going to be able to bring to market here. We've got a very strong footprint in the risk and compliance space, originally for the law firms with a whole set of capabilities around ethical walls, information barriers, conflicts of interest, terms of business, a whole set of issues around obligations management.<br/>And now we're able to augment that with a set of employee compliance capabilities like personal trading compliance and other types of attestation management that the firms need to have everybody perform regularly that will give us an even richer offering in risk and compliance for some of the financial services, both private capital and investment banking firms.<br/>So that's another example of a consistent pursuit of what are the areas that the clients are really asking us for, how can we continue to expand the Intapp platform to be even closer to the ideal purpose-built system for these partnership firms and how do we help them both with their operational needs, but also with their compliance needs as we grow the business and how do we bring applied AI to make that a more modern experience for everybody.<br/>So I think you're going to continue to see that. We're going to bring out new organic capabilities and continue to look for great acquisition opportunities to bring technology and as we grow.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question will come from Brian Schwartz of Oppenheimer.",
			"<strong>Brian Jeffrey Schwartz</strong>",
			"John, I wanted to ask you a question on the velocity of the expansion business. Are you seeing any changes to the cadence of when customers are coming back to buy more from you?",
			"<strong>John T. Hall</strong>",
			"Well, we haven't published numbers about that, but we are excited about what happens when you get people to the cloud. the implementation is much easier. People get to success faster and you have an opportunity to come back to them for either additional seeds to other groups inside the firm or additional solutions that you can sell into the firm more easily.<br/>And this is a big part of our overall strategy and a lot of what these firms to an earlier question about vendor consolidation really like about the Intapp platform and our story is that we're bringing them an integrated capability that really helps the firm and the professionals inside the firm collaborate successfully within a compliance framework that makes everybody succeed. And so I do think that the cloud transition is an important part of the velocity for expansion going forward, and we're continuing to drive that.",
			"<strong>Brian Jeffrey Schwartz</strong>",
			"And then, Steve, one question for you just on the margins in the quarter. The business is showing a lot of margin growth. And I just want to know, is that all a function of the revenue upside in the quarter or is the business also seeing greater efficiencies in the COGS and the expense lines, too?",
			"<strong>Stephen A. Robertson</strong>",
			"Yes. That's -- I think the answer is both. Clearly, we are bringing to the bottom line, the revenue success were happening. That's for sure. But we're also -- we've got a lot of initiatives internally on efficiency and they're starting to bear some fruit. We've talked for a while about our services group, for example, which continues to make progress, and you'll really start to see that, I think, next year, the way you might normally see services in terms of its P&amp;L and in other parts of the business, our execution is just getting tighter and more efficient as we go forward. So it's a little bit of both, I think, Brian.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question will come from Parker Lane of Stifel.",
			"<strong>Parker Lane</strong>",
			"Congrats on the quarter. Steve, I actually wanted to just go back to that last question there. And I know it's too early to give guidance for next year, but how do you think about sort of the midterm framework of the trade-off between growth and profitability just delivered 40% Cloud ARR, you have a big opportunity in front of you. How much leverage could there actually be here on the sales and marketing line, in particular, over the next couple of years?",
			"<strong>Stephen A. Robertson</strong>",
			"Well, I think we're going to try to run the business to -- if you will minimize that trade-off. I think we can show both good sales growth and improving profitability. And that's our objective here over the next couple of years. We're in a position now, where there is some natural leverage to the business, if you will, given the size we've gotten to and some of the efficient execution we're starting to repeat now internally on a lot of fronts. And sales growth looks good here. So I think we're going to march steadily better in both sides of that Parker going forward here over the next couple of years.",
			"<strong>Parker Lane</strong>",
			"Got it. Understood. Just quickly on Paragon, I was wondering if you could give us a sense of the scale of that business from a headcount perspective as well as revenue?",
			"<strong>Stephen A. Robertson</strong>",
			"Sure. It's fairly small. It's probably less than 20 people and then include some contractors and its revenue kind of in the low single-digit millions going forward. We think it's a kind of an attractive deal for us though both strategically and financially. So we're kind of excited about it, but it's going to start at a relatively smaller place, and we'll see how we do in working with Intapp and leveraging our business.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question will come from Arvind Ramnani of Piper Sandler.",
			"<strong>Arvind Anil Ramnani</strong>",
			"Let me echo my congrats on a terrific set of results. Just as we kind of look at enterprise tech budgets, overall, you're seeing quite a bit of pressure from kind of across the coverage universe and some of the checks that we do. But clearly, your third quarter, you raised guidance, it looks like things are going quite well. And from all that you've said on this call, things are -- you're really not seeing any of that pressure. Can you maybe just provide a little bit more color because I'm sure you're kind of tuned in to kind of listen to see if there's any kind of pressure that your clients are going to place on buying kind of Intapp, but is there any color you can provide on like what's driving that robust demand that you're seeing from your customer base that would be sure helpful.",
			"<strong>John T. Hall</strong>",
			"So first of all, it's a pretty resilient end market that has supported us to the entire bootstrapped era. These firms do well, generally speaking, in good times and bad, they're not immune to the economic cycle, but they definitely are a better place to be compared to many others. So that supported us for many years. In addition, they really have made a commitment to the cloud transition.<br/>COVID was particularly important as an experience in setting these firms on the path decisively to finally move to the cloud. As they do that, they have to get all of this in-house built software that they developed over the years on-prem, and we are here with a true industry cloud system that's designed purposely for their needs, and we just have the right product market fit for their cloud transition.<br/>And then finally, I think if you look at their revenues and profitability, generally, these are some of the most successful businesses on the planet. And as well as we're doing, we're still a relatively small spend compared to what they're looking at overall. That's a great opportunity for us to grow inside their budget, but we're getting good uptake. And I think those are some of the reasons.",
			"<strong>Arvind Anil Ramnani</strong>",
			"Perfect. And then just in terms of like kind of the value proposition, right? Like I mean, there's a lot of value both on the -- as a revenue driver, but also from a cost savings, from a compliance perspective, the kind of multiple kind of like business drivers or kind of value propositions that you'll have. Has that changed or kind of a lot of your clients now kind of using you for the same reasons or is there kind of more kind of interest? Or are they kind of -- is your sales force pushing more of your kind of cost savings and compliance or more the revenue part or is it kind of clearly no change over the past like 12 to 18 months?",
			"<strong>John T. Hall</strong>",
			"Well, the sales team has done a fantastic job really studying the marketplace, getting to know these clients over the years and establishing a relationship where we appreciate what each firm's strategy and priorities are. We work with them every year on their IT budget and their plan to figure out how we can best support where each of the firms is. There's a range of value drivers. Just as you mentioned, from revenue growth and coverage programs to operational efficiency to knowledge management, institutionalizing the relationships and the knowledge for the firm to ensure against potential turnover. There's some hard ROI components and then obviously, compliance is a must have in good times and bad. So there are several different areas that we look for as we're engaging with the firms. And I think you may say that in some of the firms today, more of the compliance, more of the efficiency value propositions are attractive. But there's also a very strong portion of our market that sees in the change in the economic cycle opportunity for the types of services or the types of investments that they want to make. And so the revenue-oriented part of our business, the coverage relationship intelligence part of our business has a very strong appeal to firms that see opportunity in this change. So it's still all of the above. And there are certainly shifts that happen. But part of the strength of the company is a focus on these markets and really knowing how to play that in each engagement.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"This will end Q&amp;A. I would now like to turn the conference back to John Hall for closing remarks.",
			"<strong>John T. Hall</strong>",
			"Okay. Well, thanks very much to all of you for joining us and for following the company. We really appreciate your support and the opportunity to work with each of you. And we will look forward to speaking again with our year-end results on the next call. Thanks very much.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",

			"Textile is one of the biggest industries in the world. This is due to the simple fact that like food and water, clothing is also an essential human need. In fact, textile lies at the heart of human progress, as the first industrial revolution that lay the precursor to modern day marvels such as the airplane, started off in Great Britain when textile mills shifted to automated spinning. In fact, the central building block of the modern day textile industry, the flying shuttle, was invented in Britain, with other inventions such as the water frame and the Spinning Jenny also playing a crucial role in industrialization. These came alongside Edmund Cartwright's power loom.",
			"At the same time, according to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://iisg.nl/hpw/papers/broadberry-gupta.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> from Warwick University, textile is at the center of the Great Divergence in living standards between Europe and Asia, since while before the industrial revolution, Britain imported cotton textiles from India, after it, it became the world's largest textile exporter. It was the competition from Indian textile manufacturers, which relied on cheap labor costs to drive up production rates that spurred development in the British textile industry. Since the British firms could not increase labor due to high costs, they focused on substituting labor with machines - a substitution that spread over the entire world across different industries over the next couple of centuries and has led us to the massive contract manufacturing facilities for the iPhone in China and complex chip manufacturing machines developed by ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:ASML;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/a%20s%20m%20l%20holding%20n%20v/937966/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ASML</a>). The results of technological innovation in the British textile sector were stunning, as between 1780 and 1800, exports grew by a whopping 14% annually and output followed at 10.4%. In the later years, the output would continue to grow at 5% and exports at 6.3%, ushering in the start of the golden era of British textiles.",

From then until 2030, the sector is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4% to sit at $1.4 trillion by the end of the forecast period. Within the market itself, cotton continued to be the dominating segment - a role that it has held for centuries. According to the research firm, cotton accounted for 39% of the global market in 2021 with China, India, and the U.S. leading the market in terms of output. In terms of products, the natural fiber segment is the largest, as it held 44.5% of the market share, with nylon expected to be the fastest growing segment.

The company is actively investing in R&amp;D to develop and scale its cloud offerings and innovation in AI and machine learning to meet evolving demand.<br/><br/>During the to-be-reported quarter, SoundHound introduced Dynamic Interaction that combines with Generative AI to improve human computer interaction and provide real-time audiovisual feedback. This is expected to have increased its adoption within product creators, driving its top line.<br/><br/>The company may have gained from a growing partner base in the first quarter.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 59% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.",
			"Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.",
			"Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of International Business Machines, beginning with the chart below.",

			"Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.",
			"As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in International Business Machines. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of International Business Machines, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.",
			"Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in International Business Machines. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.8%. With 8.0% and 5.9% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.",
			"Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.",
			"Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.",
			"The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.",
			"Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.",
			"Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of International Business Machines Corporation. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$80m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:if those insiders have been buying.;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nyse-ibm/international-business-machines/ownership?blueprint=2501632&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=integrated-pitch&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">if those insiders have been buying. </a>",
			"The general public-- including retail investors -- own 41% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.",
			"While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

			"Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?",
			"Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about <b>ServiceNow</b> (NOW) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.",
			"ServiceNow currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.24, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 29 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.24 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.",
			"Of the 29 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 25 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 86.2% and 3.5% of all recommendations.",
			"<b>Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NOW</b>",
			"<br/><br/>Check price target &amp; stock forecast for ServiceNow here&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/><br/>While the ABR calls for buying ServiceNow, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.",
			"Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.",
			"In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.",
			"Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.",
			"<b>ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank</b>",
			"Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.",
			"The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",
			"It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.",
			"In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.",
			"In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.",
			"Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.",
			"<b>Is NOW Worth Investing In?</b>",
			"Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for ServiceNow, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 16.2% over the past month to $9.54.",
			"Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.",
			"The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for ServiceNow. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;",
			"Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for ServiceNow may serve as a useful guide for investors.",

(<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:NASDAQ:AMD;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-amd/advanced-micro-devices?blueprint=2501553&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=intro&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NASDAQ:AMD</a>) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 72% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.",
			"And last week, institutional investors ended up benefitting the most after the company hit US$153b in market cap. One-year return to shareholders is currently 10% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.",
			"Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Advanced Micro Devices.",
			"<span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:See our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-amd/advanced-micro-devices?blueprint=2501553&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices </a></span>",
			"Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.",
			"As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Advanced Micro Devices. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Advanced Micro Devices' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.",
			"Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Advanced Micro Devices is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.5% of shares outstanding. With 7.5% and 4.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.",
			"On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.",
			"While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.",
			"The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.",
			"Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.",
			"Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$810m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:if those insiders have been buying.;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-amd/advanced-micro-devices/ownership?blueprint=2501553&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=integrated-pitch&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">if those insiders have been buying. </a>",
			"With a 28% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Advanced Micro Devices. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.",
			"While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:1 warning sign for Advanced Micro Devices;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-amd/advanced-micro-devices?blueprint=2501553&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=integrated-pitch&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 1 warning sign for Advanced Micro Devices</strong> </a> that you should be aware of.",

During this period, the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, which Apple falls in, has gained 6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?",
			"While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.",
			"<b>Earnings Estimate Revisions</b>",
			"Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.",
			"We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.",
			"Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.17 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.1%.",
			"The consensus earnings estimate of $6.03 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -1.3%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.",
			"For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.63 indicates a change of +9.9% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.9%.",
			"Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Apple is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

			"<b>12 Month EPS</b>",
			"<b>Projected Revenue Growth</b>",
			"While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.",
			"In the case of Apple, the consensus sales estimate of $80.92 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -2.5%. The $384.56 billion and $409.65 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -2.5% and +6.5%, respectively.",

			"Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $93.32 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.63%. The EPS surprise was +5.56%.",
			"Over the last four quarters, Apple surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.",
			"<b>Valuation</b>",
			"No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.",
			"While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.",
			"The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.",

			"<b>Engineers can design safer, more efficient traction inverters that improve vehicle range as much as 1,000 miles per year</b>",
			"<span class=\"legendSpanClass\"><span class=\"xn-location\">DALLAS</span></span>, <span class=\"legendSpanClass\"><span class=\"xn-chron\">May 9, 2023</span></span> /PRNewswire/ -- Texas Instruments (TI) (Nasdaq: TXN), a leader in high-voltage technology, today debuted a highly integrated, functional safety-compliant, isolated gate driver that enables engineers to design more efficient traction inverters and maximize electric vehicle (EV) driving range. The new UCC5880-Q1 reinforced isolated gate driver offers features that enable EV powertrain engineers to increase power density and reduce system design complexity and cost while achieving their safety and performance goals. For more information, see <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:TI.com/UCC5880-Q1;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3858193-1&amp;h=3365236531&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ti.com%2Fproduct%2FUCC5880-Q1%3FHQS%3Dapp-hvp-hv-hvpwrconversion_veinverter_ucc5880q1-pr-pf-ucc5880q1-wwe&amp;a=TI.com%2FUCC5880-Q1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TI.com/UCC5880-Q1</a>.",
			"As EVs continue to grow in popularity, semiconductor innovations in traction inverter systems are helping overcome critical barriers to widespread adoption. Automakers can build safer, more efficient and more reliable silicon carbide (SiC)- and insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT)-based traction inverters by designing with UCC5880-Q1, featuring real-time variable gate-drive strength, Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), advanced SiC monitoring and protection, and diagnostics for functional safety.",
			"\"Designers of high-voltage applications like traction inverters face a unique set of challenges to optimize system efficiency and reliability in a small space,\" said <span class=\"xn-person\">Wenjia Liu</span>, product line manager for high-power drivers at TI. \"Not only does this new isolated gate driver help enable engineers to maximize driving range, but it also integrates safety features to reduce external components and design complexity. And it can be easily paired with other high-voltage power-conversion products such as our UCC14141-Q1 isolated bias supply module to improve power density and help engineers reach the highest levels of traction inverter performance.\"",
			"<b>Maximize EV driving range while reducing design complexity and cost</b>",
			"The need for higher reliability and power performance for EVs is continuously growing, as efficiency gains have a direct impact on operating range improvement per charge. But achieving any increase in efficiency is difficult for designers, given that the majority of traction inverters already operate at 90% efficiency or higher.",
			"By varying the gate-drive strength in real time, in steps between 20 A and 5 A, designers can improve system efficiency with the UCC5880-Q1 gate driver as much as 2% by minimizing SiC switching power losses, resulting in up to 7 more miles of EV driving range per battery charge. For an EV user who charges their vehicle three times per week, that could mean more than 1,000 additional miles per year.

Historically, Europe has been at the forefront of ESG policy making and ESG investing but the Bloomberg report said that the US is now leading the investments in the ESG space.",
			"One of the most important trends seen in the socially responsible investing or ESG investing circles is the rise of ETFs and mutual funds. These give individual investors an easy and cost-effective way to have exposure to socially responsible companies. As an individual investors it’s difficult to find which companies are sticking to socially responsible business practices and ESG goals. So why not leave this legwork to the experts and just put your money into an ETF or mutual fund that is focused on finding such companies? The Bloomberg report cited data from Morningstar, which says that money held in ESG ETFs and sustainable mutual funds worldwide jumped 53% in 2021 to reach $2.7 trillion.",
			"As investors grow socially conscious, hedge funds are also upping their activism in the space and many companies are facing heat from ESG-focused hedge funds that are forcing companies to get their act together and stick to environment-friendly business practices. For example, environment-focused fund Engine No. 1 in 2021 managed to defeat oil giant ExxonMobil and installed its two members on the company’s board. The fund, which was not popular until this victory, received support from some of the biggest institutional investors of ExxonMobil, including BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. This shows the massive change ESG investing is ushering in at the Wall Street and how many investment firms and companies either willingly or unwillingly have to give in to this pressure.",

Here’s what the historic letter said:",
			"But not all is good and rosy for the ESG investing world. ESG investors and climate activist funds are facing a backlash from some circles and ESG funds also saw a huge exodus of investors amid losses and tough macro backdrop.",

			"Consulting firms have been at the forefront of the economic boom over the past several years. As business activity thrived and entrepreneurship became mainstream, small and large businesses turned to consulting firms to seek their advice on financial management, accounting, optimizing their business and finding path to growth. As a result consulting companies continued to post impressive growth, and became famous for hiring top graduates from some of the most prestigious business schools.",
			"But major consulting companies are feeling the heat of the changing economic environment. The Wall Street Journal <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:reported;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/mckinsey-bain-hire-new-m-b-a-s-but-they-may-not-work-for-months-d805f14b\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> in April that consulting giants McKinsey and Bain were having to delay the onboarding of new hires from top business schools. Bain reportedly told some new hires that if they agree to wait until April next year, the company would pay them “$40,000 to work for a nonprofit or $30,000 to learn a new language or participate in an educational program.”",
			"But the consulting industry is much bigger than the Big Four. Despite the short-term headwinds, the overlook outlook for the consulting sector is upbeat and there are many consulting stocks which an average investors could invest in to benefit from this trend. According to some estimates, as of 2021, the market size of global management consulting was somewhere between $700 billion to $900 billion.

The industry spans several sectors, including HR, Telecom, Healthcare, Hotel, Real Estate and IT.",
			"Information technology and software remain the biggest growth areas in the consulting industry, driven by a worldwide shift of business from on-premise resources to Cloud, automation, web applications and AI. Major consulting companies like International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM), Gartner Inc.

			"For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. QUALCOMM insiders own about US$146m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.",

			"With more than 4 million servers across 200 data centers—and as many as 100 new data centers expected every year—Microsoft needed a solution to enable it to better track and manage its supply chain as cloud demand continues to grow dramatically. Accenture was selected to help develop a data-led transformation strategy and build a digital supply chain solution that would enable Microsoft to track and manage inventory and racks across the end-to-end ecosystem of partners, suppliers and hubs to its datacenters across more than 30 countries.",
			"Accenture and Microsoft’s Cloud Supply Chain developed two control towers: one to track and record the location of cloud inventory—such as server rack and other data center components—both in transit and at rest; and another to help the operations teams coordinate the deployment of that inventory to the datacenters with the most pressing capacity needs. The control tower solution, built on Microsoft Azure, creates a digital twin of Microsoft’s fast-growing supply chain for cloud inventory shipments, deliveries and logistics operations.",
			"\"Microsoft can now manage the Azure supply chain for its cloud infrastructure purposefully and address disruptions far faster,\" said Teran Andes, managing director, Supply Chain &amp; Operations at Accenture. \"The operational and inventory control towers we developed have already driven substantial effectiveness gains and are expected to provide increased resilience and significant financial benefits. The project is an example of how cloud and digital twin solutions contribute to a total enterprise reinvention.\"",
			"Jodi Larson, general manager of Microsoft Azure Supply Chain Strategy and Transformation, added: \"The control tower solution is a core pillar of our Azure Supply Chain, that's enabling us to achieve better and faster data-driven decisions. With the power of Microsoft Azure, and Accenture’s innovative delivery, this solution can serve as a blueprint for data-led transformation across industries.\"",

			"Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Paymentus' First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today is Dushyant Sharma, our Founder and CEO; and Sanjay Kalra, our Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take questions.

Dushyant?",
			"<strong>Dushyant Sharma</strong>",
			"Thank you, David. As you can see from Slide 3, we once again had a very success with top line growth and adjusted EBITDA ahead of our expectations. Revenue increased 27.1% on a year-over-year basis to reach $148.3 million. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $8.4 million, which was 56.4% higher than Q1 of last year. Contribution profit for the quarter was also higher than we had originally expected at $53.5 million despite the ongoing macro. These numbers are especially exciting to me from a profitability standpoint and demonstrate our continued progress. On a year-over-year basis, our adjusted EBITDA grew by $3 million or 56.4%, which means 50% of incremental contribution profit dollars drop through the adjusted EBITDA line. We believe this is even more compelling if we factor in the macro environment. <br/>Between Q4 and Q1, we had about 400 to 500 basis points of macro and seasonality-related inflationary impact. Meaning on an inflation-neutral basis, we would have expected to drop the vast majority for our contribution profit to adjusted EBITDA as OpEx did not increase on a relative basis. As we continue to make pricing adjustments to address inflation, over time, we believe these adjustments will become a tailwind for us when energy prices were closer to the preinflationary levels. We are also encouraged that our core biller business has been growing well and is scaling profitably, again, as more of our incremental revenue dollars dropped to adjusted EBITDA. Parallel to this, we continue to make investments in complementary offerings in our instant payment network or IPM and to small and medium-sized businesses or SMBs. ITN remains an exciting part of our strategy and is growing well. On SMB, we are receiving positive feedback from our partners and seeing encouraging early signs from the SMBs. <br/>As a reminder, IPN which is still under 10% of our overall revenue, is growing faster than our core business, even though IPN SMB are currently dilutive to our adjusted EBITDA margins. Said differently, Q1 adjusted EBITDA from our core biller business was meaningfully higher than the reported number of 15.7% taking into consideration the financial impact of the strategic investments we are making to drive our future growth. Key highlights from the quarter as listed on Slide 4. From a bookings perspective, we had a very strong quarter, our best ever, which resulted in a strong backlog at the quarter end. This is especially important for us. Having these substantial bookings at the end of the first quarter gives us a great deal of runway to get our clients implemented for revenue recognition in 2024.<br/>To add some additional color here, our bookings for the quarter included several large-scale clients across diverse verticals. We expect that most of these new clients will not be affected by inflation once they go live. Both the way we price these transactions with variable fees and the underlying industry segment itself. These new clients included a large estate agency, a sizable property management company, an extensive health care system, multiple large insurance companies and a large utility. As a reminder, the biggest impact from inflation has been from the energy utilities and not from the other industry verticals. In addition to bookings, we remain laser focused on onboarding speed and related customer engagement. <br/>Our successful client launches in Q4 contributed to our better-than-expected Q1 performance. A subset of these clients also have seasonally higher volumes in Q1 versus our quarters. We are pleased that we were able to get these clients live before Q1 to recognize the benefit. We similarly on client onboarding during Q1 and are happy with improving post pandemic conditions that allow for increased face-to-face large client engagements. We expect these high-touch engagements during the first quarter will lay the groundwork for us to bring additional clients live in Q2, and we are off to a good start. During the quarter, we expanded our long-term relationship with Oracle by certifying with Oracle Cloud in addition to the on-prem solution. This allows Oracle CIS cloud clients to easily integrate with our platform. We continue to see growth in our Oracle CIS client base. <br/>During the quarter, we also expanded our relationship with Guidewire, a software platform for more than 500 property and casualty insurers. As part of this, we have launched an integrated billing app, that is available to Guidewire customers and allows insurance companies to keep pace with a rapidly evolving customer need for a streamlined payment and billing experience. We also completed and launched another implementation of our billing and payment platform for a large municipal utility, adding another state capital to our list of growing customers. Ranked as a top tier municipal utility in the nation, the city leaders identified 3 primary objectives for this project. First, to drive more on-time payments; second, lower customer service costs; and third, increased customer satisfaction by letting the customer -- the cities customers pay how, when and where they want, with innovative payment methods and inclusive payment channels for their entire customer base. <br/>We upgraded our with our platform to achieve all the objectives to position well for the future. Let me now touch base on implementation backlog and how it relates to our expected growth trajectory and ability to deliver expanded adjusted EBITDA margins in 2024. From where we sit today, with the strength of the exiting 2024, coupled with Q1 2023 performance, we have a lot of confidence in our ability to deliver growth in 2024. At the same time, our first quarter results also demonstrate our improving ability to deliver incremental adjusted EBITDA margins and dollars to the bottom line. All these factors leave us well positioned to continue growing revenues and to expand profitability even for the next year. <br/>In summary, I'd reiterate what we said on the last call -- on our last call that we remain very confident regarding the long-term growth prospects of the business. This is especially true given the expanding IP and ecosystem we are building, which we believe allows us to reach a broader TAM and leverages the entire spectrum of interchange from a cost center in our biller business to interchange neutral IPM business, to interchange being a revenue source in our SMB offering and beyond. We are already off to a good start as indicated by our first quarter results, and we look forward to updating you on our progress in future calls. <br/>Now let me turn it over to Sanjay to review our financial results in greater detail.",
			"<strong>Sanjay Kalra</strong>",
			"Thank you, Dushyant. I'm very excited to be a part of Paymentus, and thank you all for joining us today. Before I discuss our quarterly results and outlook, I'd like to remind everyone that the financial results I'll be referring to include non-GAAP financial measures. As David mentioned earlier, our Q1 press release and earnings presentation includes reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP that are discussed on this call. Both of these are available on our website. Turning to Slide 5. For the first quarter of 2023, we delivered solid financial results that were above the top end of our guidance range. <br/>We believe these results demonstrate the strength of our business, which continues to perform well despite macroeconomic challenges still at play. Our first quarter results included revenue of $148.3 million, contribution profit of $53.5 million and adjusted EBITDA of $8.4 million. We continue to experience solid business momentum in the first quarter, which drove robust bookings, enabling us to exit the quarter with a solid backlog. Based on our strong quarterly performance and the positive market trends Dushyant mentioned earlier and our expectations for the remainder of 2023, we are modestly raising our full year 2023 revenue, contribution profit and adjusted EBITDA guidance, which I'll talk about shortly. <br/>Now let's review our first quarter financials in more detail. As I mentioned, Q1 revenue was $148.3 million, up 27.1% year-over-year. This growth was largely driven by increased transactions from existing billers, and launch of new billers and increased activity in our Instant Payment Network or IPM business. Transactions grew to $108.5 million in the first quarter, up 23.4% year-over-year. First quarter '23 contribution profit increased to $53.5 million, up 13% year-over-year. Contribution margin was 36.1% for the first quarter compared to 40.6% in the prior year period. Contribution profit per transaction for the quarter was $0.49, down from $0.54 in the prior year period. Contribution profit growth lagged revenue growth primarily due to continued inflation in the utility sector and mix with larger billers coming on board. <br/>As we've noted in the past, variables outside our control, such as an increase in the average payment amount or changes in the payment mix can influence contribution profit on a quarterly basis. To offset some of the impact of continuing inflationary conditions, we are currently engaged in active repricing conversations with our customers and are encouraged by what we have already achieved to date. Adjusted gross profit was $43.7 million for the first quarter, up 16.9% year-over-year. Operating expenses increased to $41.1 million, a 13.4% increase year-over-year. Increase is primarily due to increased sales and marketing expenses as we continue to focus resources on our go-to-market strategy. During Q1 '23, we made a change to the employee merit and compensation cycle. In the previous years, raises were given on the employees' anniversary, more or less evenly distributed throughout the year. <br/>In 2023, all wages were effective from January 1, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $8.4 million or 15.7% of contribution profit, up 56.4% compared to $5.4 million or 11.4% of contribution profit in the prior year. This annual growth is a result of our repricing and continued expense management actions. I believe this also demonstrates the inherent operating leverage we have in the business and our ability to adapt to changing market conditions as we continue to grow. Other income was $1.4 million during the first quarter, reflecting increased interest income from our bank deposits and effective cash management. <br/>Non-GAAP net income was $2.9 million or $0.02 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $3.7 million or an EPS of $0.03 in the prior year, largely due to higher income tax benefit in the prior year. We'll now discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position. We ended Q1 with unrestricted cash of $143.6 million compared to $147.3 million at the end of 2022. The $3.7 million decrease is primarily comprised of $4.8 million of cash generated from operations offset by $8.3 million cash used in investing activities. The company does not have any debt. Our days sales outstanding at the end of Q1 was 46 days, consistent with DSO at the end of 2022. Working capital at the end of Q1 was approximately $181 million, an increase of approximately $3.8 million from the end of 2022. <br/>We had 123.3 million shares outstanding at the end of Q1 compared to 123.2 million shares outstanding at the end of 2022. The marginal increase was due to vesting of employee restricted stock units. Now I share some brief observations since joining Paymentus as a CFO, then review our updated outlook for Q2 and the full year 2023. Since I joined the company 2 months ago, my initial focus has been on 2 main priorities. First, acquainting myself with everything Paymentus does. Its business model and DevOps operations. Our strategy, meeting the entire team, learning as much as possible about what has transpired since the IPO. And second, doing a deep dive into the financials in order to gain a better understanding of our 2023 budget and 2024 financial goals. On the first point, now that I'm more familiar with the inner workings of the company. I am even more amazed than I was originally by the expanding and compelling opportunities that I believe lie ahead for Paymentus. <br/>We are well positioned to capitalize on the attractive industry trends in the end market that we serve. I'm also excited by the depth of talent and experience of my team members and look forward to working with them and contributing to Paymentus future growth. As I now turn more attention to Paymentus long-range financial model and targets, I'm also considering how we can best provide investors and analysts with greater color on the performance of our business. This includes evaluating our current KPIs and non-GAAP disclosures. While this process is still underway, 1 specific metric which has drawn my attention is exit backlog. I believe our new bookings in Q1 demonstrate the robust demand for our technology solutions and our strong exit backlog gives us further confidence and visibility in the growth trajectory for the company. <br/>Now I'll turn to our non-GAAP guidance for Q2 '23, beginning on Slide 6. In Q2 '23, we expect revenues to be in the range of $142 million to $148 million, representing 21% year-over-year growth at midpoint. Contribution profit to range from $54 million to $56 million, which is 13% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. And adjusted EBITDA of $8 million to $9 million, representing a growth of 70% year-over-year at the midpoint. Given the progress we have already seen in Q1 and our expectation for the remainder of the year, for the full year 2023, on Slide 7, we now expect revenue in the range of $591 million to $606 million, up 2% from the midpoint of our prior guidance. Contribution profit in the range of $225 million to $237 million, also up modestly versus our prior guidance; and adjusted EBITDA to range from $34 million to $38.5 million, representing a 3.6% increase at the midpoint versus our prior guidance. <br/>In summary, we had a strong first quarter, where we continue to build on our solid momentum from 2022, which we have carried into 2023. As a result, we believe we have positioned ourselves well for the balance of 2023. <br/>Thank you, everyone, for your attention today. And now I'll turn it back to Dushyant for final remarks before we open up the call for questions.",
			"<strong>Dushyant Sharma</strong>",
			"Thanks, Sanjay. In closing, based on our first quarter results and the strength of our backlog, we believe we are extremely well positioned for the balance of 2023 and into 2024. We also are laser-focused on bringing more and more of these new customers live on our platform to continue to expand profitability and adjusted EBITDA margins. Our strategy remains simple and in this order: first, sign as many clients as possible to grow the network. This includes larger clients. Second, onboard those clients as quickly as possible and simultaneously deliver best-in-class service. And third, improve operating efficiencies and manage costs in order to drive margin expansion and bring more to the bottom line. I want to take this opportunity to thank each of my colleagues at Paymentus, who worked tirelessly to serve our clients. <br/>Thank you. That concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now open the line up for questions.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) <br/>Our first question comes from John Davis with Raymond James.",
			"<strong>John Kimbrough Davis</strong>",
			"Dushyant, you talked a lot about kind of the pricing changes that you're going to make headed into this year given inflation. Just curious how those conversations have gone in the unexpected attrition. Obviously, numbers were good, good to see the increase in guide for the full year. But just curious how these conversations have gone with your customers as you implemented pricing changes that you talked about late last year.",
			"<strong>Dushyant Sharma</strong>",
			"John, thank you for the question. The conversations are going extremely well, actually. Clients are very understanding and they -- we are not the only ones who are talking to them about the challenges in their vendor network, if you will. So we are seeing positive feedback. Some of the conversations have resulted into actual meaningful pricing increases, which we will continue to deploy throughout the year. But 1 thing I do want to highlight to you and the rest of the analyst community on the Investor Day is that as we are seeing the trend, what we are doing now is, as an account management team or account management function, we are just including the pricing discussions as an ongoing framework. So we think that until the inflation is completely behind us, we'll continue to have these discussions as we are seeing positive trends here.",
			"<strong>John Kimbrough Davis</strong>",
			"Okay. That's helpful. And then just quickly on -- I think when you set out the initial 2023 outlook, you assume kind of no incremental new wins in the contribution profit outlook and EBITDA outlook for the full year. You mentioned numerous wins here in the first quarter. So just -- have you had to put those into the guide? Or are you still excluding new wins from the guide? Just help us think about where the guide is today versus 90 days ago?",
			"<strong>Sanjay Kalra</strong>",
			"John, this is Sanjay. Thanks for the question. When we guided earlier versus when we are guiding now, the major increase we are seeing is based on the activity we have seen from the growth with the existing billers and also increased transactions. We did launch some big billers in Q4 last year, and we have seen a decent growover from them as well. So all that's coming from that on the growth -- I mean, the increased growth in the outlook is coming from these things we have seen. We have not baked in any significant revenue from the new wins. That remains the same what we said last time.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird.",
			"<strong>David John Koning</strong>",
			"Nice quarter. And maybe a couple of questions. My first one, just implementations, I remember that was part of a little bit of the weakness kind of midyear last year and through the end of last year. You talked about implementations being a little slower. Have those picked up? Are they according to plan? Are they actually may be ahead of plan now? Or how are you seeing those?",
			"<strong>Dushyant Sharma</strong>",
			"Actually, David, that's a great question. And I was trying to allude to in my prepared remarks. The post-pandemic conditions is now actually helping us a little bit, especially in the large deals. That's where we saw some of the -- more of the stretching of the implementation time lines. We are now able to see customers, first of all, both in the sales cycle, but also in the implementation phase as well. So those high-touch engagements are giving us a lot of confidence that we'll be able to keep within the time lines we anticipate. So the implementation as a whole is actually on a better footing than where we were last year.",
			"<strong>David John Koning</strong>",
			"Okay. No, that sounds great. And I guess my second question is a numbers question around the gap between gross and net revenue, really. It was reasonably small in Q4, I think a few percent gap. This quarter, it's about a 14% gap, right? It gross grew 27%, net grew 13%. And next quarter, you're guiding for that gap to be cut in half, basically what are the dynamics? I understand the inflation impacts, but what are the dynamics of that gap kind of moving around?",
			"<strong>Dushyant Sharma</strong>",
			"Yes, a great question. The growth of revenue at 27% and the growth of contribution profit at 13% definitely brings a question. So let me give a around what we are seeing and what we expect to happen. First of all, both these are going to converge as time passes. We are seeing this as a temporary phase. And one of the reasons, as we said, is inflation we are seeing and then, in fact, seasonality is a part of it as well. But we have also started adding to some extent, larger billers in the mix. And what larger billers means is billers with heavy volume of transactions, where the contribution margin on these are slightly lower than the corporate contribution margins. So it's giving a temporary impact where the contribution margins seem low. But as time passes and as we fail more, we expect this gap to converge. And overall, we should realize economies of scale, which should ultimately improve our contribution margin together with contribution profit dollars. In fact, if you look at what we delivered in Q1 and compared with the guidance of Q2 and the guidance for the full year, both in all the 3 scenarios, you will see that this gap is already converging. And in the outer years, we expect this to converge even more. So we think it's a temporary phase. And eventually, this will be behind us. And right now, it's a great opportunity for us to see how we can scale the business and eventually get a better contribution profit and margin in the long run. Just a quick point I would add to that is that even Q1 bookings give us a lot of encouragement in that regard as well.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.",
			"<strong>Unidentified Analyst</strong>",
			"This is Tyler on for Jason. First, I just want to start by looking at the EBITDA margins. I mean, they came in pretty healthy this quarter. Can you maybe just speak to what, in particular, drove that upside to price and sort of how we should be thinking about margins going through 2023 as well? Is it still the right idea to think about quarterly expansion on a year-on-year basis? And I guess going off that point as well, where are you anticipating the most margin efficiencies to come from throughout the year? Is it mostly G&amp;A? Or any color there would be helpful.",
			"<strong>Dushyant Sharma</strong>",
			"Yes, Jason, I'll say that when we guided, we were expecting close to 40% growth year-over-year, and we came at 56.7%. So we definitely are all are very encouraged about the results. And the thing that Dushyant pointed out, I will just remind that the company's objective is to drop as much as possible the contribution profit dollars we generate to the bottom line. There's a significant inherent operating leverage in the business. We don't really need to spend the money if the contribution profit is increasing. So I would say that the increase is mainly coming from operating expenses, not increasing in the same line or in the same ratio as the contribution profit is increasing. So overall, I think the operating leverage exists. And in future where that will come will also be from the same. Right now, we are putting some investments in Q2 in our sales marketing and also in Q3. But over time, we expect that the operating leverage would be more than what we see this year. In fact, for the whole year, you've seen EBITDA up by 27% year-over-year at the midpoint. In Q2, we are seeing good growth there as well. So we are encouraged by what we delivered, and we believe that this growth is going to come. And on the top line, just to mention as well on the contribution profit line, the growth is coming from -- it's mainly organic growth and increase in transactions from the existing billers. And we are also seeing traction on IPN as well, which we will talk more as it grows significantly, but we are seeing good increases there as well. So I think everything is contribution -- is contributing in the right direction, helping us grow the EBITDA dollars.",
			"<strong>Unidentified Analyst</strong>",
			"Okay. That's helpful. And then just curious, as a follow-up on bookings growth. It looks like you had a robust increase in that as well as the number of transactions. But maybe if you could just spend a minute or 2 parsing out how much of that growth was from new versus existing clients? And if there's any vertical concentration that's worth mentioning? And then I guess also jumping through that as well, just sort of how we should think Paymentus is anticipating revenue conversion. Just curious if we should be thinking like how we should be thinking about average conversion rates given the current macro backdrop?",
			"<strong>Dushyant Sharma</strong>",
			"I think we have not shared in the past the new versus existing. But you could actually -- it is safe to assume that we work very hard towards the tail end of the year to bring as many customers live as possible to actually beat our 2022 top line guidance, which we did. And then in all ourselves up for 2023, as we exited the year with a healthy backlog. So we have done that. We're also seeing some same-store sales, which Sanjay alluded to earlier. So I think all of those are pointing in the right direction. In terms of the conversion itself, I think we'll continue to take a look at whether we can start to share some of the information, the backlog and the -- and how that converts over time. But I can tell you, as I said earlier, we are seeing positive trends in the implementation area in the overall business just because we are able to interact with our clients, especially the large ones, in the high-touch engagement that is needed to bring them live.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Andrew Estes with Wolfe Research.",
			"<strong>Andrew Lee Estes</strong>",
			"It's Andrew on for Darren. Just a few on the strategy side, can you maybe talk about the Oracle CIS client base and the opportunity that exists within, especially with the updated implementation? And then with regards to the IPN, remind us where you are with respect to executing on the third horizon of that strategy.",
			"<strong>Dushyant Sharma</strong>",
			"Sure. Thank you, Andrew. In terms of Oracle, Oracle is a great partner, has been a great partner. We have been doing a lot of things together with them in the sense our Oracle customer base continues to grow. This cloud integration actually helps us where an Oracle cloud -- Oracle CIS cloud of the client would find it very easy to integrate with Paymentus through the certification of the integration we have achieved. So we are very excited about that. In terms of the IPN itself, look, IPN to us is a multidimensional strategy. First, on its own, you're trying to bring in -- or we are trying to bring in the participants who have been left behind, if you will, through the platform we built for the billers. So what I mean by that is the banks and other fintechs who are left behind, they wanted to play in the Paymentus space, but just couldn't get in just because of the strength of the services we provide directly to the billers through our platform. So with IPN now, we are able to bring those in, and we have tremendous progress there, a lot of interest in the market. But the second thing about IPN, which I think will become a lot more clear as we continue to execute on our strategy is a very efficient distribution model for us -- or channel for us. We have banks as partners, we have our partners, and we also have distribution to a lot of businesses through our payment network, and many of which could utilize our increasing functional footprint of receivable payment payables, expense management and accounting and so on, especially in the SMB space. So we're very excited about that. And so far, we have seen great progress.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.",
			"<strong>Tien-Tsin Huang</strong>",
			"A lot of the good stuff. I wanted to ask already. I wanted to get a little bit more, maybe, Dushyant, on the SMB push with the payables discussion you had last time as well. Just any surprises there in terms of momentum and start to connect closer to the SMBs?",
			"<strong>Dushyant Sharma</strong>",
			"Yes. Thank you, Tien-Tsin. Good question. I was responding about the word surprises. We are seeing a lot of positive excitement about the product. And it's early stages and a lot of discussions early on and getting a lot of positive feedback as well as from the SMBs themselves. Folks using the product, giving us feedback, and we are seeing a lot of encouraging signs there. We believe that the whole SMB strategy and our strategy to build SMB in a way that all of that functionality is available for enterprise clients as well, especially those who use our receivable capabilities can now leverage payables and expense management and all of that, that comes with it. I think gives us a lot of confidence that we are setting ourselves up for a great future ahead. So that's the one I'm able to share right now, but we will share more as we see more progress.",
			"<strong>Tien-Tsin Huang</strong>",
			"Okay. Great. My quick follow-up, just to expand or dig deeper into the -- what's going on in the bank partner side. Given all the stresses in the banking system and all the turmoil, et cetera, that -- have you noticed any change in terms of existing relationships or even prospective on the banking side.",
			"<strong>Dushyant Sharma</strong>",
			"Actually, some of our large bank partners, they're getting even stronger. So we're very excited about that. But in terms of the overall our bank network, we are not seeing any negative change that we did just as bullish as we were before about the entire ecosystem of our platform, whether it's on the bank side or the credit union side.",
			"<strong>Unidentified Analyst</strong>",
			"I wanted to follow up on some of the backlog commentary, you had it sounded like that was sort of what was catching your eye early on.",
			"<strong>Dushyant Sharma</strong>",
			"We appreciate the question. I am a little reluctant at this point to share the numbers. I'll be honest. I'm very excited about looking at the backlog and various other KPIs. Quantification is not something I'd like to go here, but it's -- I would say it's a significant increase year-over-year. And if I may maybe add to that is that where we sit today, and we are looking at how -- where we want to be next year based on how well we have executed against the implementation backlog to bring customers live especially in the Q4 and then what we're -- how hard we worked in Q1 to bring some of the customers live in Q2. Combined that with the backlog and the early success in Q1, we feel good about where we are relative to 2023 and 2024. And one of the things, which I think I just want to highlight is that when we measure the backlog, we take out all of the same-store sales from it. So said differently, let's see if I book a client for $1 million in second half of 2022 and the client goes live in some time 2023, there is some tailwinds, the digitization tailwinds that take place. And then by the time, over a period of time, that customer continues to rise with us as well as the same-store sales. So when you factor that in is even becomes more impressive, especially with the size of the backlog. But we will take a look at it, as Sanjay mentioned, that what we could share as the time goes by.",
			"<strong>Tien-Tsin Huang</strong>",
			"Got it. Makes a lot of sense. I appreciate that. And then I guess as a follow-up question. When you guys think about EBITDA conversion over the next couple of years, obviously, you've had a lot of investment priorities, whether it's the IPN, small business platform, some of the acquisitions. But when we look at kind of CapEx and capitalized software, it is running around close to 100% of EBITDA. So just wondering how you're thinking about the level of investment in the business, what the outlook is for that and whether we could see the very strong top line growth contribute towards more cash flow conversion as we get into 2024.",
			"<strong>Dushyant Sharma</strong>",
			"I think that -- I would say this is actually one of the key points you wanted to get across. And that was that -- we have always been a relatively profitability-centric organization obviously, being public, has some costs associated with it that challenged some of the profitability dimensions we had or the metrics we used to have and then obviously, the macro and so on. But one of the things we wanted to get across was that we have the ability to drop a lot of the top line and the contribution profit dollars to the EBITDA line. And we are already doing a lot with our core biller business the IPN and the SMB, some of those new initiative investments we are making. But we feel good about generating -- dropping more to the cash line, if you will, in 2024, just because even as we are making the investments, we feel good about where we sit today with our current OpEx itself. Sanjay, do you want to add something?",
			"<strong>Sanjay Kalra</strong>",
			"I'd just add that -- I appreciate the question. You see $8.4 million EBITDA; and then in the cash flow, you see $8.1 million software CapEx and hence the question. But if you look at our cash flow statement, even though the cash might have dropped by around $3.8 million in the quarter. But overall, our working capital has significantly increased. So a lot of cash is sitting in accounts receivable, which we plan to turn around in the next quarter. Next quarter, the cash should go up. That's the expectation. And while we don't give cash, but going forward, our planning for cash is either to stay neutral or maybe slightly negative, depending if the software development increases. But overall, all that investment is happening for future growth for the projects for which we don't see revenue yet. And that is basically going to drive more growth, and that's where all this investment is going. So that outer years revenue growth, which is invested today, and I think we are on track in terms of managing cash as well for the whole year.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"There are no further questions playing at this time. So I will pass the conference back over to the management team for any closing remarks.",
			"<strong>Dushyant Sharma</strong>",
			"Well, thank you, everyone. Thank you for being here with us today, and have a great day, and stay safe.",
			"<strong>Sanjay Kalra</strong>",
			"Thank you all.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"That concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines."

			"(Bloomberg) -- A group of firms including Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Microsoft Corp, Deloitte and Cboe Global Markets Inc are joining a new blockchain system aimed at linking disparate institutional applications, potentially encouraging broader adoption of distributed ledger technology in financial markets.",
			"Participants in the Canton Network, which will start testing some features in July, say the system offers better privacy and controls than currently available. At the same time, it will achieve a scale and standard appropriate for financial institutions, according to a statement released by the companies on Tuesday.",
			"Other firms participating include Digital Asset, ASX, BNP Paribas, Broadridge, Deutsche Börse Group, Cumberland, Moody’s, Paxos, and SBI Digital Asset Holdings. The network will bind together blockchain apps that were created using Daml — a smart-contract language created by Digital Asset, the blockchain startup formerly led by ex JPMorgan senior executive Blythe Masters and backed by some of the world’s largest financial institutions.",
			"Banks and other large corporations have been developing and testing blockchain applications for years in the hope they can simplify and speed up some of their most complex processes.",
			"Part of the effort has revolved around exploring ways to transform traditional securities, like stocks and bonds, into tokens on a blockchain. Others have focused on speeding up trading and settlement of various assets, or facilitating international payments. While various systems have been tested and some applications have gone live, such blockchain networks have yet to be taken up on a large scale.",
			"Part of what’s holding the existing applications back is their inability to connect different blockchain systems built by various organizations, while at the same time allowing creators to retain the controls and privacy required in regulated financial markets, the network’s proponents said. As a so-called “network of networks,” Canton claims it can overcome this by allowing systems to work together without requiring the entities that run them give up control.",
			"This may also enable firms to link in systems that are separate in today’s market — for example, asset registries and cash payment systems, the statement said.",
			"Growing Reach",
			"Currently, Canton can connect existing applications built using Daml — such as Goldman’s Digital Asset Platform, a system for issuing assets on the blockchain — with Deutsche Börse Group’s D7 post trade platform, the statement said. The network’s reach should grow as more applications are built using this coding language.",
			"Systems like Canton are “a key building block for future digital and distributed financial market infrastructures,” according to Jens Hachmeister, head of issuer services and new digital markets at Deutsche Börse Group.",
			"While the initiative has gained the support of around 30 firms, there have been several blockchain consortia in finance with high profile participants throughout the years. Their level of success has varied.",
			"Large blockchain projects in finance are complex: new technology must be deployed across numerous firms operating in regulated markets. The complexity has in some cases resulted in projects being delayed, paused or scrapped. Most notably in November Australia’s main exchange operator ASX announced that it was reassessing plans to replace its settlement and clearing platform with a blockchain based-system that it had planned to build in partnership with Digital Asset.",

			"OAKLAND, California (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp on Tuesday launched watsonx, a new artificial intelligence and data platform to help companies integrate AI in their business.",
			"The new AI platform launch comes over a decade after IBM's software called Watson got attention for winning the game show Jeopardy. IBM at the time said Watson could “learn” and process human language. But Watson's high cost at the time made it a challenge for companies to use, according to Reuters reporting.",
			"Fast forward a decade, chatbot ChatGPT's overnight success is making AI adoption at companies a focus, and IBM is looking to grab new business. This time, the lower cost of implementing the large language AI models means the chances of success are high, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna told Reuters ahead of the company's annual Think conference.",
			"\"When something becomes 100 times cheaper, it really sets up an attraction that's very, very different,\" said Krishna. \"The first barrier to create the model is high, but once you've done that, to adapt that model for a hundred or a thousand different tasks is very easy and can be done by a non-expert.\"",
			"Krishna said AI could reduce certain back office jobs at IBM in the coming years. \"That doesn't mean the total employment decreases,\" he said about some media reports talking about IBM pausing hiring for thousands of jobs that AI could replace.",
			"\"That gives the ability to plow a lot more investment into value-creating activities...We hired more people than were let go because we're hiring into areas where there is a lot more demand from our clients.\"",
			"He added that IBM was also embracing a more open ecosystem and partnering with open-source AI software development hub Hugging Face and others.",
			"IBM said companies can use the watsonx platform to train and deploy AI models, automatically generate code using natural language and use various large language models built for different purposes such as chemical creation or climate change modeling.",

			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> So <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:WeChat is a superapp;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://qz.com/1167024/all-the-things-you-can-and-cant-do-with-your-wechat-account-in-china\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WeChat is a superapp</a>, which WeChat called itself, where basically you get a bunch of services that you would need sort of for your daily life and you would have everything in one place.",
			"So whether it’s like you want to book a movie ticket, you want to book a flight, you want to book some dinner, you want to order food in or book a cab, all of that is kind of in one place, and you also pay for it through the app itself. So it’s just <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:an ecosystem where you’re sort of locked in;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://qz.com/1613489/how-wechat-put-the-internet-in-chinas-hands\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an ecosystem where you’re sort of locked in</a>.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> Walk me through one day in the life of a WeChat user in China.",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> So I don’t even know if an average Chinese user would shut that app at all, because on your way to work, you’re probably chatting with somebody on it. You’re sending videos and gifs. You get to your office, you know, you’ll need to probably use it to scan into the workplace as well. Same thing happens at lunch, even if you’ve gone out, when it comes time to pay, you’d want to scan your WeChat QR code and pay instead of taking out your credit card. Same thing when you’re heading back home, you know, you want to watch videos on your way back, you want to watch content… that’s all in that app. So I think the unique thing about WeChat and, like, China is that we’re doing all the things that anybody with a smartphone does, but we’re doing it all in one place, probably without exiting it.",
			"So that in-app use time is just through the roof.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> Let’s say you’re a normal WeChat user, could you spend a day without it on your phone?",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> I mean, you could, if you want to be cut off from a lot of things, I think. If you don’t want to talk to people or if you don’t want to pay for things easily, sure. But I wouldn’t recommend it.",
			"<strong>Scott: </strong>Right.",
			"<strong>Ananya: </strong>There are not many competitive apps. We don’t have bigger Western apps that would compete with a WeChat, so it automatically becomes the default option because you don’t have anywhere else to go. And then if you are also going to download, say, a food delivery app, you can just do all of that in one place.",
			"So you could get the separate apps, but the system is just so convenient that everyone just kind of uses it. But if it’s, like, a Sunday and you’re just, like, strolling and not trying to get much done, then you could carry cash and you could kind of get by. If you’re local and you have a local SIM and you can make calls instead of texting and things, but it will get difficult over time, I think.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> Over a week or a month, it might be harder to avoid this app, right?",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> Yeah. Then you just have to befriend somebody who does everything for you.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> Right, exactly. It’s all of the people I know—they’ll never have Venmo, but their husband or their wife does, and that’s how they get by.",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> Yeah. It’s a communal app-sharing.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> Exactly. What makes it super, why is it more than, I mean, Facebook does a lot of different things. Instagram does a lot of different things. Why is WeChat a superapp?",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> So I think there’s two main kind of components to it. One is that you have, like, apps within apps. So for instance, if I want to order Starbucks, I don’t need to go to a separate app and kind of order that. I can do it within WeChat because all these businesses partner with them. And the other thing is also, like, the ability to be able to pay without leaving that app.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> So it’s the main mediator between a lot of businesses and the Chinese population. Is that right?",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> Correct. It’s often the only one.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> I think it’s hard for people outside of China to understand just <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:how important WeChat is to basically everything in China;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://qz.com/emails/quartz-company/2106425/__trashed-22\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">how important WeChat is to basically everything in China</a>, explain it to an American or someone that doesn’t understand how central WeChat is.",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> You know, for small transactions there are merchants that won’t accept anything else, they won’t accept cards and things. And obviously cash is an option and it always has been, but nowadays you’ll hear of people kind of not having change and not being receptive to it. The other thing is that WeChat was kind of made off the back of QQ.",
			"So Tencent, the parent company, used to have a social networking app called QQ, and they managed to kind of use that network effect and migrate everybody over by giving them free WeChat accounts when it first started out. And so immediately there were, like, billions of people joining the app. It has a Facebook kind of newsfeed situation that was curated by algorithms, but also it gave the state sort of power to disseminate their messaging. So just everything kind of worked in favor to keep everyone within the app.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> How did the Chinese app ecosystem form this way?",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> So I think a lot of it has to do with the kind of devices that they have. The smartphones were really underpowered. They really were low on space, and I think just having those multiple apps was just expensive and people didn’t have the devices to afford it. So that was a big part of it.",
			"In China, it was just a lot of people coming online, smartphone-first, they were not used to desktops, they were not used to websites. They kind of just had their phone and then they had this app, and it was just a very natural sort of rapid progression from there.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> Right. And can you just explain the Chinese internet in basic terms to maybe our Western listeners who don’t fully understand how separate everything is?",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> Yeah, it’s very closed off. It’s very domestic-heavy. Like you won’t find an Uber or an Airbnb or a Google or a Facebook there. All of those mainstream apps are blocked out. So you do have local companies and you do have local apps kind of substituting for them.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> And the Chinese population is so enormous that it’s pretty viable to just have a domestic internet business, right?",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> Correct. Especially because it’s sort of homogenous. Like, if you talk about India, we have a lot of different languages. We have a lot of different cultures, we have a lot of different economic classes, everything, compared to China, which obviously they also have different stratas, but generally it’s a more homogenous population.",
			"Also because the regime—like if you have an authoritarian regime versus a democracy—it makes a difference in how sort of technology and information is disseminated. So I think those conditions also helped.",
			"<strong>Scott: </strong>Are there other <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:superapps in China;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://qz.com/1690192/here-are-four-apps-to-understand-chinas-grassroots-consumers\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">superapps in China</a>?",
			"<strong>Ananya: </strong>So I think the one that comes closest would be <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Alipay;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://qz.com/1603186/all-the-things-you-can-and-cannot-do-on-alipay\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Alipay</a>, which is Jack Ma’s Alibaba’s payment app, which initially started off kind of like an Amazon pay where you just pay on the e-commerce site.",
			"But now it’s gotten bigger. It allows international cards as well. It lets you pay different merchants, but it doesn’t come with all the features that WeChat has.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> And is it the case that as you get more and more rural in China, WeChat maybe becomes less central? Or is it pretty pervasive throughout the entire country?",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> It’s actually pretty pervasive because what we were discussing just earlier about most people having the smartphone, even if it’s the cheapest one, and the fact that vendors, they have bank accounts. A lot of the populations tend to be unbanked, but China’s not one of them.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> Right. Does WeChat kind of play a gatekeeper role in the Chinese tech ecosystem in a similar way that Apple and Google do with their app marketplaces in the West?",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> So I think what’s important to remember about Apple’s App Store is that it’s very driven by kind of having control of what other developers are doing on the platform. So, for instance, the reason you don’t allow a plugin or the reason that you don’t allow payments to go through without the in-app purchase is essentially a way of monitoring and surveillance.",
			"But when it comes to WeChat and Tencent, I think it does, yes, lock people in, but it’s not like it’s cherry-picking in terms of who can be on it—domestic vendors or international vendors. The idea with WeChat is more to have everybody there.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> Yeah. It’s funny that you mentioned surveillance and privacy when I bring up Apple, because one of the first things I think about with WeChat is its proximity to the Chinese government and kind of the expectation that there is not a ton of wiggle room between that company and the government. Is that a fair evaluation? Are WeChat communications being monitored closely by the Chinese government?",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> So of course WeChat will say otherwise, you know, WeChat won’t agree that they are being monitored, or they won’t explicitly say it. But there have been times when, yes, it has been a point of concern. Like, there was a 2017 report by Toronto Citizen Lab, which found that, in a chat, if it said “human rights lawyer,” whether it was in Chinese or English, it would get retracted.",
			"Like the person wouldn’t receive that message, but the sender didn’t know why that was happening at all. But Amnesty International ranked it 0 out of 100 in terms of, like, any kind of transparency.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> Yeah, 0 out of 100 is not a great score. I realize I never asked you a really important question. How does WeChat make money?",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> Oh, so WeChat makes money the same way that a lot of apps do, where they will, you know, charge merchants for putting their storefronts on the app, take a cut out of certain services that they provide. So it’s the same way that a lot of apps make money: It starts off free and then there are things built into it that own commission for the app.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> Does WeChat make money off of advertising too?",
			"<strong>Ananya: </strong>Yes, it does.",
			"<strong>Scott: </strong>Before we move on, I want to ask about some of the things we were kind of hinting about earlier between WeChat status in India and the United States. <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:What happened with WeChat in India?;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://qz.com/india/1522956/why-kavin-mittals-hike-could-not-be-chinas-wechat-for-india\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">What happened with WeChat in India?</a> Why can’t users access it anymore?",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> So in June, 2021, there was a standoff at the India-China border. And in retaliation, the government, citing national security concerns, <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:blocked a bunch of apps;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://qz.com/india/1875160/among-59-chinese-apps-india-banned-is-weibo-that-modi-had-joined\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blocked a bunch of apps</a>, I think over 100 or closer to 200 apps. And among them you had Weibo, you had WeChat, you had <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:TikTok;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://qz.com/1875132/india-bans-tiktok-to-send-a-message-to-china\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TikTok</a>. So WeChat was kind of a casualty in that.",
			"<strong>Scott: </strong>What happened with WeChat in the US?",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> So WeChat launched in the US, and it intended to do what it did for China, but the network effects just didn’t exist, there was no existing base. So that’s kind of your first hurdle, that you’re not getting people to get their friends and family on, because no one’s really using it.",
			"The second thing is, you know, even when they made it in China, using the user data from QQ and kind of developing it to suit those users, the rules are not as tight around data and privacy, so Tencent could kind of tailor the app to service the Chinese consumer a lot better than they could in the US or elsewhere in the European Union.",
			"<strong>Scott: </strong>Right.",
			"<strong>Ananya: </strong>And then also, like when you have an app, you can’t always launch with everything. So up until 2016 you couldn’t book an Uber, you couldn’t get food delivery, so it was like a pared down version of the app that China had already been using for yours and it just didn’t catch on because the usual American consumer already had apps for everything and sometimes multiple, like if you have the New York Times app and also the Quartz app, two kind of food delivery apps. So WeChat took too long to kind of fill that gap and become the app for everything.",
			"<strong>Scott: </strong>And there was some politics at play, too. <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Trump wasn’t super happy with WeChat.;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://qz.com/emails/quartz-membership/1894283/for-quartz-members-whither-wechat\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Trump wasn’t super happy with WeChat.</a> What happened there?",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> Yeah, so with WeChat, I think it’s the same data privacy issues that we’re talking about, and just the fact that they are so close to the—or at least they appear—so close to the Chinese government. I think there was concern, uh, about, you know, even things like: the algorithmic feed would kind of give you information that wasn’t maybe what the global news organizations were telling you about Hong Kong or about what’s going on in China.",
			"And so it did feel like there was some kind of manufacturing. There was some kind of state getting involved and I think Trump was, like other governments, referring to national security concerns.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> Right. What’s interesting is that a judge in the United States said that, because banning WeChat was interrupting the free communication of people that were trying to talk to their friends and family back home in China, and even though that was a small population, that was a big enough First Amendment problem here in the United States to halt that WeChat ban.",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> Yeah, 100%. I think even now in conversation, when you see <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Biden or somebody from his administration;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://qz.com/tiktok-us-ban-china-owners-bytedance-sale-1850231740\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Biden or somebody from his administration</a> speak, they talk about how China doesn’t let you know a Facebook or a Google in, but “we let TikTok stay. We let WeChat stay,” you know?",
			"And because there is a huge immigrant population, you hear stories of people talking to their grandparents back home, people who have established so many business contacts, and WeChat is one of those apps which lets you only locally store data so they don’t have backup servers and things. So essentially, if you’re a business person in America and you have, like, 500 contacts in China, if we ban it one day and you didn’t have time to back it up, that’s it. They’re gone. So it is a valid concern.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> Right, and it would be difficult to sustain those business relationships without WeChat and do business from America to China. Is WeChat more powerful than the phone-makers itself?",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> Yeah, I think when Apple started out, it tried to behave the way it does in all markets and it wanted to be, kind of, you know, the authority, but it quickly realized that China has its own set of rules. And you kind of have to play by them to stay in there because they would kick anybody out.",
			"They’ve kicked Google out. They’ve kicked Facebook out. So there is a lot of pacifying that kind of goes into that relationship as well. And just allowing WeChat, which technically does not comply with all their rules—like having an interface separately or allowing payments without making the in-app purchase, which gives Apple a cut—all of those do violate the rules, but it’s still an exception that’s made. So Apple is a little flexible in that market.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> So let’s go back to 2009. Apple is introducing its App Store for the first time. Why was that an important moment in the history of the mobile phone?",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> So I think Apple kind of set the tone for what that phone was going to be used like, and who the people were who were going to give you the services that you wanted.",
			"And I think a big part of that was established in creating the Apple App Store and kind of deciding how many developers would be on it, what kind of developers would be on it, what kind of vetting processes Apple puts in place, and, you know, what the motivations behind that are",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> And why did Apple open itself up and allow third party developers to join the app store and to sell their products?",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> Yeah, so I think that with Apple, you wouldn’t have imagined doing it all because the market is so different to the Chinese market. So you’re not striving for a WeChat. What you’re striving to do is still be that ecosystem that houses a WeChat and other things.",
			"So I think Apple decided to kind of let the developers in, create a sense of, you know, competition and drive more innovation, which is kind of <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:the pillar that the Federal Trade Commission also stands on today;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://qz.com/ftc-ban-non-compete-agreements-clause-1849954182\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the pillar that the Federal Trade Commission also stands on today</a>, right? Like, they want you to not have so many integrations, and they want things to be separate so that there can be more competition and more innovation. And I think that’s why they opened it up.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> There’s a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:stronger antitrust authority in the United States;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://qz.com/antitrust-cases-big-tech-2023-guide-1849995493\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">stronger antitrust authority in the United States</a> that wants to separate the people who own the platform from the people who are providing services on it.",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> Absolutely, because that way you can’t tell people what they should be using. You give people the choice of what they want to use.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> I remember very vividly watching early Apple commercials and seeing the tagline “There’s an app for that,” and they would show Pandora radio, and this app called Urban Spoon was always on the, the commercials and it just looked enchanting to see the mobile internet in a new way at the time. And it was just a great marketing tool for Apple.",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> You know, they sort of sold the phone as something that can give you everything without having to do the sort of heavy lifting that you’d have to do if you were to create all of these individual apps. And I think, you know, when I was talking to Phillip Shoemaker who co-wrote the guidelines on the Apple Store with Steve Jobs, he was basically talking about how Apple never really had an issue with having an app that can do multiple things.",
			"The issue that they had was more that they wanted to build an app culture where the user was getting just what they wanted. It was a way of kind of controlling what the user is paying for, right? So it’s part taking control and part also taking responsibility.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> And what was that original Apple business model? How did Apple and then later Google make money?",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> So I think they quickly realized that, uh, it’s great to have people come on your store and, you know, give services to people, but somewhere you have to figure out a way to take a cut as well. That’s where your plugins in your in-app purchases and things come in where they can take a slice of that. And that also kind of serves as a filter, right? So if apps are not willing to do that, then they’re restricted in the services that they can provide. And eventually the ones that end up doing well are the ones that can give more services, and Apple gets a cut out of it as well. And it’s the same with the Google Play Store.",
			"<strong>Scott: </strong>And what was Apple’s cut?",
			"<strong>Ananya: </strong>So as of right now, apple’s cut is 30%.",
			"<strong>Scott: </strong>Right, there are some exceptions. Smaller cuts for small businesses. Some apps are exempted entirely. But ultimately Apple has made an enormous amount of money off of taking a pretty decent-sized cut from mobile developers as kind of the only game in town.",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> Correct. And I think the backlash has also been pretty big because of that.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> Coming up, we’ll talk about whether or not a superapp will take over the Western market and who might build it. But first, a quick break.",
			"OK we’re back with <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Quartz’s Ananya Bhattacharya;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://qz.com/author/ananya-b\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Quartz’s Ananya Bhattacharya</a>. And Ananya, my big question is when am I going to get a superapp? Why isn’t there one in the US?",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> So I think the answer is kind of two-pronged. One is just, you know, simple consumer habits. People were already used to having separate apps, having phones with a lot of storage, and having, you know, easy access to the internet.",
			"So it just didn’t occur. And just regulation, just building this app itself, like who is going to take charge and build this app and kind of deal with scrutiny that comes with ride hailing and also with fintech, and also with food delivery. It just seems like a task.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> Right. I feel like Americans get a bad rap for just, like, taking the easy way out of everything. But it’s funny that our consumer habits are just being used to using a different app for every single thing. You know, paying on Venmo and ride hailing with Uber or Lyft, there is still an app for that. Even, you know, 15 years later.",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> Right, but you could argue that that’s the lazy part, right? That you’re not changing the habits.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> Right. There’s always that. Is there an argument to be made that one of the big US tech giants does have a superapp? I’m thinking about Facebook in particular.",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> in particular. Yeah, I was just going to say, so Facebook—Meta, now—is definitely a player that’s been trying, and we also know that they’ve tried asking the Apple App Store to kind of allow that sort of an ecosystem and it doesn’t happen, you know?",
			"And I think Facebook has tried to build it all into one, and <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:then they’ve kind of just splintered off and it hasn’t worked;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://qz.com/one-meta-feature-is-cannibalizing-its-facebook-feed-and-1850381645\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">then they’ve kind of just splintered off and it hasn’t worked</a>. So they put payments in Facebook Messenger and also in WhatsApp. And the demographics that you’re dealing with with these apps are also very different. So it’s not for lack of trying, I just don’t think they’ve been successful.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> So Meta owns Facebook. It owns Instagram, which it bought. It owns WhatsApp, which it bought, and then it spun off Messenger, which was originally part of Facebook into a separate app. So it has these big four apps, but it keeps them increasingly separate. Why is it doing that?",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> Yeah. I have a feeling that it’s not their choice entirely. It might just be regulation consolidation is harder in the US. There’s an app in South Korea called Kakao, which is essentially another superapp, and they have 187 affiliates to help you do different things. And there is criticism in that country now about how they’ve grown so big and they are kind of getting unstable. They’re not able to handle it. That was a network outage that was huge, you know, late last year. So I suspect that technical aspect might also be a kind of behind the scenes issue for even a Meta or a Facebook, you know, to handle all of that. It’s not just about wanting to do it, it’s also about being able to do it.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> But there are a lot of things that you can do within Facebook. There’s Facebook Marketplace where you can buy and sell goods. There’s still social media, there’s payments, there’s Stories, there’s calendars, birthdays, lots of different things. But I guess it pales in comparison to something like WeChat, where you can literally live your entire life on that app.",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> Correct. And I think you can do without Facebook as well. Like I don’t remember the last time I logged on. I do use WhatsApp and Instagram, but I don’t know when I used my Facebook profile. You know when you have a superapp, you really mean that in every sense. Like it has to have everything. I think there are apps that will try to do some of the things ,and then you can call them like, “complementary apps,” like, “adjacent services apps.”",
			"So if an Uber kind of gives you a ride, it also gives you food, right? So they’re trying, but I see the future of superapps kind of being more just industry-specific. So maybe you have, like, you know, a car owner’s app or you can sell your car, service your car, rent your car out for drivers, or whatever.",
			"But it’ll just be, you know, limited to that if anything were to come up in America, or, like you have a parenting app so you can book a nanny, you can buy diapers, do whatever, you know, but you won’t have the diapers and the kind of, uh, car selling in the same app.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> I think Facebook should get into diapers.",
			"<strong>Ananya: </strong>It’s a big market.",
			"<strong>Scott: </strong>That’s the next big market, yeah. So a lot of this talk has fizzled down, but last year Facebook changed its same to Meta. <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:They promised to bring the metaverse online;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://qz.com/2081426/facebooks-meta-company-wants-control-of-the-metaverse\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">They promised to bring the metaverse online</a>, which was a virtual reality, immersive internet. That was something new. And we’re not talking as much about it these days because there hasn’t been a ton of progress on it or consumer adoption of Meta’s VR devices, but how much do you think that was in response to Apple’s choke hold on the app marketplaces and Facebook’s inability to do anything about that.",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> Yeah, I think it’s interesting you bring up the metaverse because it’s not like Meta was the only one working on it, but, like, we were talking about having different revenue streams. So if you get, like, <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:NFTs;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://qz.com/1997984/what-is-an-nft-the-complete-guide\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NFTs</a> and now I’m buying shoes in the metaverse, and I’m doing other things that don’t require the oversight of an Apple, it opens up a revenue stream for sure, but I think metaverse is also an easier conversation to kill because it is so technology driven. And when you see, you know, <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:avatars with no legs;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://qz.com/why-can-t-we-have-legs-in-the-metaverse-1849344172\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">avatars with no legs</a> or you see things glitching, maybe it’s easier to say, “OK, we’re not ready for this.”",
			"But a superapp is so vague to some extent that you can still believe that everyone’s building it, right? You won’t actually end up stifling that conversation just because we think that Apple does have some dominance right now, you just think someone will circumvent it.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> And the public and regulatory scrutiny is so tight around Silicon Valley right now that…",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> Right.",
			"<strong>Scott: </strong>… it feels like the only place that they can go is just some brand new market that no one’s in.",
			"<strong>Ananya: </strong>Right.",
			"<strong>Scott: </strong>And maybe own an app store and dominate it in the Metaverse.",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> Yeah, that’s farfetched. But good luck?",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> What do you mean that Apple won’t allow Facebook to make a super app?",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> So Apple’s store’s guidelines specifically don’t allow a couple of things. One of them is creating an interface that’ll work as kind of a second home stream, which is what WeChat is to people in China.",
			"And the other one is to not allow in-app payments that are not with Apple’s cut, right? So the moment you make a superapp where the appmaker is kind of controlling all of these things, it already violates the guidelines, and Apple just won’t allow it.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> Is there an argument that Amazon is a superapp?",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> I think it started off trying to be one, if I’m not wrong, their tagline also said something about selling everything. But I think it’s very limited to commerce and content. Right? I think we don’t see Amazon kind of veering into, say, chatting and the fact that it was kind of coined for WeChat makes WeChat the benchmark.",
			"So if you’re not offering almost as much as WeChat is, then you’re not there. Sorry, Amazon.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Amazon does own Twitch;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://qz.com/1989190/amazons-twitch-is-an-unbreakable-monopoly-in-video-game-streaming\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon does own Twitch</a> though.",
			"<strong>Ananya: </strong>That is true.",
			"<strong>Scott: </strong>So maybe there’s a future in which we’re just watching everything on livestream and buying stuff that way, and…",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> And then next time Jeff Bezos can probably sell us a seat on a spaceship on Amazon as well. That’s some kind of ride hailing.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> Yeah. What’s going to be the superapp of space? That’s the real question, which brings me naturally to Elon Musk.",
			"<strong>Ananya: </strong>Yes.",
			"<strong>Scott: </strong>For better or worse, we have to talk about Elon Musk. Elon Musk is probably the most recent of a long line of people in the United States to kind of promise a superapp to American consumers. <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:What happened with Musk and his promises to turn Twitter into a superapp;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://qz.com/elon-musk-will-be-miserable-in-the-app-economy-1849628772\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">What happened with Musk and his promises to turn Twitter into a superapp</a>.",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> Well, I think firstly, he lost a lot of money and then he got a lot of it back, and we got distracted by him being the world’s richest man and then not being one and then being one…but also Musk says a lot of things that don’t happen. Like, <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:he was supposed to bring Tesla to India;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://qz.com/india/2163650/has-tesla-changed-its-plan-to-start-selling-in-india\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">he was supposed to bring Tesla to India</a>, I guess, like, five, six years ago now, and I don’t even think that’s happening at all anymore. And I think the superapp thing is a little more nuanced. <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:He wanted to make this app called X for everything;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://qz.com/elon-musk-is-rebranding-twitter-as-x-corp-1850324904\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">He wanted to make this app called X for everything</a>. He said he bought Twitter so he could sort of build it ground up from there.",
			"Which you know, in theory makes sense cuz if we chat started from QQ, that was a social networking chatting app. Like, why can’t you do it from Twitter? But I think you can’t do it from Twitter, because if you see it in his handling of how he’s kind of taken over Twitter, you know, he brought over some people from Tesla to work on the engineering side. He fired a bunch of people, and the vision is kind of just not there. So he had the intention, but he’s still kind of struggling to make Twitter, Twitter. So I don’t know how he’s going to make it the Everything App.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> Yeah. He seems to be taking the opposite approach. He’s taking every single part of Twitter and trying to change or monetize it, as opposed to bringing more things and more features and more third party companies into the fold and making some money off of that.",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> Yeah, because I think he’s realized what Mark Zuckerberg realized with his companies and he was like, “Let me just keep it separate, and maybe that works out better.” And I also think some of Musk’s stock does act as a deterrent. If he is working on a superapp and he has this vision, it’s a big deal, right? You need a big company to kind of come in and do it, or you need someone with, like, deep pockets to build something like this.",
			"It was the same in China, like, a decade ago as well. So if Musk kind of takes charge of that conversation, he can shape it. So whether or not it happens is different, but if it happens, will he play a big part in it? Probably. If",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> So if you wanted to build a superapp, why buy Twitter first? Because it seems like it’d be easier to just make one from scratch.",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> I actually do think so as well. I do think that retrofitting Twitter into a superapp or like morphing it into something else is just…it makes no sense to me. And also it’s Twitter. It’s not like he bought WhatsApp, right? Or like something that was as ubiquitous. Because Twitter doesn’t have that big a reach.",
			"It is a very specific type of person who uses Twitter, if we place it in the global context. So yeah, I don’t know what he was thinking.",
			"<strong>Scott: </strong>I don’t think he was thinking.",
			"Ananya: That’s true.",
			"<strong>Scott: </strong>It’s a signal of ambition",
			"<strong>Ananya: </strong>Right.",
			"<strong>Scott: </strong>And it’s a lot easier to be ambitious about going to space or creating electric, autonomous vehicles…",
			"<strong>Ananya: </strong>Mm-hmm.",
			"<strong>Scott: </strong>….than Twitter.",
			"<strong>Ananya: </strong>Correct.",
			"<strong>Scott: </strong>It’s funny because the prospect of an American company making an Everything App is limited by the fact that most big tech companies can’t just buy their way into it. There is enough antitrust scrutiny that Facebook, for the most part, has to be done buying huge companies.",
			"Any one that it does is going to get antitrust scrutiny, not only from US regulators, but also from abroad.",
			"<strong>Ananya: </strong>Mm-hmm.",
			"<strong>Scott: </strong>The <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:UK blocked its deal to buy Giphy!;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://qz.com/meta-forced-to-sell-giphy-1849671533\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">UK blocked its deal to buy Giphy!</a>",
			"<strong>Ananya: </strong>Yeah.",
			"<strong>Scott: </strong>There’s not a lot of wiggle room, so any American company that wants to make a superapp has to make it themselves essentially.",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> Yeah. And then what’s your incentive, right? Because at the end of the day, if everyone, like, the point of business is to make money, and then if you’re competing, even if you make a superapp, but you’re ending up competing with Instagram or Facebook and not getting the kind of advertisers and things, then what’s the payoff? You know?",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> Right. <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:How important is antitrust regulation;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://qz.com/2020152/congresss-antitrust-bills-empower-regulators-to-take-on-big-tech\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">How important is antitrust regulation</a> to this conversation? Is that really the reason that we haven’t gotten a superapp outside of China and the reason that we won’t have one in the future?",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> Yeah, I think it is part of the problem because WeChat was “right time, right place, right people.” So you had obviously the regulation. Even in China today is a little bit, you know, the scrutiny is a little bit higher than it used to be.",
			"The government did help at the time. They did even use the platform, and they didn’t kind of get in the way and create roadblocks, which is a blessing in itself, right, for WeChat. Whereas today when you see the way the FTC functions and the way you know, just the regulatory oversight in the US is, even if it’s something like, you know, <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Microsoft buying Activision, a big tech company buying a gaming company;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://qz.com/uk-antitrust-microsoft-activision-deal-blocked-1850377235\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft buying Activision, a big tech company buying a gaming company</a>, it’s not really a vertical integration.",
			"You wouldn’t think it’s such a big deal, but it is, right? So now when you come down to locking people into an ecosystem in, say, Facebook’s, that will have a huge repercussion, right? So I think it is a big part of the conversation today, even in China and more so in the US.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> Why do you think tech entrepreneurs are still, to this day, promising to build a superapp? Even if it just seems completely unlikely that the consumer behavior isn’t there and the antitrust scrutiny is just too high.",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> I have a one-word answer and that answer is “money,” because it’s the fact that you are getting everyone to do everything in one place. So if you can figure it out, then you <em>can</em> have the multiple advertising streams within that one app. You <em>can</em> take a cut from different services all in one app versus doing it just in one. So the promise is big. I just don’t know if there’s a way to actually make it happen, but if it does happen, it’s definitely going to be bigger than any single app that exists today.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> Do you think anyone in the US actually <em>wants</em> a superapp?",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> So there was a survey that PayPal did where they surveyed, I think, over 9,000 people in Australia, Germany, the UK, the US… and overwhelmingly most people were <em>slightly</em> interested in a superapp. About a quarter of them were “very” or “extremely” interested. So if we’re going to take that as a benchmark, then people sort of kind of want a superapp?",
			"<strong>Scott: </strong>Yeah.",
			"<strong>Ananya: </strong>I think they also don’t know why they would need one, you know? Because at the end of the day, the superapp is not bringing something new. It’s just consolidating things.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> It’s also the posturing that you want to build a superapp the point. Is that just good marketing and a good way to boost a stock price?",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> I think it shows some kind of sense of security, right? You’re kind of saying that I’ve achieved all that I can achieve and now I want to do the next big thing. It’s that confidence that you inspire.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> So why does it matter that China has a superapp and the rest of the world really doesn’t, because ultimately what you’re doing is either opening your phone and seeing a bevy of services or opening your phone and then opening an app and seeing a bevy of services.",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> So I actually think the superapp conversation should be more concentrated, not in the sort of Western or developed economies. South Asian markets, <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:or even India for that matter.;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://qz.com/india/1765349/why-paytm-ola-flipkart-jio-shouldnt-try-to-be-wechat-of-india\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">or even India for that matter.</a> Those are the markets where it still matters, because you still have underpowered smartphones, you still have people who are, like, unbanked, whose primary habit is not to swipe their card, you know?",
			"So I think having a conversation about “Why do we need a superapp in the US?”—that’s more about ambition and about, you know, who’s going to take control and if people are going to take to it. But in other parts of the world, I think the conversation is about “How do we get the most out of this phone for the least amount of money?” Still.",
			"<strong>Scott:</strong> If Apple and <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Google’s monopoly power;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://qz.com/59326/98-of-chinese-smart-phones-run-googles-android-and-the-government-doesnt-like-that\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google’s monopoly power</a> is eroded, do you think that could pave the way for a superapp in the United States or elsewhere?",
			"<strong>Ananya:</strong> In theory, yes. And especially at the beginning, like I think when you’re just getting used to them, maybe, you know, if they get rid of the 30% fee or if like, “OK, you can now, you know, use plugins or you can now accept payments within the app without informing us,” it will start that. But eventually, I think if it ran rampant and if, you know, there were issues, if consumers started complaining that someone’s fleeing them or something’s not working… maybe those safeguards kind of come back, or maybe other people start regulating it. So I don’t think we can say blanketly that yes, it will happen. I think it’ll also wreak a lot of havoc before it’s figured out.",

			"LinkedIn also said it was eliminating the slimmed down jobs app that it offers in China after it decided in 2021 to mostly withdraw from the country, citing a \"challenging\" environment. The remaining China app, called InCareers, will be phased out by Aug. 9, LinkedIn said.",

			"In May 2019, Uber finally went public almost a decade after billionaires, Wall Street funds and tech moguls had gotten the first bite of the apple.

The analysis anticipates the market to add more than $20 billion to the valuation by the end of this year. The 2022 performance is impressive, considering the global data center revenue was sub-$200 billion just two years ago.",
			"According to a research by Allied Market Research, the data center market was worth $187.35 billion in 2020 and was expected to clock $517.17 billion by 2030. Interestingly, Statista's analysis reaches a valuation close to Allied Market Research's, positing that the global data centers market will generate approximately $410.40 billion in revenue by 2027. However, the former's CAGR is significantly smaller, at 4.66%, compared to Allied Market Research's 10.50%. The CAGR mismatch notwithstanding, there appears to be strong agreement that the data centers market has immense potential to break past the half trillion USD mark before the decade's end.",
			"The CAGRs that several analyses are quoting at which the data center services market will grow in a particular forecast period are incredible. For example, Allied Market Research quotes 10.50% between 2021 and 2030, while <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Mordor Intelligence's;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/service-market-for-data-center\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mordor Intelligence's</a> figure is 13.69% between 2021 and 2026. In this light, a question arises: How will the market achieve an astronomical growth rate? In other words, what factors will drive the growth incredible growth?",
			"For Mordor Intelligence, the growing demand for cloud services will carry much weight. The claim is perhaps in response to a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Markets and Markets;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/cloud-computing-market-234.html#:~:text=The%20global%20cloud%20computing%20market,17.9%25%20from%202022%20to%202027.\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Markets and Markets</a> report, which established that the cloud computing market will expand at a 17% CAGR between 2022 and 2027, reaching $1,240.90 billion. Since data centers provide the critical infrastructure that keeps the cloud computing market running, any expansion that cloud computing posts naturally reaches data center services companies.",
			"Besides cloud computing, increasing demand for e-commerce services will also spur growth in the data center services market.

The organization makes a bolder claim that the market should be worth $6.35 trillion by 2027, thanks to an 11.51% CAGR. With the expansion of the e-commerce space comes the possibility of the data center services market's growth potential blowing up. This is because e-commerce customers want more personalized data and better recommendations for what products to buy, which is made possible by services undergirded by data centers.",
			"As the growth potential of the data center services market expands, the companies involved in this space have more room to grow revenues. Consequently, with stronger financials comes an increased likelihood for the stocks to climb higher.

			"The Cupertino, California-based company sold bonds in a five-part, $5.25 billion deal which was originally targeted at about $5 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter. The longest portion, a 30-year bond, will yield 108 basis points over comparable Treasuries, less than the roughly 135 basis points initially discussed, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.",
			"Dealers surveyed by Bloomberg are expecting $30 billion to $35 billion of US high-grade bond sales this week as corporate debt markets show signs of stabilizing. A total of 11 companies are set to issue $22.55 billion of fresh debt on Monday, locking in funding before the release of the consumer price index on Wednesday, followed by the producer price index Thursday. T-Mobile US Inc. and Merck &amp; Co. Inc. also brought $3.5 billion and $6 billion in bonds, respectively.",
			"Proceeds from Apple’s sale will be used for general corporate purposes.

The sale was the first for Apple since it sold $5.5 billion to fund buybacks and dividends in August.",
			"Apple’s decision to issue billions in new debt is “due more to its confidence in expanding cash flow than operational needs,” Robert Schiffman, senior credit analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a note. The five-tranche bond issuance should further benefit the company’s net-cash-neutral goal, he said.",
			"The deal is “going to be very well received by the market,” Rob Waldner, chief fixed income strategist and head of macro research at Invesco, said on Bloomberg TV before the deal priced. “We have seen quite a lot of demand for high quality fixed income.”",

For more top stocks, head on over to <strong><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Goldman Sachs' Top 5 Stock Picks for 2023;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/goldman-sachs-top-5-stock-picks-for-2023-1117268/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Goldman Sachs' Top 5 Stock Picks for 2023</a>. </strong>",
			"After a vicious drubbing in 2022 that led to growth and technology stocks sometimes bleeding as much as half of their value on the stock market, 2023 appears to be off to a good start. Companies such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:META;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/meta%20platforms%20inc/1326801/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">META</a>) are up by a whopping 94% year to date, giving some hope that perhaps, for the technology industry, the worst might be over.",
			"This sentiment is also encouraged by statements from the Federal Reserve. The Fed's extremely hawkish actions last year aimed at bringing down inflation saw it increase U.S. benchmark interest rates by a massive 5 percentage points, bringing it up from the 0.25% rate that had been set during the onset of the coronavirus pandemic when the bank had cut rates by 2.5% in March 2020. At the same time, the Fed's latest meeting which saw it increase rates by 25 basis points (0.25%) came with optimistic commentary from both the monetary policy committee and chairman Jerome Powell.",
			"Investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:GS;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/goldman%20sachs%20group%20inc/886982/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GS</a>), on the other hand, is taking a look at the impact of the Fed rate hikes on the general economic health. The bank's outlook for 2023 is cautiously upbeat as well if we go by its <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Economic Outlook Report;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/gs-research/2023-us-economic-outlook-approaching-a-soft-landing/report.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Economic Outlook Report</a>. Goldman believes that it is possible to reduce inflation without pushing the economy into a recession, and subsequently, it has diverged from the consensus view which is certain that a recession is on the horizon. Au contraire, the investment bank outlines that if the GDP growth is carefully managed - by keeping growth close to 1% for reducing labor demand to bringing down wages for diminishing purchasing power - then a recession, typically defined as consecutive quarters of reduced economic growth, can be avoided.",

Ukraine is known as the \"breadbasket of Europe,\" so the distinct properties of the region will provide a valuable dataset to help improve the tool.",
			"Through this partnership, the tool will also be given a new use case: to guide recovery and resource management amid the war in Ukraine. With information and farming resources difficult to access, the researchers are working on developing a flood and drought assessment system to identify the most affected regions that need the most resources and support.",
			"<strong>There is power in partnerships</strong>",
			"By uniting experts and technology with the purpose of improving the lives of populations most affected by environmental threats, we have the potential to make lasting, scalable impact on populations in need. IBM's technology and expertise, combined with the background and resources of Texas A&amp;M AgriLife, has increased Liquid Prep's potential to help people around the world.",

			"Side hustles are, by nature, outside of your regular job. Whether it’s driving for Uber or building a business, you can’t do this on the clock. So you need to take inventory of your current schedule to see how much time you can realistically dedicate to side gigs.",
			"Once you’ve figured out how much time you can spend per day, per week or per month on a side hustle then you can begin to evaluate different side hustles. Make sure whatever side gig you choose can fit within your schedule. If it takes a ton of time and doesn’t earn the money you want, it’s automatically a “no.”",
			"And while things that don’t pay right away (building a business, creating printables, etc.) can take some time, remember that if you build it properly, you spend less and less time on it down the road.",

			"Everyone’s an expert in something. Whether it’s fantasy sports, crocheting or simply staying organized, you have skills that you can use.",
			"When picking a side gig, it’s important to find something that plays to your strengths. If you are constantly struggling to do the work, you won’t stick with it for very long.",
			"For example, if you love chatting and driving, Uber might be a great gig. If you hate socializing, but don’t mind the driving part, how about Uber Eats or DoorDash?",
			"And if you want to use what you know to start a side business, you can quickly build one online. Creating a Shopify store or Etsy store is an easy way to quickly list things for sale, whether it’s a physical or digital product.",
			"The key is to leverage your expertise to do something that you enjoy and make money at the same time.",
			"There are hundreds of ways to make money on the side, but not all of them pay enough to make it worth it. It’s important to evaluate how much money you can make from a side hustle before diving in.",
			"As an example, online surveys are easy and you can do them from your phone, but you might spend hours per week and earn less than $100 per month. On the flip side, driving for Uber can earn you up to $20 per hour (or more) and has an income potential of $1,000 or more per month, even with just 12 hours per week.",
			"The best way to calculate the income potential is to figure out how much you can earn per hour of time spent, and then multiply that by the time you have available. If you have five hours per week and can make $25 per hour, you can earn $125 per week, or $600 per month on average.",
			"And if you’re building a business, you may be able to increase your earnings while spending less time on the business, but it usually takes an initial time investment to get things up and running.",
			"Some side gigs require some upfront costs, while others you can simply just right in and start earning money. If you don’t want to sink your savings into a side hustle, you will want to rule out anything that has expenses before you earn money.",
			"If you want to become a photographer on the side, but don’t have a quality camera, you will need to purchase one to get paying clients. If you already own a camera, great, but if not, you need to account for that expense.",
			"But if you join DoorDash, for example, you only need a mode of transportation (even just a bicycle) and to download the app.",
			"And if you’re building a business, you might need to pay for software or materials to begin creating a product, so always account for those costs when calculating your potential profit.",
			"Once you’ve found some side gigs that are worth your time and can make decent money, you should pick one that you actually enjoy. While the money may be nice at first, if you absolutely hate doing a job, you won’t stick with it for very long.",
			"This goes back to understanding your expertise and what you truly enjoy and playing to those strengths. If you find a side gig that you like doing, it won’t feel as much like work, and you can continue earning money on the side for a long time to come.",
			"While it seems like there’s an endless amount of side jobs to choose from, picking the wrong one can waste your time (and your money), leaving you feeling defeated. It’s important to evaluate your side hustle before jumping in to make sure it aligns with your financial goals and can fit into your schedule without stressing you out. Once you find the perfect side hustle, you can unlock some more financial freedom in your life doing something you actually enjoy!",

			"May 8 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes struggled for direction on Monday amid disappointing earnings from Tyson Foods and Catalent, a weak rebound in regional banks, and a shift in focus to a key inflation reading later this week.",
			"Shares of Catalent Inc tumbled 25.5% as the contract drug manufacturer saw lower revenue and core profit in 2023, while Tyson Foods dropped 15.9% on a surprise second-quarter loss and a cut in its annual revenue forecast.",
			"A rebound in regional lenders ran out of steam by midday trading, with the KBW Regional Banking index falling 1.86% after posting its best single-day performance in seven weeks on Friday.",
			"The struggle for a clearer direction comes after a rally on Friday, when U.S. jobs data pointed to a resilient labor market.",
			"\"Whenever you have a big up day, people need more good news to keep the market up every day in a row,\" said portfolio manager Moez Kassam of Anson Funds.",
			"Also weighing on the main indexes was a 1.1% decline in shares of Microsoft Corp, while Apple Inc was flat after rising 4.7% on Friday when it posted upbeat results.",
			"The spotlight this week, however, will be on the Labor Department's inflation reading on Wednesday, which is expected to show the consumer price index (CPI) likely climbed 0.4% in April after gaining 0.1% in March. Producer prices, weekly jobless claims and consumer sentiment data are all lined up for the week.",
			"Data points this week will help investors not only gauge whether the Federal Reserve's aggressive tightening cycle - including its most recent 25 basis point hike last week - is working towards tamping down inflation but also if fears of stagflation are founded.",
			"\"The bigger picture is inflation will remain higher for longer and that we are heading into a recession,\" Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities.",
			"\"Whether that's hard or soft remains to be seen, but until there's something to disprove that bigger picture thesis, the overall market is going to remain somewhat range bound.\"",
			"The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 68.99 points, or 0.2%, to 33,605.39, the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.93 points, or 0.02%, to 4,137.18 and the Nasdaq Composite added 10.28 points, or 0.08%, to 12,245.69.",
			"A rally in regional banks' shares proved short-lived, with PacWest Bancorp rising 5.6% after gaining as much as about 30% earlier in the session after the lender sharply cut its quarterly dividend to boost capital.",
			"Shares of regional banks tumbled for much of last week on worries tied to the collapse of First Republic Bank.",
			"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc's Class B shares rose 0.9% after posting a $35.5 billion first-quarter profit, boosted by gains from stocks such as Apple.",
			"American Airlines Group Inc rose 3.1% after J.P. Morgan raised its rating to \"overweight\" from \"neutral\".",
			"Shares of Zscaler Inc rose 3.5% after the cloud security company raised its annual forecast.",
			"Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.13-to-1 ratio favored decliners.",
			"The S&amp;P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and seven new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 54 new highs and 73 new lows.",

			"<span><strong>Monday, May 8, 2023</strong><br/><br/>The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Mastercard Incorporated (MA), The Coca-Cola Company (KO) and T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.<br/><br/>You can <strong>see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong><br/><br/><strong>Mastercard</strong> shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+18.0% vs. +10.2%). Company’s numerous acquisitions are helping it to grow addressable markets and drive new revenue streams. We expect the company's top line at $25.2 billion in 2023. The COVID-19 crisis accelerated the adoption of digital and contactless solutions, providing an opportunity for MA's business to expedite its shift to the digital mode.<br/><br/>Mastercard is well-poised to gain from steady cash-generating abilities. A strong capital position allows it to pursue acquisitions and prudently deploy capital.<br/><br/>However, steep operating expenses might stress margins. High rebates and incentives may weigh on the company's net revenues. Its dividend yield is still lower than the industry average. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.<br/><br/>(You can <strong>read the full research report on Mastercard here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br/><br/>Shares of <strong>Coca-Cola</strong> have gained +1.4% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry’s gain of +10.3%. The company’s earnings and sales improved year over year and surpassed the Zacks analyst estimates in the quarter. KO’s results benefited from the continued momentum in its business.<br/><br/>Sales gained from revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and a rise in concentrate sales. It is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments. It provided an upbeat guidance for 2023.<br/><br/>However, shares of Coca-Cola lagged the industry in the past three months. Pressures from higher supply chain costs, higher marketing spends and currency headwinds are concerning.<br/><br/>(You can <strong>read the full research report on Coca-Cola here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br/><br/>Shares of <strong>T-Mobile US</strong> have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+18.0% vs. -4.8%). With industry-leading growth in postpaid and broadband customers driven by superior 5G network and focus on customers, T-Mobile reported solid first-quarter 2023 results driven by diligent execution of operational plans.<br/><br/>The company has augmented its 5G footprint by introducing 5G Home Internet services in several states. T-Mobile plans to reach 300 million people within 2023. It intends to bring more competition to home broadband, especially in underserved rural markets.<br/><br/>However, T-Mobile operates in a fiercely competitive and almost saturated U.S. telecom market, which lowers its growth potential to some extent. Several promotional activities to lure additional customers are further eroding profitability. Lower equipment revenues due to a challenging macroeconomic environment remain a concern. Debt obligation woes also persist.<br/><br/>(You can <strong>read the full research report on T-Mobile US here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br/><br/>Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Shopify Inc. (SHOP), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC) and EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG).<br/><br/>Director of Research<br/><br/>Sheraz Mian<br/><br/><em>Note: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings. He is frequently quoted in the print and electronic media and publishes the weekly <strong>Earnings Trends</strong> and <strong>Earnings Preview</strong> reports.

			"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Estonian ride-hailing and food delivery startup Bolt expects to turn profitable in the next 12 months and be ready for an initial public offering in 2025, its Chief Executive Officer Markus Villig said in an interview.",
			"The company, a rival of Uber, was valued at over $8 billion when it raised 628 million euros from investors in January last year.",
			"\"We expect to be the first European mobility platform that will be fully profitable over the next 12 months,\" said Villig, who doesn't have a driving license.",
			"Uber is also expecting to post operating income profitability this year.",
			"Bolt, run by 29-year-old Villig, does not plan to raise external capital through another funding round but will get ready for an IPO instead.",
			"\"We are planning to be ready to go public in 2025,\" he said, adding that a final decision will depend on market conditions at that time.",
			"The startup, which also offers electric scooter rentals, car-sharing and grocery delivery service, has a focus on Africa from where it gets 50 million of its 150 million customers.",
			"\"Out of all the African countries, we've so far only launched in seven... over the next 10 years Africa remains a massive opportunity for us,\" Villig said.",
			"Bolt is also evaluating whether it could fix the payment landscape in Africa where many people are more likely to have a mobile phone than a bank account.",
			"\"Maybe we should go into that one day,\" he said.",
			"The company has not publicly disclosed its revenue but Villig said the company is doing single-digit billions of dollars of transactions on the platform every year.",
			"It also expects its grocery business to break even or turn profitable in two or three years.",
			"Grocery delivery is a highly competitive area as companies like Bolt, Just Eat Takeaway.com and Uber Eats are charging more for delivery to cover the costs of higher wages as some countries crack down on the gig industry.",
			"The food delivery sector was among those boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic, but the effect has waned as consumers, faced with surging prices, have cut discretionary spending.",
			"Ride-hailing is Bolt's largest business. It charges a commission of between 20% to 23% of the fare which can go as low as 10% if drivers choose to opt for promotions such as putting a Bolt sticker on their cars.",
			"\"Our philosophy is not always to be the cheapest rider ... the mistake that some platforms make is that if you only focus on the lowest prices, you can end up with very bad availability of cars because drivers will not be happy,\" Villig said.",

			"Revenue rose 14%to $1 billion, topping $981 million that Refinitiv expected, but Lyft’s operations still resulted in anet loss of $187.6 million, or 50 cents a share. With the first reported quarter since getting behind the CEO wheel, David Risher is more than pleased with the results that show improvement in rideshare services with riders taking more rides and drivers gaining the power to increase their earnings.",
			"Over the past year, Lyft lost 50% of its value.  When Risher who is a former retail executive at Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:AMZN;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AMZN\">AMZN</a>) took charge last month as co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer decided to step back from daily roles, Lyft embarked on a journey of serious job and cost cuts in an effort to compete with Uber. Back in April, Risher announced that 1,072 employees will be let go, which represent about 26% of Lyft’s workforce. Second-quarter earnings are expected in the range $1.0 billion to $1.02 billion, disappointing analysts who were expecting$1.08 billion, according to Refinitiv.",
			"Unlike Lyft, Uber is all into diversification as besides ride-hailing, its business spans across food delivery, transportation, logistics and product delivery business. Besides its business being solely ridesharing, Lyft is also only present in North America, while Uber is in 70 countries around the globe. Given Uber’s global scale, it is pretty much impossible for Lyft to win the ride-sharing game, especially given the financially tight macroeconomic environment.",
			"Uber began the year strong by showing growth while improving its profitability.",
			"Revenue for the quarter rose 29% YoY to $8.82 billion, topping $8.72 billion that Refinitiv expected. Mobility segment generated $4.33 billion in revenue while delivery brought in $3.09 billion.  What was down from 2022’s quarter was the freight business that generated $1.4 billion, down from $1.8 billion as consumers have been spending more on services and less on retail that is shipped by freight.",
			"Gross bookings rose 19% YoY to $31.4 billion, with mobility rising 40% YoY to $14.98 billion and deliveries rising <strong>8% YoY to</strong><strong> </strong>$15.02 billion.",
			"Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $761 million, topping StreetAccount’s consensus estimate of $687 million.",
			"Uber made a net loss of $157 million, or 8 cents per share, improving from $5.9 billion, or $3.03 per share it lost during last year’s comparable quarter.",
			"Operating loss was $262 million, representing a margin of negative 3% which is an improvement compared to negative 6% over the last 12 months.",
			"Uber is already using AI achieve accurate predictions of arrival times for rides and deliveries as well as to handle driver recruitment more “reliably and cost-efficiently.” CEO Dara Khosrowshahi remarked that the tech company is only the early stages of using large data models to improve user experiences and efficiencies across its business, announcing significant developments are on the horizon.",
			"This segment was Uber’s brightest spot during the COVID-19 lockdowns, and one in which it competes with DoorDash (NYSE: <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:DASH;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=DASH\">DASH</a>) that also reported a strong quarter as consumers continued using online deliveries despite higher prices. DoorDash reported its revenue grew almost 40% to $2.4 billion as orders increased 27% YoY. Along with record revenue and orders, DoorDash also raised its guidance on the back of strong demand. But despite Adjusted EBITDA of $204 million, rising from 2022 quarter’s $54 million, DoorDash still made a GAAP loss of 41 cents per share, improving from 2022’s quarter loss of 48 cents per share.",
			"It's safe to say that there is no competition between Uber and Lyft as the latter looking for way to stay above water, while the former is defying the tech slump by getting its house, one that hosts a diversified business model, in order.",
			"But despite winning big in ride-hailing and improving on the profitability front, Uber still has a negative operating margin meaning its costs over the past 12 months exceeded the gross profit of $12 billion it made over that timeframe. Moreover, food delivery remains a notoriously low-margin business. Even with $15 billion in bookings just this quarter, Uber's food delivery segment only brought in $288 million in adjusted EBITDA which excludes corporate expenses and non-cash charges. Therefore, defeating Lyft or any other competitor is not all it takes to win in business.",

			"Every year on April 26, <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:World Intellectual Property Day;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://pr.report/TVUXhW7C\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">World Intellectual Property Day</a> reminds us of the importance of inventing - and the diverse community of creators who drive breakthrough innovations. It's certainly a day to celebrate, as nothing conveys optimism like the act of creating something new. But innovation cannot occur in a vacuum. To flourish, it requires two things: a continually replenished pool of innovators and a robust legal system to protect their inventions. Here at Qualcomm, we know that the protection of intellectual property (IP) through a strong patent system lies at the heart of our success. At the same time, we are striving to grow and diversify the universe of patent holders to include historically underrepresented groups - including women.",
			"By protecting and rewarding innovation, IP laws shape our lives for the better. Patent licensing plays a key role in spurring innovation, giving inventors of all backgrounds the incentive they need to create, finance their research, and make their ideas commercially viable. At Qualcomm, our philosophy is to continually innovate and create a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:foundation;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://pr.report/NYzviqSo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">foundation</a> upon which others can build and succeed. Licensing our IP is an integral part of this approach. It democratizes innovation, taking cutting-edge inventions and making them accessible to a broad range of players across industries.",
			"That said, it's equally imperative that the population of inventors continually grows. Recognition of this is implicit in the theme of World IP Day 2023, \"Women and IP: Accelerating innovation and creativity.\" <i>Everyone </i>should have the opportunity to invent and patent their ideas. Not only do more diverse inventor communities result in more varied problem-solving but breaking down barriers creates more - and better - innovation. It results in more jobs, boosts the global economy, closes wage and wealth gaps, and yields new ways to improve society.",

In addition to women, these groups include people of color, LGBTQIA+, people from lower-income communities, and people with disabilities.",
			"True innovation depends on diversity. World-class research and development (R&amp;D) teams who have a broad wealth of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives play a critical role in ensuring that our - and everyone's - products live up to their potential. We encourage and celebrate innovation across all backgrounds, from school-aged children who participate in our <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Thinkabit Lab;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://pr.report/MGaDsLi2\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Thinkabit Lab</a> programs across the country, to our engineers who receive <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:special recognition;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://pr.report/MZ2kR3jc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">special recognition</a> for patenting their inventions, to participants in our Female Founders Summit start-up competition.",
			"For centuries, the American patent system has served as a model for strong IP rights. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:intellectual property in the U.S. supports more than 45 million jobs;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://pr.report/yXnSQJN6\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">intellectual property in the U.S. supports more than 45 million jobs</a> and contributes over $6.6 trillion to the nation's economy.

And it will go a long way towards preserving our status as the world's preeminent innovation economy.",

Today, we hold over 140,000 patents and pending applications, and our patent portfolio is the most widely and extensively licensed in the wireless industry, with over 300 companies licensed.",
			"But we cannot do it alone. World IP Day gives us the opportunity to reflect on how patent protections have driven economic growth and job creation in the U.S. and around the world. Countries with strong IP systems have higher levels of foreign investment, more innovation, increased R&amp;D activity, higher percentages of workers employed in good-paying jobs, and greater potential to produce and export complex, knowledge-intensive products. If we keep IP protections strong and ensure that the pool of inventors continues to grow and diversify, we best position society to reap the global benefits of innovation.",

However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Intel's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.",

			"Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Intel Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company.

			"Plastic waste has become a pressing global issue, with millions of tons of plastic waste ending up in our oceans and landfills every year. To tackle this problem, governments around the world are introducing plastic packaging taxes as a policy tool to discourage the production and use of plastic packaging, especially ones made of virgin plastic.",
			"If you are using or producing plastic packaging, it is important to know whether your company is affected by the legislation and how SAP can help.",
			"<strong>What Are Plastic Packaging Taxes?</strong>",
			"Plastic packaging taxes are taxes that are imposed on companies that produce or import plastic packaging. The aim of plastic packaging taxes is to encourage companies to reduce their use of plastic packaging and increase the use of more sustainable alternatives. Two countries, the UK and Spain, have already introduced plastic packaging taxes and others, such as Italy and Germany, have announced their plans to follow.",
			"<strong>Why Are Plastic Packaging Taxes Becoming More Popular?</strong>",
			"In Europe, one reason for the growing popularity of plastic packaging taxes is the introduction of a European Plastic Packaging Levy in 2021. This levy requires member states to pay €0.80 for each kilogram of plastic packaging waste that is not recycled in their country. Many countries are now considering passing on these costs to the industry through national plastic packaging taxes.",
			"Globally, there are also events that indicate that more regulation is to be expected. For example, in March 2022, the United Nations Environment Assembly has agreed to launch negotiations on a legally binding global agreement to combat plastic pollution. For countries to comply with the legally binding provisions and obligations of this UN treaty, they will most likely strengthen their national laws regarding plastics.",
			"<strong>What Makes the Administration of Plastic Packaging Taxes Complicated?</strong>",

			"The more countries introduce plastic packaging taxes, the more difficult it will be for global companies to keep track and be compliant.

			"The SAP solution can provide a number of powerful benefits for companies. By creating a single source of truth for packaging data, SAP Responsible Design and Production helps eliminate repetitive, manual pre-reporting processes, such as data collection and cleansing. Furthermore, it can accurately calculate fees and taxes in line with the latest regulations, helping companies to reduce regulatory exposure. In addition to reporting to regulatory bodies, it can also enable reporting on various levels of granularity to non-governmental organizations, customers, and other brand-related communications.

The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Nvidia belongs, has gained 2.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?",
			"Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.",
			"<b>Earnings Estimate Revisions</b>",
			"Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.",
			"Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.",
			"Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.92 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -32.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.",
			"For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.50 points to a change of +34.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.6%.",
			"For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.98 indicates a change of +32.9% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.",
			"Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nvidia is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).",

			"While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.",

			"Chicago, IL – May 8, 2023 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Meta Platforms, Inc. META and Shopify Inc. SHOP.",
			"<strong>Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:</strong>",
			"The tech sector is up more than 18% this year, more than double the S&amp;P 500's roughly 7%.",
			"But this is a huge sector, with many different kinds of companies offering very different kinds of products and services to often different markets. Therefore, it's difficult to come up with common factors that drive the sector.",
			"Until you look at the market capitalization of some of these companies. Alphabet, for instance, with its market cap of over $1.3 trillion, has a much greater impact on the sector's performance when it rises around 19% year to date than, say, BigBear.ai Holdings, although this stock has soared 285%+. The same can be said of Microsoft, with its market cap of over $2.2 trillion (up nearly 27% year to date), or of Meta Platforms with its $614 billion market cap (up 94%) or Shopify with its $59 billion (up 65%).",
			"The point is that this is a sector with some very large cap stocks that skew the average whenever they make big moves. Since they have been making big moves this year, it makes sense to see why.",
			"The biggest reason perhaps is the stabilization in the interest rate. As inflation rates continue to moderate, the markets have been expecting the Fed to stop raising rates. After the latest hike, the Fed has indicated that there may not be further hikes this year. Rate hikes are a problem for most growth stocks because these are the riskiest assets. Investors put their money into these stocks in the hopes that they'll get outsized returns at some future date.",
			"Technology companies may be younger or mature, but by their very nature, they invest huge capital in futuristic innovations that may or may not generate the anticipated returns. Therefore, when higher rates make less risky assets more attractive, some investors switch to those. Additionally, tech companies may also take a certain amount of debt to fund their R&amp;D. Stabilization in the interest rate therefore makes these stocks more attractive.",
			"Another reason for the big moves is the effect of the pandemic. In the initial phase of the pandemic, the rapid digitization generated huge business for some of these players. This pulled in five years of demand (by some estimates). As a result, demand dropped drastically in the following period, a situation that persists today, in some segments. Given the disappointing outlook, tech stocks plunged last year, making them more attractive from a valuation perspective.",
			"The third reason, and this is specific to the larger cap tech stocks, is that although they invest humongous amounts of cash in their future innovations, they also have certain existing products that are pretty much like cash cows, generating year upon year of solid revenue and cash flows, as in the case of any good quality mature company.",
			"Unlike mature players in certain other sectors, these stocks don't pay dividends. Or, just a handful of them – like Apple – do. They tend to pour the whole thing back into the business and maintain large cash balances for financial flexibility. This makes them attractive in times of uncertain demand, especially the mild recession/soft landing that most analysts are anticipating. ",
			"So, let's take a closer look at some of these big tech stocks:",
			"<strong>Alphabet Inc.</strong>",
			"Search giant Alphabet posted strong numbers last quarter, exceeding revenue estimates by 1.5% and earnings estimates by 10.4%. In the past month, the company's 2023 earnings estimate increased 3.9% while the 2024 estimate increased 2.0%. Revenue and earnings are expected to increase an estimated 6.1% and 18.2% this year and 10.6% and 16.1%, respectively in the next.",
			"<strong>Microsoft Corp.</strong>",
			"A provider of computer software, productivity solutions, search, cloud infrastructure services and more, Microsoft is easily one of the most attractive players right now. In the last quarter, Microsoft's earnings surprise of 10.4% came on top of a revenue surprise of 3.8%. Analyst estimates for the years ending June 2023 and 2024 have increased 2.9% and 2.4%, respectively. Its revenue is expected to increase 6.3% this year and 10.3% in the next. Earnings are expected to increase 4.3% and 12.1%, respectively.",
			"<strong>Meta Platforms, Inc. </strong>",
			"Social media provider Meta posted a sales surprise of 4.2% in the last quarter, which resulted in an earnings surprise of 34.7%. In the last 30 days, its 2023 earnings estimate has increased 12.6% and 2024 estimate 13.2%. Analysts currently expect revenue growth of 8.6% this year and 10.8% in 2024. Earnings are expected to grow 19.6% and 24.3%, respectively.",
			"<strong>Shopify Inc. </strong>",
			"Shopify provides an online commerce platform for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). The company's March quarter earnings surprise of 50% came on top of revenues that surprised by 4.9%. Analysts have merely fine-tuned their estimates on this company's revenue and earnings, which are expected to grow 18.1% and 25%, respectively in 2023 and 21.6% and 395.8%, respectively the following year.",
			"Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) rating on Meta shares and a #2 (Buy) rating on the others.",

Perhaps some traders pigeonhole Mullen as just another EV start-up that's headed for zombie status, but that's an overblown fear as Mullen has a decent-sized cash runway of $116 million and hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of purchase orders. Mullen is busy fulfilling those orders from both the public and private sectors."

			"In a multi-state settlement reached last year, TurboTax owner Intuit Inc. was ordered to pay the money to about 4.4 million people, the AP reported. The affected parties were low-income Americans who were eligible for the IRS Free File program but ended up paying TurboTax for federal returns filed in the 2016, 2017 and 2018 tax years. New York Attorney General Letitia James accused TurboTax of “predatory and deceptive marketing.”",
			"You might be eligible to receive a payment if you were told you didn’t qualify for the free software, paid Intuit to complete your return and didn’t use the company’s own Free File product in a previous year, according to the <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:settlement website;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://agturbotaxsettlement.com/Common-Questions\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">settlement website</a>. Millions of people should receive checks.",
			"Most eligible consumers should receive around $30, CNBC reported, though payments might go as high as $85 if you used TurboTax during all three tax years. Rust Consulting, the settlement fund administrator, will contact you by email if you are eligible for a payment. Checks will be issued throughout May 2023.",
			"James’ investigation focused on how TurboTax “steered customers” into paying for tax prep even though they qualified for the free government program, according to ProPublica, whose 2019 reporting led to the investigation.",
			"“TurboTax’s predatory and deceptive marketing cheated millions of low-income Americans who were trying to fulfill their legal duties to file their taxes,” James said. “Today we are righting that wrong and putting money back into the pockets of hardworking taxpayers who should have never paid to file their taxes.”",
			"Intuit did not admit wrongdoing in the settlement.",
			"The settlement underscores the importance of digging deeper into ad claims to find out if they are legitimate, legal experts say. The fact that it happened in the first place shows how easy it is for companies to mislead customers.",
			"In a February 2023 <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:blog;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.toddflaw.com/blog/3-biggest-false-advertising-scandals/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a>, the Todd Friedman law offices noted that “if false advertising were obvious, it wouldn’t be so successful.”",
			"One common deception is claiming that a product is “clinically proven” to do something. For example, last decade L’Oreal faced fraudulent advertising charges for claiming that its Lancôme Génifique and L’Oréal Paris Youth Code skincare products were “clinically proven” to help customers’ skin look younger even though the company had no scientific evidence to back the claim up, according to the Friedman blog.",
			"Another example was Volkswagen claiming that some of its diesel vehicles had lower levels of pollutants. As the blog noted, the Federal Trade Commission later found that the car company used “illegal emission defeat devices” that aimed to mask high emissions during government tests.",
			"“When you’re considering a product, it’s best not to take the advertising and packaging at its word,” the Friedman blog said.",

			"<strong>Rooted to the Earth</strong>",
			"Growing up in rural Maine, I spent much of my childhood exploring the outdoors with my family - scrambling on rocks and exploring tidal pools on the coast, skiing, hiking, and swimming in the mountains. Being outside with friends and family was an integral part of how I grew up. These experiences instilled in me a true love for our Earth and the people on it, which is why I chose to focus my work on sustainability and climate solutions.",
			"My passion for philanthropy was greatly influenced by my parents, both of whom worked in hospitals mainly helping underserved communities. They were my role models in turning to nonprofit work. I remember a specific moment when I was 12 years old and did \"take your daughter to work day\" with my dad, who was a physician at a hospital for military veterans. I was in awe of how he went above and beyond to help people. While I didn't follow his path into medicine, I chose the nonprofit path, which is in line with the type of work that he did to help people and causes that don't normally get prioritized.",
			"I have focused the majority of my career on sustainable food systems and in recent years the power of <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:food waste;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://pr.report/rRAMkwPW\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">food waste</a> as a climate solution.

Instead of getting depressed, I became inspired and excited for what humans could do with technology. I felt I had to pivot my career to focus on climate solutions in general. With the power of technology and community, we can come together to make a difference and solve the most pressing problem of our time.",

As a member of this network, I am part of a movement of professionals creating a talent ecosystem poised to address the urgent need for climate solutions, and this brings me hope.",
			"Our mission began when our co-founders, Eugene and Cass, left their dream jobs at Google to pursue work that aligned with their values and concerns about the climate crisis.

Clearly their experience resonated with others and suddenly, they were talking to hundreds of people saying, \"I want to work on climate, but I don't know where to start, or if I'm even needed.\"",
			"<strong>Building a Community to Address the Climate Crisis</strong>",
			"We are now 20,000+ members strong, with people from all walks of life: from students to executives and artists to chemical engineers, spread all over the globe. Member experience is curated based on jobs, roles, topics, and geographies so users find the right information for their climate job needs. We also coordinate community events and mentorship programs, ensuring we are effective in helping members find climate work. We estimate that we have aided over 2,000 people find climate jobs and employees, start climate companies, meet mentors, investors, LPs, advisors, customers, and more. We have also helped countless others feel positively connected to peers experiencing similar climate anxiety.",
			"However, helping a few thousand people will not deploy solutions at the scale we need. We need to make the entire talent ecosystem climate-ready, and our research shows that the current system is ill-equipped to prepare individuals for climate work at the necessary scale. We need a movement to make this happen.",
			"The Work on Climate community represents the foundation of our movement. Through these relationships, we are building partnerships with organizations best fit to make large changes across industries: schools, job boards, government bodies, conferences, industry associations, and so on. These initial partnerships will create blueprints for ways in which other organizations can support the climate workforce. Our efforts also aim to eliminate silos by making the transition top of mind to both climate and mainstream workforce organizations.",
			"<strong>And we have been successful!</strong>",
			"Work on Climate's impact is not just measured by the number of individuals we have helped find climate work, but in the millions of people who will need to transition into climate-related careers to solve the climate crisis. By building a movement in the talent ecosystem, we aim to enlist the help of organizations that have the ability to reach more people. With this collective action, we can bring hundreds of millions of people into careers focused on inventing and deploying climate solutions in every industry.",

		"provider": "Zacks",

		"content": [
			"How much a stock's price changes over time is important for most investors, since price performance can both impact your investment portfolio and help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.",
			"FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.",
			"What if you'd invested in Nvidia (NVDA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to NVDA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?",
			"<b>Nvidia's Business In-Depth</b>",
			"With that in mind, let's take a look at Nvidia's main business drivers.",
			"NVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.<br/><br/>NVIDIA’s GPU success can be attributed to its parallel processing capabilities supported by thousands of computing cores, which are necessary to run deep learning algorithms. The company’s GPU platforms are playing a major role in developing multi-billion-dollar end-markets like robotics and self-driving vehicles.<br/><br/>NVIDIA is a dominant name in the Data Center, professional visualization and gaming markets where Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are playing a catch-up role. The company’s partnership with almost all major cloud service providers (CSPs) and server vendors is a key catalyst.<br/><br/>NVIDIA’s GPUs are also getting rapid adoption in diverse fields ranging from radiology to precision agriculture. The company’s GPUs power the top two supercomputers in the world, located at Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in the United States, as well as the top supercomputers in Europe and Japan. In all, NVIDIA powers 136 of the TOP500 supercomputers.<br/><br/>Santa Clara, CA-based, NVIDIA reported revenues of $26.97 billion in fiscal 2023, slightly up from $26.91 billion in fiscal 2022.<br/><br/>Beginning first-quarter fiscal 2021, NVIDIA started reporting revenues under two segments – Graphics and Compute &amp; Networking.<br/><br/>Graphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.<br/><br/>Compute &amp; Networking comprises Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; DRIVE for autonomous vehicles; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms. Mellanox revenues included in this segment beginning second-quarter fiscal 2021.<br/><br/>Graphics and Compute &amp; Networking accounted for 44% and 56% of fiscal 2023 revenues, respectively.",
			"<b>Bottom Line</b>",
			"Putting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Nvidia, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.",
			"According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in May 2013 would be worth $82,710.89, or an 8,171.09% gain, as of May 8, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.",
			"The S&amp;P 500 rose 156.21% and the price of gold increased 31.59% over the same time frame in comparison.",
			"Analysts are anticipating more upside for NVDA.",
			"NVIDIA is gaining from strong growth of artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute &amp; Networking revenues. A surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds. Collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. We expect its Automotive segment’s revenue to grow at a CAGR of 29% through fiscal 2023-2025. However, NVDA’s near-term prospects look gloomy due to weakening demand for chips used in gaming and data center end markets. While macroeconomic headwinds are impacting gaming and data center chip demand, higher channel inventory levels are hurting chip prices.",
			"Shares have gained 6.08% over the past four weeks and there have been 3 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.",

			"Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:",
			"<strong>Wingstop </strong>is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that franchises and operates restaurants under the Wingstop brand name. Its restaurants offer cooked-to-order, hand-sauced, and tossed chicken wings.",
			"The stock has been on a mission this year, already up 50% in 2023. The move stemmed from improving margins on deflation of its main product bone-in chicken wings. On top of that, sales growth has been accelerating, which has helped the company beat earnings expectations four quarters in a row.",
			"Wingstop recently reported Q1 earnings, with the results impressing inventors enough to take the stock well beyond all-time highs.",
			"Wingstop was founded in 1994 and is headquartered in Addison, Texas. The company has 1,959 global locations in eight global markets, with 228 new additions in 2022.",
			"Wingstop has a market cap of just over $6 Billion and has a Forward PE of 103. This high valuation has scared some investors away and gives the stock a Zacks Style Score of \"F\" in Value. However, the stock has a Zacks Style Score of \"A\" in Momentum.",
			"Wingstop has seen 19 years of consecutive Same Store Sales (SSS) growth and continued to see robust SSS numbers in Q1.",
			"In early May, the company reported an earnings beat of 28%. Revenues came in at $108.7M v the $101M expected. The company saw adjusted EBITDA at $34.6M, up 60% year over year.",
			"Same Store Sales were up 20% y/y and Wingstop sees FY23 SSS at \"high single-digit growth\". The company affirmed 240 net new units globally and sees 37 new opening ins Q1, up 11% y/y.",
			"CEO Michael Skipworth had the following comments on the quarter:",
			"<em>\"Our strong first quarter results reflect the continued momentum and strength of the Wingstop brand as we delivered 20.1% domestic same store sales growth, driven by transaction growth. With this underlying strength, we believe that our strategies we are executing against can deliver our 20th consecutive year of same store sales growth and another record year of unit growth for Wingstop\"  </em>",
			"The stock took flight moving from below the $200 level to $223.77. WING did come back down from those levels, but investors are clearly excited about the company's growth prospects. Despite the high valuation, the market thinks Wingstop can grow fast enough to justify its stock price.",
			"Much like Chipotle and the flying burrito stock move of 2019-20, WING has the potential to go much higher than many investors realize.",
			"The impressive quarter has forced analysts to take their numbers and price targets higher. Over the last 7 days, analysts' estimates have gone up in every time frame.",
			"For the current quarter, estimates have spiked from $0.45 to $0.49 over the last month, or 9%.",
			"For the current year, we see estimates trending higher as well. Analysts have taken their numbers from $1.91 to $2.00 or 5%.",
			"Multiple firms have taken their price targets higher since earnings:",
			"<em>RBC reiterated with a Sector Perform but listed its target to $200 from $183.</em>",
			"<em>TD Cowen maintained an Outperform and raised its target to $235 from $210.</em>",
			"<em>Wedbush maintained its Outperform and lifted its price target to $240 from $200. </em>",
			"<em>Barclays reiterated its Overweight with a new price target of $240, up from $200. </em>",
			"The stock is up about 50% on the year and many investors do not want to chase. So let us go over some buyable technical levels that bulls can look out for and enter on any pullbacks.",
			"$193 is the 21-day moving average. This is a great spot for aggressive investors to enter looking to play the momentum.",
			"$184 is the 50-day MA, a likely spot for the stock to find consolidation and a bounce.",
			"$153 is the 200-day MA and is unlikely to test anytime soon unless we have a large market sell-off. If that scenario plays out, this area would be a great spot to enter for long-term investors.",
			"For those looking to continue buying into all-time highs, look for a move to $255. This is the 161.8% Fibonacci extension found by drawing from 2021 highs to 2022 lows.",
			"While the valuation is scaring off some investors, Wingstop is hitting all-time highs and crushing earnings. Rather than focus on the valuation, investors should follow the price action as the market is trying to tell us something.",
			"As long as Wingstop continues the SSS growth and margins remain favorable, this stock will be hotter than Wingstop's very own Atomic sauce.",
			"<strong>CF Industries </strong>is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that manufactures and sells hydrogen and nitrogen products for energy, fertilizer, emissions abatement, and other industrial activities",
			"The stock did well in 2022 as grain and fertilizer prices took off. However, CF has slumped over the last six months as prices have fallen significantly.",
			"Inconsistent earnings have not helped and the stock is trading at 2023 lows after a recent earnings report. With analyst estimates falling further, investors could be in a rough spot in the back half of the year.",
			"CF Industries is headquartered in Deerfield, IL. The company was founded in 1946 and employs 2,700 people. Its principal products include anhydrous ammonia, granular urea, urea ammonium nitrate, and ammonium nitrate products. It primarily serves cooperatives, independent fertilizer distributors, traders, wholesalers, and industrial users.",
			"CF is valued at $13.5 billion and has a Forward PE of 8. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of \"A\" in Value, but \"D\" in Momentum. The stock pays a dividend of 2.3%.",
			"The company reported Q1 earnings in early May, beating expectations by 8%. Revenues also came in above expected, but gross margins fell to 42.9% from 59.2% last year.",
			"Management commented that despite the downward pressure in the global nitrogen market compared to last year, industry fundamentals remain positive.",
			"The stock did spike on the headline number, but over the next few days, the stock made new monthly lows. This is not a good sign for investors and a reason for the drop is likely due to falling estimates.",
			"While the recent earnings report has seen a mix of revisions to estimates, the trend so far this year has been lower. Looking at analyst estimates over the last 90 days, we see a significant drop across the board. ",
			"For the current quarter, estimates have been taken down from $3.70 to $2.68, a drop of 27%. For the current year, they have fallen from $13.29 to $8.98, or 32%.",
			"Next year's numbers have seen a drop of 14%, but we have seen a small tick higher over the last 7 days.",
			"Investors looking to buy the dip might have to wait until next year until the fundamental situation improves.",
			"CF has been on a downward trend since December of 2022. Since then, the stock has dropped about 35%.",
			"The 50-day moving average has been resistance multiple times since the stock started trending lower. This level, which is at $75.50, needs to break or the bears will continue to be in control.",
			"Investors are likely tempted to buy the dip, but there could be room lower. While there is value in the name, long-term support looks to be in the $55-60 range. That is over 15% lower than current prices, so investors should be patient.",
			"The fertilizer names are great to be in when agriculture prices are going higher. Unfortunately, the trend is going the wrong way and until estimates start improving investors should hold off.",
			"<strong>Palantir Technologies Inc. </strong>is slated to report its first-quarter 2023 results on May 8, after the bell.",
			"The company's earnings surprise history has not been impressive. Earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and surpassed once, delivering a negative earnings surprise of 50% on average.",
			"The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $504.8 million, indicating 13.1% year-over-year growth. The top line is expected to have benefited from strength in both the government and commercial segments. Both segments are likely to have benefited from increased contributions from existing as well as new customers.",
			"The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 4 cents per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 100%. Revenue growth and better operating performance are likely to have positively impacted the bottom line in the quarter.",
			"Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Palantir this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that's not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.",
			"Palantir has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #2.",
			"You can see <strong>the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong><strong>.</strong>",
			"Here are a couple of stocks from the broader Zacks Business Services sector that investors may consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this season:",

			"Because Uber Technologies made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually expect strong revenue growth. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit.",
			"In the last year Uber Technologies saw its revenue grow by 58%. That's stonking growth even when compared to other loss-making stocks. The solid 64% share price gain goes down pretty well, but it's not necessarily as good as you might expect given the top notch revenue growth.

			"When Apple CEO Tim Cook talks, everyone else listens.",
			"“We believe the lion’s share of tech layoffs are now in the rearview mirror with Cook’s words echoing throughout the Valley,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, who covers tech, tells me. Ives is referring to Cook’s comments on May 4 about mass layoffs: “I view that as a last resort and, so, mass layoffs is not something that we’re talking about at this moment,” he <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:told CNBC;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/04/apple-layoffs-are-a-last-resort-tim-cook-says.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">told CNBC</a>. But he didn’t rule out the possibility of job cuts.",
			"Apple has a “unique perch and perspective around consumer demand globally, and what this means for the path looking forward,” Wedbush analysts wrote in a May 1 note. So the company’s performance and practices, including Cook's current stance on mass layoffs, hold weight. In addition, Apple has more flexibility because the company has been more prudent in hiring than its peers like Meta, Google, and Amazon which have laid off thousands of employees.",
			"“Apple did not hire at the 1980s rock-star-like pace of hiring we saw from Google, Amazon, Meta, and others during the last few years,” Ives explains. “Now, Apple and Cook are in a position to gain market share and hire talent, which is a shot across the bow at the rest of the tech space.\"",
			"Apple (AAPL) announced on May 4, earnings for its quarter ending April 1. The <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:company reported;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/05/apple-reports-second-quarter-results/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">company reported</a> revenue of $94.8 billion, down 3%, but beating analysts’ expectations. iPhone revenue of $51.33 billion beat analysts' estimate of $48.84 billion. Apple set an all-time record for Services (including App Store, Apple Pay, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and iCloud) reaching $20.91 billion. In the Mac unit, sales fell 31% to $7.2 billion, and iPad saw revenue fall 13% to $6.7 billion. Wedbush maintained an outperform rating for AAPL. On May 5, the stock price jumped 4.7% closing at $173.57. With Apple’s better-than-expected performance and favorable U.S. jobs data, the Dow had its <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:best day since Jan. 6;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/futures-climb-apple-earnings-cheer-key-jobs-report-tap-2023-05-05/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">best day since Jan. 6</a>.",
			"The mega-cap tech giant has, so far, been able to avoid mass layoffs and still remain profitable. That brings to mind a question my colleague Geoff Colvin brings up in a recent report—<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:are layoffs a confession of bad management;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/layoffs-2023-bad-management/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">are layoffs a confession of bad management</a>?",
			"“Layoffs are definitely a confession of poor management,” Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford Business School, told Colvin. Pfeffer’s reasoning is that “research shows that generally, layoffs don’t improve a company’s fortunes,” Colvin writes. “Quite the opposite: They don’t reliably raise a company’s profits or stock price, but they do reliably reduce remaining employees’ morale, commitment, productivity, and trust.”",
			"Are there difficult moments when layoffs are the best of bad options? “The evidence seems pretty clear that except for really unusual situations—the company is about to go under, it’s the start of the Great Recession—large layoffs actually seem to hamper the ability to restart when things improve,” Peter Cappelli, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, told Colvin.",

The Bill Gates-founded company signed a deal to use OpenAI’s technology in its Bing search engine and reportedly invested $10bn (£7.95bn) in the company.",
			"ChatGPT offers Microsoft a chance to leapfrog Google in search, but the technology offers far more than just that. Chief executive Satya Nadella has said AI will shape everything the company does in future.",
			"During an unexpectedly sunny visit to Microsoft’s usually rain soaked campus in Redmond, Washington, executives demonstrate ways in which they hope AI will boost its business.",
			"One example: the technology has been plugged into its Powerpoint software to help office workers complete hours of work on presentations in minutes.",
			"A series of bullet points fed to Copilot — Microsoft’s name for its AI chatbot integrations — result in the creation of an entire slide deck, complete with stock images, corporate branding and even the right colour scheme. Full sentences extrapolated from the terse bullet points garnish each slide.",
			"Walter Sun, the company’s vice president of AI for business applications, believes Copilot could even become an “autopilot” by 2028. Rather than tasking a human to oversee the creation of a slide deck with the help of AI, an executive could simply ask software directly to do all the legwork.",
			"“We start by shipping features where there's a human in the loop to make sure everything works,” says Sun. “Maybe in five years, these things will become more self-service. I think it’s possible”.",
			"Copilot was first trialled commercially on GitHub, a Microsoft-owned collaboration website for software developers. Instead of humans writing code and then posting it to GitHub for others to critique (and borrow from), Microsoft used the GPT programme to create a virtual assistant capable of writing software code all by itself in response to user prompts.",
			"AI assistants within Microsoft’s products will become ubiquitous, writing code, emails and Powerpoint presentations for people why they deal with less automatable tasks such as meetings and presentations.",
			"However, limiting the role of humans in day-to-day business raises knotty questions.",
			"“The question is, are we designing PowerPoint in a way that takes away my agency, my humanity?” asks Frank Shaw, the company’s marketing chief. “Or are we empowering them to spend more time on the parts that matter?”",
			"It is also an ominous portent for white collar workers. Just as advances in machinery have left scores of blue collar workers on the sidelines over the past century, AI could make many office jobs of today redundant.",
			"IBM chief executive Arvind Krishna recently said that thousands of back office staff are likely to be “replaced by AI and automation over the next five years”.

			"Connor Axiotes, a researcher at think tank the Adam Smith Institute, believes mass adoption of AI will lead to higher levels of unemployment in a way that no other past technologies have.",
			"“Future AI systems will have superhuman labour abilities, be smarter than humans, and encroach on a domain that no transformative technology ever has – cognitive labour,” he says.",
			"“That part of working ability which has been humanity's comparative advantage will no longer be so. This is why I think, more than ever, we are likely to see these stickier kinds of unemployment.”",
			"Jon Friedman, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of design and research, is sanguine.",
			"“In every age in the history of technology, the thing that we thought was going to replace human jobs created more human jobs,” he says.",
			"Microsoft’s representatives are keen to stress that the company wants to “augment” what people can do with AI instead of replacing them outright. Yet it is difficult to ignore the potential for AI to destroy jobs, even in its current state.",
			"Even as tech companies plough ahead, there’s the question of whether AI is good enough to do the job in the first place.",
			"During the Copilot trial on GitHub, one software developer complained that the AI sometimes “suggests things that are just wrong”. Another said using the product was akin to “having to deal with a trainee programmer who knows how to search on Google” — not a glowing endorsement.",
			"ChatGPT has a well documented tendency to “hallucinate”: produce convincing-sounding answers to questions that are in fact wrong. Plagiarism is also an issue when it comes to creating new material such as code or Powerpoint presentations.",
			"Rashik Parmar, chief executive of the British Computer Society, says that AI programmes such as ChatGPT are “only as good as the source of data” used to train them.",
			"He warns: “If somebody intentionally starts to poison some of the data sources, without you knowing about it, then that can create all kinds of ramifications, right?",
			"“We're all super excited about what can be done without really thinking through the potential risks.”",
			"Some people are: hundreds of tech leaders including Tesla chief executive Elon Musk penned a recent letter calling for a moratorium on AI development until the risks were properly understood.

			"Professor Mike Wooldridge of the Alan Turing Institute says: “What we're seeing is a massive pivot in Big Tech towards this technology, because this finally delivered a mass market product for AI.",
			"“They're all broadly in the same sort of ballpark... But OpenAI and Microsoft have basically got a year's head start.”",
			"OpenAI ultimately aims to create “artificial general intelligence” (AGI), regarded by most researchers as the field’s Holy Grail: the creation of true machine consciousness. AGI would allow machines to essentially think for themselves and this breakthrough moment could be reached within years, some in the field believe.",
			"It is AGI that pessimists are most worried about. Once machines can be set off to complete tasks with relative autonomy, how can we control what they do? Thought experiments abound about how relatively simple commands could lead to the end of humanity.",
			"Would Microsoft adopt AGI if OpenAI creates it?",
			"“Honestly, I don’t know,” Eric Boyd, the company’s corporate vice president of AI platform technology, says in Redmond. It is difficult to speculate “on this thing that doesn’t exist”, he says.",

			"\"TSMC has fallen behind its peers in the fight against climate change, when it should be an industry leader,\" she said in a statement on Monday. \"TSMC has the potential to purchase and install rooftop solar, and to leverage its influence to accelerate Taiwan's energy transition.\"",
			"TSMC's outsized role in chip manufacturing has come under increasing scrutiny amid growing concerns about the environmental impact of the semiconductor supply chain. As the supplier of more than 90 per cent of the world's most advanced chips, it contracts with the biggest tech companies in the world, including Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and many top gadget brands.",
			"The global semiconductor manufacturing industry is projected to consume 286 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity globally by 2030, more than double its power usage in 2021, and is on track to emit 86 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2030, more than double Portugal's total emissions of 40.8 million tons in 2021, according to a Greenpeace report last month.",
			"TSMC relies heavily on fossil fuels, with renewable energy comprising only 9 per cent of its total energy usage in 2021, according to Greenpeace. At the same time, the company's electricity consumption is on track to nearly triple by 2030, using as much electricity as 5.8 million people - roughly a quarter of Taiwan's population.",
			"\"TSMC is rapidly expanding its energy-intensive facilities both in Asia and in the US, but currently this expansion is increasing demand for fossil fuels,\" said Gary Cook, global climate campaigns director at Stand.earth.",
			"\"TSMC's failure to invest in renewable energy that will decarbonise the grid is not only a climate catastrophe, but also a business risk for TSMC and its most important customers,\" he said.",
			"In a written statement sent to the Post, TSMC said it has been actively engaging in the clean transition of its semiconductor production process.",
			"\"TSMC regards renewable energy as an important strategy towards net-zero emissions,\" the company said on Friday. \"The cornerstone of TSMC's sustainable management is green manufacturing and the company integrates this into daily operations through the introduction of innovative green technologies and initiatives.\"",
			"It established the Net Zero Project in 2020 to discuss and evaluate the company's 2050 emission goals and signed the world's largest renewable corporate power purchase agreement with Danish energy company Orsted in 2020 to buy 920 megawatts of renewable power in the next 20 years.",
			"TSMC also announced last month that it had signed a 20-year procurement contract for a total of 20,000 Gigawatt-hours (GWh) of renewable energy with local energy company Ark Power to offer the chip maker's suppliers and subsidiaries electricity evaluation and planning services.",
			"\"TSMC will continue to set related mitigation measures, strengthen its wide variety of green innovations, lead the industry with a goal of building a green supply chain and actively adopt renewable energy to reach its goal of net-zero emissions by 2050,\" the company said.",
			"Tracy Cheng, climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia said the coalition of environmental groups will continue to engage with TSMC about its energy transition.",

			"The company, which plans to add further Indian languages to the service, showcased an AI voice trial chat in the Bhojpuri language native to parts of northern India. The AI agent offered airline information, flight dates, timings and pricing. After choosing a trip, users received a QR code to help them complete a payment.",

			"The world’s most populous country has 800 million internet and 600 million smartphone users, but only about 150 million of those make purchases online and high-frequency transactors are just half that, Magow estimates.

			"<span><span><strong>Tech Stocks Climb the Wall of Worry</strong></span></span>",
			"<span><span>From a macro perspective, investors have deep-rooted concerns about the current stock market, including a potential looming recession, stubborn inflation, a debt crisis, geopolitical escalations, and more. Small-cap stocks within the <strong>Russell 2000 Index ETF (</strong></span></span>IWM<span><span><strong>)</strong> have dragged as regional banking stocks within the <strong>SPDR Regional Bank ETF (</strong></span></span>KRE<span><span><strong>)</strong> continue to struggle.  </span></span>",
			"<span><span>However, despite the fear-mongering from many investors and the underperformance in some regions of the market, tech has marched higher in a stair-stepping fashion thus far in 2023. Currently, it is in the process of breaking out.</span></span>",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span>",
			"<span><span>Despite a rough period of outperformance in 2022, it’s easy to see why investors are anxious to get exposure to the <strong>Nasdaq 100 ETF (</strong></span></span>QQQ<span><span><strong>). </strong>Over the past 20 years, the returns have been stellar from both a total return and a relative basis. Since 2003, the QQQ has returned 982.8% versus just 541.5% for the S&amp;P 500 Index.</span></span>",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span>",
			"<span><span>Though tech has dominated in 2023, not all tech stocks are created equally. For example, former high-flying, lesser-quality tech stocks such as <strong>Block (</strong></span></span>SQ<span><span><strong>)</strong> and <strong>Zoom (</strong></span></span>ZM<span><span><strong>)</strong> are still stuck in downtrends. Conversely, stocks such as <strong>Apple (</strong></span></span>AAPL<span><span><strong>)</strong> and <strong>Microsoft (</strong></span></span>MSFT<span><span><strong>)</strong> have performed so well that they now account for nearly 14% of the S&amp;P 500 Index – the highest weighting for two companies in at least 40 years. So, it’s clear - investors are gravitating toward large-cap, institutional quality stocks with loads of cash.</span></span>",
			"<span><span>While stocks like AAPL, MSFT, and <strong>Shopify (</strong></span></span>SHOP<span><span><strong>)</strong> have performed well, new buyers looking to enter tech need to be strategic and not chase stretched charts. Below are three high-quality tech stocks setting up:</span></span>",
			"<span><span>My first pick is <strong>Alphabet (</strong></span></span>GOOGL<span><span><strong>). </strong>One of my favorite indications that a position will move higher occurs when a stock can shake off bad news quickly. My thinking is that if bad news is no news, no news should equate to good news.</span></span>",
			"<span><span>In early February, GOOGL shares tanked more than 10% after its AI chatbot Bard, made a mistake in its public-facing demo. While it was not a good look for the company or the stock, bargain hunters used the sell-off as an opportunity to accumulate shares. Last week, in a show of conviction, insiders scooped up a cool $20 million worth of the company’s stock. GOOGL is a mega-cap tech name that will essentially track the Q’s but should outperform to the upside over the next 6-12 months.</span></span>",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span>",
			"<span><span>My next choice is <strong>Oracle (</strong></span></span>ORCL<span><span><strong>)</strong>. Oracle is one of the largest enterprise-grade database, middleware, and application software providers. In recent years, Oracle has expanded its cloud computing operations dramatically. The company offers cloud solutions and services that are used to build and manage various cloud deployment models. Oracle also entered the hardware business after acquiring Sun Microsystems several years ago.</span></span>",
			"<span><span>Despite Oracle’s massive size, it is not talked about as much as stocks such as Microsoft or Amazon Oracle is not as “sexy” as these companies; however, it produces a ton of revenue and is a dominant player in its space. Furthermore, though Oracle has a beta of just 1 (the same volatility as the S&amp;P 500 Index), it has outperformed 92% of stocks. Low volatility and high returns are the combination that makes for an excellent addition to any portfolio. Last week, Oracle broke out of a classic bull flag pattern on expanding volume.</span></span>",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span>",
			"<span><span>When discussing dominance and quality in the software space, it is impossible to leave out <strong>Salesforce (</strong></span></span>CRM<span><span><strong>)</strong>. Salesforce is the world’s leading Customer Relationship Management (CRM) company. Though CRM’s earnings growth slowed briefly during the uncertainty of the pandemic, the company is beginning to reap the benefits of its recent acquisition spree. Over the past few years, CRM has acquired Microsoft Teams competitor Slack, Tableau, ClickSoftware, and Mulesoft. Furthermore, key strategic partnership agreements with Alphabet and <strong>Amazon (</strong></span></span>AMZN<span><span><strong>)</strong> have helped the company to bolster growth. Last quarter, earnings growth rocketed by 100% year-over-year.</span></span>",
			"<span><span>Beyond a resumption of strong growth, CRM is very attractive from a valuation perspective. CRM’s P/E ratio of ~37 is the lowest in at least ten years.</span></span>",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span>",
			"<span><span>Technically, the stock is consolidating in a bullish manner as it approaches its 50-day moving average for the first time since breaking out earlier this year. The first pullback to the 50-day moving average should offer investors a low-risk entry point and give them a chance to gain a cushion in the stock before it reports earnings at the end of the month.</span></span>",

			"(Bloomberg) -- Warren Buffett said he prefers deploying capital in Japan instead of Taiwan, lamenting how geopolitics led his firm to cut stakes in the island’s chip-maker giant.",

			"That didn’t stop Berkshire from slashing its holding in TSMC by 86% during the fourth quarter, after reporting a $5 billion investment in November — a move Buffett has blamed on rising tensions between China and Taiwan.",
			"Buffett urged China and the US to keep a lid on their rivalry.",
			"“It’s imperative that China and the United States both understand what the game is and that you can’t push too hard,” he said at the meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. “Both places are going to be competitive and both can prosper.”",
			"Speaking at the same event, Buffett’s long-time business partner Charlie Munger called for “reciprocal kindness” between the two superpowers.",
			"TSMC rose as much as 1.8% in Taipei on Monday morning.",
			"Buffett signaled a willingness to make further investments in Japan after recently raising stakes in trading companies there. Berkshire now owns 7.4% of those businesses, but won’t go over 9%, he said.",
			"Greg Abel, the heir apparent to Buffett who joined him on a trip to Japan last month, called them “an incredible” investment.",
			"Buffett said he wanted to introduce Abel to executives from the five trading houses, recognizing that there will be continued investments and relationships there.",
			"Japan’s trading houses — or “sogo shosha” — have deep roots in the country’s economy, dating back hundreds of years, and provide everything from food to energy.",
			"Shares of Itochu Corp. rose as much as 1.5% on Monday morning in Tokyo. Mitsubishi Corp. and Sumitomo Corp. also gained, while Marubeni Corp. was little changed and Mitsui &amp; Co. fell.",

With 66% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).",
			"And things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$23b in market cap last week. One-year return to shareholders is currently 54% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.",

			"Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.",
			"NVIDIA already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see NVIDIA's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.",
			"Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in NVIDIA. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.3% of shares outstanding. With 7.3% and 5.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and FMR LLC are the second and third largest shareholders. Additionally, the company's CEO Jen-Hsun Huang directly holds 3.5% of the total shares outstanding.",
			"A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.",
			"Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.",
			"The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.",

			"For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.",
			"Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like <strong>Analog Devices</strong> (<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:NASDAQ:ADI;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-adi/analog-devices?blueprint=2498663&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=intro&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NASDAQ:ADI</a>).

			"If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. It certainly is nice to see that Analog Devices has managed to grow EPS by 27% per year over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.",
			"Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The music to the ears of Analog Devices shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 28% to 34% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.",

Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$326m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.4% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.",
			"If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Analog Devices' strong EPS growth. With EPS growth rates like that, it's hardly surprising to see company higher-ups place confidence in the company through continuing to hold a significant investment.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 77% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).",
			"And institutional investors saw their holdings value drop by 5.2% last week. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 8.7% for shareholders. Often called “market makers”, institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Accenture, which might have negative implications on individual investors.",

			"Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index.

			"As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Accenture. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Accenture, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.",
			"Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Accenture. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.2% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.5% and 4.1% of the stock.",
			"A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.",
			"While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.",
			"The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.",

			"Readers hoping to buy <strong>SAP SE</strong> (<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:ETR:SAP;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/de/software/etr-sap/sap-shares?blueprint=2498028&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=intro&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ETR:SAP</a>) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Accordingly, SAP investors that purchase the stock on or after the 12th of May will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 16th of May.",
			"The company's upcoming dividend is €2.05 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of €2.05 per share to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that SAP has a trailing yield of 1.7% on the current share price of €122.18. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether SAP can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.",

			"Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. SAP distributed an unsustainably high 143% of its profit as dividends to shareholders last year. Without extenuating circumstances, we'd consider the dividend at risk of a cut. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It paid out more than half (62%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.",
			"It's good to see that while SAP's dividends were not covered by profits, at least they are affordable from a cash perspective. If executives were to continue paying more in dividends than the company reported in profits, we'd view this as a warning sign. Very few companies are able to sustainably pay dividends larger than their reported earnings.",

			"Businesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Readers will understand then, why we're concerned to see SAP's earnings per share have dropped 16% a year over the past five years. Ultimately, when earnings per share decline, the size of the pie from which dividends can be paid, shrinks.",
			"Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, SAP has lifted its dividend by approximately 9.2% a year on average. That's intriguing, but the combination of growing dividends despite declining earnings can typically only be achieved by paying out a larger percentage of profits. SAP is already paying out a high percentage of its income, so without earnings growth, we're doubtful of whether this dividend will grow much in the future.",
			"Is SAP an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Earnings per share have been in decline, which is not encouraging. Worse, SAP's paying out a majority of its earnings and more than half its free cash flow. Positive cash flows are good news but it's not a good combination. It's not the most attractive proposition from a dividend perspective, and we'd probably give this one a miss for now.",
			"Having said that, if you're looking at this stock without much concern for the dividend, you should still be familiar of the risks involved with SAP.

			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Welcome to Yahoo Finance's special coverage of the 2023 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting, known as the Woodstock of capitalism. And it's among the biggest events of the year for investors. We'll hear from legendary investor and Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett, along with his Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, as they give us their unique take on what's been a complicated year for the markets.",
			"A banking crisis, a slowing economy, geopolitical tensions, accelerated digital transformation with AI and a lot more, it's all on the agenda today. We're breaking down the big news from today's meeting and what's happening to the markets and your money.",
			"Brian Sozzi of Yahoo Finance here with Yahoo Finance's head of news, Myles Udland. And Myles and I, along with all of these people, are streaming out of the CHI Health Center in Omaha, Nebraska, have been ingesting hours and hours of Warren Buffett's insights into the economy and stocks alongside his right-hand man, Vice Chair Charlie Munger. And of course, we have a lot of takeaways.",
			"But let's start with three from this really celebration of capitalism, as those Berkshire shareholders love to call it. First off, the big banks, everybody in this room was waiting, Myles, to hear from Buffett on his views on the banks. Of course, First Republic now owned by JP Morgan, Buffett really not disappointing. Out of all the bank stocks that he talked about and the sector itself, he said he liked Bank of America, which he owns 13% of.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, well, so he came through his prepared remarks, which he said will be brief. They ran about 18 minutes, which I guess for Buffett--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> That's brief.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> --counts as brief. And we kind of got right into it with the regional banks. And really the question was, what would have happened had the deposits of Silicon Valley Bank not been insured, and ultimately Buffett going with what I think most people would have expected him to say, where he said it would have been catastrophic.",
			"And I think, you know, Sozzi, it brings me back to that weekend where the bank is seized by regulators Friday morning. And everyone's thinking what's going to happen over the weekend. Ultimately FDIC comes out. They say we're going to backstop these.",
			"And throughout the proceedings there were a couple of questions in this direction. And I think Buffett's takeaway is that effectively all deposits in the US are now backstopped.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> That's good.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Whether they say that or not.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> That's good. And that, of course, as well, Myles, as well, but come Monday morning's open for the market--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> I didn't get the sense that Buffett signaled to the world, go out and buy bank stocks. He sounded like many other people are, yeah, they might do this. They might do that. But I didn't hear that same tone compared to what I heard from Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, a couple of days at Milken, where she said things are stable. I just didn't get that vibe.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, I mean, we'll get to it in a little bit with his comments on Bank of America in more detail. But he did say that if you are an investor in banks right now or a prospective investor, I think he said, if you're a bank shareholder to use his phrase exactly, kind of hard to know what you buy, or what you're owning I guess in that situation. And a lot of it for him has to go with what are deposits.",
			"And he mentioned how sticky are deposits now, because did the whole wind-up. You don't have to stand in line to take him out of a bank. You can just go on your phone and pull your money. Obviously a dynamic that we saw with the Fed's report and the FDIC's report a couple of weeks ago is what happened at Silicon Valley Bank.",
			"What has been happening in the sector is people are wondering who is next. But really I think from Buffett's view, there's just a perception right now that you do not know for sure for sure what the business of a bank exactly looks like.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> And, you know, you mentioned Bank of America, Myles, and you're a student of Warren Buffett and this meeting, been coming to it for many years. I can't say I'm surprised that he called out Bank of America. Of course he owns 13% of it. But under CEO Brian Moynihan, they aren't necessarily out there taking these crazy risks that a lot of these other regional banks are. So a different company, but again, Buffett, being Buffett, suggesting that Bank of America is doing something right in this climate.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, and ultimately I think his takeaway was, well, I bought the thing back in 2011. He puts a bunch of capital in it. And I guess I'm going to see that through 12 years later.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Yep, absolutely. All right, well, outside the bank, of course, another takeaway we have is AI. So everybody was focused on what Buffett and Munger had to say on banks, but also artificial intelligence. And again, I'm going back. I'm thinking through the stock action on Monday. I just don't think these AI stocks, which have been really hot, come out blasting off of what Warren Buffett said out of the gate here.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> I mean sure, if you're trying to play the AI stocks--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> I'm trying to, I'm trying.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Based on what Warren Buffett is going to do, I mean, I don't really know if I can help you with that. But I think that the AI interaction there, and that was, I think, question two, three, four. It was right up there on the proceedings. It really got us our first great Mungerism of the day, when you're talking about what's the power of AI, this, that, and the other. And of course Charlie hits us with, well, I think old fashioned intelligence works just fine. We don't need the artificial stuff.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> There's nothing wrong with that.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> The good old fashioned intelligence is just fine in his view.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> But it is interesting that they view AI, they first went to BYD robots. Of course BYD is that electric car company. That's their first interpretation of what AI is, not Microsoft.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Buffett and that Bill Gates relationship, not what they're doing, robots making cars.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> And I think that the reason that people come to this event, and the reason that Warren and Charlie have an audience, is because they are representative in a lot of ways of the median investor's view on this. And sure, you talked a lot of people who get really excited about language learning models and all these kinds of AGI, right? It's not just AI. It's artificial general intelligence.",
			"And they're just like, I mean, we have robots, you know. Robots are fine. And also in this section, too, I think it's the first time of many times where we got to what if he references to nuclear weapons.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Yes.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> And the technology--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Which he always does, which he does in the past.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Is a regular feature of these. But I think that the risk of-- like the nuclear risk to Buffett is sort of the go to zero risk. And obviously in the '60s, very formative time in his career, and it's something that he brings up quite a bit.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> So bottom line with that takeaway, folks, is if you were looking for Warren Buffett to pitch shares of C3AI, not going to happen. Next take away, of course, value investing. That's why a lot of people that I've talked to at this event, that's why they come here, to get a sense of what Warren Buffett sees in terms of value. And it was interesting what he said on value investing, Myles.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, and, you know, I think this is where we saw the biggest distance between Warren and Charlie. Charlie Munger, very pessimistic on it, he said, I just think it's going to be worse in the future. And Buffett coming back and saying, well, you know, Charlie, you always say that.",
			"And I think that to use Munger's exact quote, my advice to value investors is get used to making less money. And you see the folks kind of behind us here certainly this morning teeming into the building, you know, people in sport coats and khakis, value types. I overheard quite a few conversations on my way in to that effect.",
			"And they weren't just trying to give some encouragement to the crowd. And this is where we kind of got to a Warren zinger, perhaps, where your biggest opportunity as an investor, value or otherwise, is other people doing dumb things.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Yeah, a lot of folks mistaking me for a hedge fund manager at this event. I also point out--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Well, you're dressed like one.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> I know.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> I'm dressed like a normal person. You're dressed like a hedge fund manager.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> I know. Well, I also, on value investing, I caught up with Whitney Tilson, longtime Buffett follower and friend of our shows. He said based on his models, he said this after the event, he calculates that Berkshire is trading at a 13% discount to intrinsic value. So if value investing is really dead, what do you do with Berkshire stock if it is that undervalued?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, well, what did Warren say? $504 billion on a GAAP basis is what the stock is worth? And you kind of, or I think it's $504,000 per share. You do the quick and dirty math on that, divided by the 1,500, you get 333 for B shares, and I think they closed around 320 on Friday.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> All right.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> So, I mean, Whitney always-- I've been in many presentations at this event with Whitney telling me that I should be buying Berkshire Hathaway. So I don't think you're going to get a different answer from him at other points in time.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Fair enough. All right, of course, we have a rapid-fire section for you as well, hitting a lot of these favorite Yahoo Finance tickers. First off Apple, of course, Apple is a key holder, a key holding inside of Berkshire Hathaway. And Myles, naturally, it took a little while to get that Apple question. But it was interesting how it was posed to him.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> It did, and we kind of got to it in two ways. I think what'll draw the headlines is Buffett saying, you know, I don't understand the product at all, or I don't understand the phone. But I understand the business. He understands the business of selling phones, not necessarily how one makes a phone.",
			"But that also got into really what I think Apple has become the most instructive holding within Berkshire's portfolio. They pay a huge dividend. So every quarter, they're getting hundreds of millions-- they're getting $100 million check, or it's not, it's much larger than that. But nine figure check coming to Berkshire Hathaway.",
			"Second thing, they buy back a lot of stock. So Berkshire's holdings in Apple, its percentage of the company that it owns, has gone up organically over time. We saw the announcement on Thursday night from Apple increasing the size of that buyback authorization.",
			"So it's going to continue to go up. And it led to this discussion of how much Apple do you really own. And you look at the equity portfolio, it's out 40%. And Buffett was like, it's not 40%. We own a bunch of other stuff, See's Candies, Garanimals, got tons of runs in a kid's clothing brand. Tons of run today. But basically being like we're not 35% Apple, because our equity holdings are only a small chunk of the whole Berkshire family.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> You look at Apple and you have to think, is this the new Coca-Cola for this generation in terms of an investment for Warren Buffett. Is this Warren Buffett connecting with that next generation of investors?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> I mean, I think, look, you can kind of say, and Buffett would probably say this, doesn't really matter what the product is. They have a dominant position in the market. They make a ton of money. They return a bunch of that money to shareholders.",
			"So whether you're selling Coca-Cola or you're selling iPhones, it hits all those criteria. And whatever generation you want to call any company, any company coming from, Buffett's going to like those characteristics.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Next up rapid-fire session here, Paramount. Of course, on Friday the stock got absolutely slaughtered, slashing its dividend, bad quarter, lots of losses. And one thing that stuck with me from that quarter from Paramount, Myles, when I talked to Amex's CEO, Stephen Squeri, that story is on our homepage now. He says do not surprise Warren Buffett.",
			"To me he sounded surprised this event. He did not come out and say, you know, Bob Bakish is a phenomenal manager. Of course that's the CEO of Paramount. He didn't do it. He didn't do it.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Well, we just talked about how Warren Buffett likes companies that return a lot of capital to shareholders. What did Paramount come out and do on Thursday? They cut their dividend. And Buffett says never good when a company announces a material cut to their dividend.",
			"You're trying to shore up your capital position. You can't give it back to your owners basically. So I'll be interested to see what happens with that position. It kind of is a small part of the Berkshire equity portfolio, kind of came up-- I won't say out of nowhere, he has a long history investing in the media business, but all of a sudden it's a bunch of Paramount. Now he owns 93 million shares of the company.",
			"And so we get into the conversation about the streaming wars. And I thought his comments on your eyeballs were quite hilarious.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Yeah, eyeballs matter, but in that--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> He goes everyone loves to use their eyes.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> No, yes, and that's key, he's clearly bullish eyes. But in that context, there's a lot of competition for our eyeballs, which is why I think that stake in Paramount disclosed in November last year raised a lot of eyebrows, because it wasn't really Warren Buffetty.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> I think everyone thinks the same thing, and, you know, look, the 13F will come out, I guess what, middle of next week, what they did or didn't do in the first quarter. So I think some questions there with that position.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> We're keeping it moving here, Taiwan Semiconductor, a position that Buffett took, what was it, late last year. And then he exited very quickly, not a very Warren Buffett type of move. But he did heap a lot of praise on that company.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, I mean, I'll kick this one right back to you, because you wrote up a quick story for us on this one. He heaped a lot of praise on it. And he kind of had a weird-- I don't know, I couldn't make sense of exactly what the point was on not wanting exposure to Taiwan, but saying US-China relations might be fine. Everyone has blame. I couldn't quite sort that one out.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Yeah, and if you're an Intel and you're a lot of these other chip-makers, to not hear Warren Buffett say you're doing cool stuff, not exactly a great thing. Lastly, Occidental Petroleum. Of course, a lot of investors, Warren Buffett built its position or his position in Occidental Petroleum under the potential, maybe goes out and just buys the darn company. But Warren said, eh-eh, unlikely to happen.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> He was very blunt. We are not going to make a play to take control of the company. They have approval to buy up to 50% of the outstanding shares. I think they own about 25% today. But, yeah, there was an analyst that talked to our RNS friend Josh Schafer last week who surmised maybe Vicki Hollub, CEO, would come in and run Berkshire Hathaway Energy when Greg Abel moves on. I mean, maybe that could happen.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Ooh, that's good.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, it was a good one in the story. But Buffett kind of squashing that today.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> And then final takeaways, Myles, to you. You first.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Really crowded, man, this place is crowded. This place yesterday, extremely stressful going in the Convention Hall.",

			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Of course, we have a rapid-fire section for you as well, hitting a lot of these favorite Yahoo Finance tickers. First off, Apple, of course, Apple is a key holding inside of Berkshire Hathaway. And Myles, naturally, it took a little while to get that Apple question. But it was interesting how it was posed to them.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> It did. And we kind of got to it in two ways. I think what will draw the headlines is Buffett saying, I don't understand the product at all, or I don't understand the phone, but I understand the business. He understands the business of selling phones not necessarily how one makes a phone.",
			"But that also got into really what I think-- Apple has become the most instructive holding within Berkshire's portfolio. They pay a huge dividend. So every quarter, they're getting hundreds of-- they're getting $100 million check, or it's not-- it's much larger than that. But nine-figure check coming to Berkshire Hathaway.",
			"Second thing, they buy back a lot of stock. So Berkshire's holdings in Apple, its percentage of the company that it owns, has gone up organically over time. We saw the announcement on Thursday night from Apple increasing the size of that buyback authorization. So it's going to continue to go up.",
			"And it led to this discussion of how much Apple do you really own? And you look at the equity portfolio. It's about 40%. And Buffett was like, it's not 40%. We own a bunch of other stuff, See's Candies. Garanimals got tons of runs today, kids clothing brand, tons of run today.",
			"But basically being like we're not 35% Apple because our equity holdings are only a small chunk of the whole Berkshire family.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> You look at Apple. And you have to think, is this the new Coca-Cola for this generation in terms of an investment for Warren Buffett? Is this Warren Buffett connecting with that next generation of investors?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> I mean, I think look, you can kind of say-- and Buffett would probably say this. It doesn't really matter what the product is. They have a dominant position in the market. They make a ton of money. They return a bunch of that money to shareholders. So whether you're selling Coca-Cola or you're selling iPhones, it hits all those criteria.",
			"And whatever generation you want to call any company coming from, Buffett's going to like those characteristics.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Next up, rapid fire session here. Paramount, of course, on Friday, the stock got absolutely slaughtered, slashing its dividend, bad quarter, lots of losses. And one thing that stuck with me from that quarter from Paramount, Myles, when I talk to AmEx's CEO Steven Squeri-- that story is on our home page now. He says, do not surprise Warren Buffett.",
			"To me, he sounded surprised at this event. He did not come out and say, Bob Bakish is a phenomenal manager. Of course, that's the CEO of Paramount. He didn't do it. He didn't do it.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Well, we just talked about how Warren Buffett likes companies that return a lot of capital to shareholders. What did Paramount come out and do on Thursday? They cut their dividend. And Buffett says, never good when a company announces a material cut to their dividend. You're trying to shore up your capital position when you can't give it back to your owners basically.",
			"So I'll be interested to see what happens with that position. It kind of-- it's a small part of the Berkshire equity portfolio. It kind of came up-- I don't want to say out of nowhere. He has a long history of investing in the media business. But all of a sudden, it's like, oh, Buffett owns a bunch of Paramount. Now he owns 93 million shares of the company.",
			"And so we get into the conversation about the streaming wars. And I thought his comments on your eyeballs were quite hilarious.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Yeah, eyeballs matter. But in that--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> He goes, everyone loves to use their eyes.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> No, yes. It's key. He's clearly bullish eyes. But in that context, there's a lot of competition for our eyeballs, which is why I think that stake in Paramount, disclosed in November last year, raised a lot of eyebrows because it wasn't really Warren Buffetty.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> I think everyone thinks the same thing. And look, the 13-F will come out, I guess, what, middle of next week, what they did or didn't do in the first quarter. So I think some questions there with that position.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> We're keeping moving here, Taiwan Semiconductor a position that Buffett took-- what was it, late last year? And then he exited it very quickly, not a very Warren Buffett type of move. But he did hear a lot of praise on that company.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, I mean, I'll kick this one right back to you because you wrote up a quick story for us on this one. He heaped a lot of praise on it. And he kind of had a-- I don't know. I couldn't make sense of exactly what the point was on not wanting exposure to Taiwan but saying US-China relations might be fine. Everyone has blame. I couldn't quite sort that one out.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Yeah. And if you're an Intel and you're a lot of these other chip-makers, to not hear Warren Buffett say you're doing cool stuff, eh, not exactly a great thing.",
			"Lastly, Occidental Petroleum, of course, a lot of investors have been watching Warren Buffett build its position or his position in Occidental Petroleum under the potential, maybe he goes out and just buys the darn company. But Warren said, eh, eh, eh, unlikely to happen.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> He came-- he was very blunt. We were not going to make a play to take control of the company. They have approval to buy up to 50% of the outstanding shares. I think they own about 25% today. But yeah, there was an analyst that talked to our Ines Ferre and Josh Shafer last week who surmised maybe Vicki Hollub, CEO, would come in and run Berkshire Hathaway Energy when Greg Abel moves on. I mean, maybe that could happen.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Ooh, that's good.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, it was a good one in the story. But Buffett kind of squashing that today.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> And then final takeaways. Myles, to you first.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Really crowded. Man, this place is crowded. Yesterday, extremely stressful going in the convention hall.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> For me, two takeaways. One, amazing to see Warren Buffett, 92 years old, Charlie Munger, 99 old, answering all these questions, in top form. I'm just fascinated by the whole thing. And the next, last but not least, on Monday, \"the Morning Brief\" newsletter, please do check that out, subscribe, whatever. We're looking into the succession battle-- not battle, succession plan here for Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway, lots of interesting little nuggets that our team pulled here from the event.",

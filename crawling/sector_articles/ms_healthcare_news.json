			"Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss company earnings, focusing efforts on fighting cancer, consumer health, and cutting roughly 10% of the global healthcare company’s experimental drug pipeline.",
			"[AUDIO LOGO]",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JULIE HYMAN:</span> Well, Swiss pharma giant Novartis beat analyst estimates in late April, delivering strong sales growth, margin expansion, also raised its full-year guidance. The company also announced plans to cut its experimental drug pipeline by roughly 10% and is focusing efforts on fighting cancer in particular.",
			"Here to discuss is Vas Narasimhan, who is Novartis CEO, joined by Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. Well, Vas, it's great to see you in person here in New York.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">VAS NARASIMBAN:</span> It's great to see you as well, Julie.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JULIE HYMAN:</span> Yeah.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">VAS NARASIMBAN:</span> Great to be here.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JULIE HYMAN:</span> Thanks for being here. So you have been making some interesting moves here in terms of focusing your drug portfolio. But there is one drug I want to ask you about in particular, and that's Kisqali, if I'm saying that--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">VAS NARASIMBAN:</span> That's right. That's right, yeah.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JULIE HYMAN:</span> --correctly, which is to treat breast cancer. And you've seen some progress there. What's the potential for a drug like that for Novartis?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">VAS NARASIMBAN:</span> Yeah, look, this is one of the most exciting medicines that we've had readout on this year. And what we were able to show with this medicine is we have the potential to delay the onset or maybe stop the onset of breast cancer in patients with early breast cancer who are at risk of recurrence. And this is really important because this is the largest segment within the breast cancer market important-- most importantly for these patients.",
			"And it gives us an opportunity to take a multi-billion dollar medicine outlook today for Kisqali and add another multibillion dollar indication on top. And that really helps us underpin this mid-term growth that we've-- guidance we've given of 4% growth and 40% core margin. So Kisqali will be one pillar. And we some other drug readouts I'm sure we'll talk about. But I think it really just shows that that innovation engine is really starting to hit for us.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">ANJALEE KHEMLANI:</span> First of all, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. I had to throw that in there. Let's talk about your company pipeline. I know that you pulled back. You're starting to focus on five core areas.",
			"And I feel like this is part of a trend we're seeing in pharma right now, which is looking at being more efficient. You're seeing spinoffs of generics, which Novartis is doing, and then spinoffs of consumer health as well. Talk to me about why this is happening right now.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">VAS NARASIMBAN:</span> When you think about the strategy in a big pharma company like-- like ours, as the science moves as fast as it's moving with all of the new technologies like cell and gene therapies or RNA technologies or areas that we're in like radioligand therapy, you have to ask yourself, can you allocate capital to be a leader in these high-tech areas while also holding very different businesses? And I think our conclusion is it's hard to do that. And if you really want to be a leader at the cutting edge in science, you have to focus the company around that.",
			"So really, over the last 10 years but accelerating since I became CEO, we've completely focused Novartis from being a broad conglomerate-- we had seven divisions. We were in animal health, contact lenses, consumer health-- and now we're just focusing on high-end, innovative medicines. Our goal is to regularly develop them, launch them well, and then hopefully get them to countries, patients all around the world. We market these drugs in over 100 countries.",
			"But I think it's that science that's driving the focus. And so-- and then within, it's even hard within the world of pharmaceuticals. You have to focus on a few therapeutic areas. Hard to be good at everything from women's health to cancer to cardiovascular disease. So we've picked five, and we're really focusing down, and that's why we trimmed the pipeline.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRAD SMITH:</span> How has that changed how you earmark capital for everything from research and development all the way into where you might look to acquire in the future too?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">VAS NARASIMBAN:</span> Yeah, absolutely. I mean, when you think of just a few years ago when I started in this role, we had to allocate capital into everything from consumer health to eye care lenses and devices alongside pharmaceuticals. Now we focus all of the company's capital in building a leading pipeline and building that business. And from a B&amp;L, M&amp;A standpoint, it also allows us to focus primarily on bolt-on biotechs. And that's, really, where we've been active.",
			"Over the years, every year or two, we've done a couple of these acquisitions. And of course, we're looking now-- you've probably talked on the show, I'm sure, the XBI is at a really periodic low. So there's a lot of interesting companies. But the key is does the science support the valuation? And if that science supports the valuation, we're certainly willing to make the acquisition.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JULIE HYMAN:</span> And as you said, you're seeing maybe some cheap stuff out there to add in those five focus areas that you spoke about. When you look at the science that's out there right now, where do you think there is the most excitement? Where are we-- I mean, obviously, all the excitement over the past couple of years has been over mRNA and vaccines, et cetera.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">VAS NARASIMBAN:</span> Sure.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JULIE HYMAN:</span> What's happening in your focus areas that you're really excited about?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">VAS NARASIMBAN:</span> I think a couple of things. One, we continue to be excited on what we call these next technology platforms, advanced technology platforms. We believe we're the world leader in cell and gene therapies. So certainly, our acquisition of gene-- of AveXis a few years ago, a drug called Zolgensma, has been really pivotal in our building cell and gene therapies. We're a leader in RNA therapeutics. And so we think RNA therapeutics will continue to be a really important part of the market.",
			"And then looking forward, we have this whole new area of cancer that we're pioneering called radioligand therapy. We have a great new prostate cancer drug Pluvicto, which has had so much demand we just can't keep up with the demand for the medicine. So I think continuing to build out in these technology areas is a big focus for us on our BD&amp;L and M&amp;A.",
			"And then more broadly, it's interesting. Cancer is the hottest area still. You see the most biotechs in cancer. But it's also the hardest area. I think where investors always have to remember is that it has the lowest success rate of any therapeutic area.",
			"So when you bring a cancer drug into phase I, it has the lowest success rate versus any other therapeutic area that you bring a medicine forward. So you have to make the bets. We also have to be aware that it probably won't work.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">ANJALEE KHEMLANI:</span> Speaking of that, getting to this more focused pipeline, you also sit on the chair of PhRMA. And so looking at it from the broader perspective, industry perspective, you have got the Inflation Reduction Act and the pressure that it's putting on the industry, also in the EU, the new patent proposal. So there's a lot going on. How much of an impact is that all having?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">VAS NARASIMBAN:</span> I think it's going to shape how we make investment decisions in the future if we don't fix some of the policy problems I think the IRA created. The biggest issue on our mind, and I think the industry overall, is the distortion created by having biologics protected from price setting for 13 years but small molecule drugs, so pills and other drugs which are much simpler to make, only protected for nine. And what that's going to do over time is shift capital away from these medicines. Important things to note about that. There are many diseases you can only treat with small molecule drugs.",
			"Second, many of the most-- things that we're most excited about, like Kisqali, cancer drugs, you need more than nine years to actually be able to take that medicine and study it in all of the patient populations that are going to benefit. If the government price sets early, you destroy that market. We won't invest in learning about where these medicines can help more patients. So I think it's a big challenge. We're really focused. I'm hopeful, by 2025 when this all gets implemented or supposed to be implemented, we can fix that nine and 13 distortion.",
			"The other big topic in Washington is pharmacy benefit manager reform. There are multiple efforts ongoing. We're highly hopeful as an industry that sector also gets reformed. We think it creates all kinds of distortions for patients where patients are not getting the medicines at the pharmacy counter at the price that we're selling it to the pharmacy benefit manager. They're getting it at these inflated prices where they're not benefiting from the rebates that we pay through.",
			"Lastly, I'd say in Europe, it's really important that the European governments really understand they have to create the right innovation ecosystem. And if they erode patent protections in even small ways, it just erodes the ability for us to invest in that region. And that's what we're really trying to educate those policymakers on.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JULIE HYMAN:</span> I sort of have a related question to the middle part of that about pharmacy benefit managers. And this is also related to the changing face of the health care industry. You talk about the more focus for Novartis.",
			"On the other side among your customer base, there's more consolidation. So you talk about UnitedHealth Optum. You talk about Amazon buying clinics, et cetera. What does that do in terms of customers that you're selling to? Is it a tougher negotiation process? How is that changing your business?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">VAS NARASIMBAN:</span> You're absolutely right, Julie. Over the last decade, that consolidation has led to a lot of buying power from those pharmacy benefit managers, who are largely integrated with the insurers and their ability then to extract these very large rebates. I mean, if you look at in general in our industry, most companies are paying half of their gross sales into rebates.",
			"And that's because of the power of these relatively small number of entities, which is controlling how patients get diagnosed and how they get their medicines. So it's a concern. And I think the real question that I'm hoping Congress will tackle is to take that money and give it to patients or give it to plans and not have it only be driving up the profits of those organizations.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">ANJALEE KHEMLANI:</span> Well, let's talk about that, too, because you also have these smaller players like Cost Plus and those discounts players in the background also trying to negotiate directly, bragging about the ability to even get brands at lower prices. What is the whole market looking like right now in terms of these new players and the actual impact they can have for customers?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">VAS NARASIMBAN:</span> You know, I think it's really good that all this innovation is happening, which I would say, broadly speaking, is trying to bring more transparency into the system so patients can understand where can they get their prescription filled in the most cost effective way, which actually, from our perspective, makes total sense because our goal is that patients fill their prescriptions.",
			"And all of the barriers that are created, whether it's co-pays, whether it's step edits, all of the things that-- I won't bore you with all of the ways, the lingo-- but, I mean, this creates a real barrier. I mean, we know that less than half of patients really fill their prescriptions on an ongoing basis because of all of these barriers. So I'm hopeful these startups can help and can help us improve how the whole system works. The biggest challenge for them is they've got to get to scale. Back to Julie's point, I mean, the other players are so big that you'll easily get squeezed out of the market if you don't get to scale quickly.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JULIE HYMAN:</span> And we talked about this a little bit back in January when we spoke at Davos about recession and the effect or not on a company like Novartis because many of your medicines are necessary for people to have. But what you just said points to the idea that even if they are necessary, some people are not filling their prescriptions. They're not paying their co-pays or, if they don't have insurance, they're not spending on those. So what are you seeing in your customer base that reflects that?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">VAS NARASIMBAN:</span> So, first, I always think of our Davos meeting because you took a picture of my shoe, I think, didn't you?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JULIE HYMAN:</span> Yes, I did. I do remember taking pictures of people's shoes, yes.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">VAS NARASIMBAN:</span> It's very memorable. I get-- do a lot of interviews, but I remember--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JULIE HYMAN:</span> Good. Good.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">VAS NARASIMBAN:</span> --I remembered the Yahoo one. You know, I think-- I think on this point, the key is that we have to increase affordability at the pharmacy counter. And I actually do think one of the positives of the IRA legislation we discussed earlier is that we have co-pays capped now. And when that gets implemented in 2025, it's going to be really interesting to see when Medicare patients have their co-pays capped at $2,000 a year, now do we see prescriptions getting filled because they should. I mean, they should be getting filled if that's the barrier.",
			"And that's going to lead to a big shift. I mean, we're hopeful that means in areas like heart disease and cancer and immunology disease that people will then get on our medicines and stay on our medicines over time. So that'll be a really, really big positive because I think what happens is once you hit the current system, once you get past a certain point, the out-of-pocket costs are just simply too high. So that's going to be a really important moment in our industry when that happens.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JULIE HYMAN:</span> All right, well, we'll keep in touch then. Vas, I won't be taking pictures of your shoes this time.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">VAS NARASIMBAN:</span> All right.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JULIE HYMAN:</span> It's a little different. We're not out on the icy tundra like we were there. Vas Narasimhan, Novartis CEO, and our Anjalee Khemlani. Thanks so much. Great to see--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">VAS NARASIMBAN:</span> Yeah, great to see you all.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JULIE HYMAN:</span> --you in person once again.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">VAS NARASIMBAN:</span> Thank you, all."

			"We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.",

			"After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.",

Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.",
			"The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.",

The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

			"This renowned provider of a diversified line of healthcare products has a market capitalization of $192.9 billion.

			"Let’s delve deeper.",
			"<strong>Q1 Upsides: </strong>Abbott exited the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing increased 10%, led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals and Nutrition. Within EPD, sales increased 11% in the quarter. The upside can be attributed to strong performance in Brazil, China and Southeast Asia and across several therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic, gastroenterology, CNS and pain management. EPD successfully continued with its double-digit sales growth momentum for the last two years.",
			"<strong>Core Diagnostics Grow Strong:</strong> Excluding COVID-testing sales, organic sales growth was led by mid to high single-digit growth in Core Lab, Rapid and Point of Care Diagnostics. In Core Lab Diagnostics, growth was led by strong performance in the United States and Europe, which was partially offset by soft market conditions in China early in the year. However, China is showing improved market demand over the last several weeks. Excluding China, Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales increased nearly 8% globally in the first quarter.",

		"provider": "Simply Wall St.",

		"content": [
			"Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We note that <strong>CVS Health Corporation</strong> (<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:NYSE:CVS;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nyse-cvs/cvs-health?blueprint=2501554&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=intro&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NYSE:CVS</a>) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?",
			"Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.",
			"<span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Check out our latest analysis for CVS Health;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nyse-cvs/cvs-health?blueprint=2501554&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for CVS Health </a></span>",
			"As you can see below, CVS Health had US$58.2b of debt, at March 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, it does have US$17.7b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$40.5b.",
			"The latest balance sheet data shows that CVS Health had liabilities of US$75.1b due within a year, and liabilities of US$92.7b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$17.7b in cash and US$28.3b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$121.7b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.",
			"Given this deficit is actually higher than the company's massive market capitalization of US$89.3b, we think shareholders really should watch CVS Health's debt levels, like a parent watching their child ride a bike for the first time. In the scenario where the company had to clean up its balance sheet quickly, it seems likely shareholders would suffer extensive dilution.",
			"We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).",
			"We'd say that CVS Health's moderate net debt to EBITDA ratio ( being 2.1), indicates prudence when it comes to debt. And its strong interest cover of 11.6 times, makes us even more comfortable. We saw CVS Health grow its EBIT by 2.4% in the last twelve months. That's far from incredible but it is a good thing, when it comes to paying off debt. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if CVS Health can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:this free report on analyst profit forecasts;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nyse-cvs/cvs-health/future?blueprint=2501554&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=integrated-pitch&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this free report on analyst profit forecasts</a> to be interesting.",
			"But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Over the last three years, CVS Health actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. That sort of strong cash conversion gets us as excited as the crowd when the beat drops at a Daft Punk concert.",
			"CVS Health's conversion of EBIT to free cash flow was a real positive on this analysis, as was its interest cover. In contrast, our confidence was undermined by its apparent struggle to handle its total liabilities. We would also note that Healthcare industry companies like CVS Health commonly do use debt without problems. Looking at all this data makes us feel a little cautious about CVS Health's debt levels. While debt does have its upside in higher potential returns, we think shareholders should definitely consider how debt levels might make the stock more risky. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For instance, we've identified <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:3 warning signs for CVS Health;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nyse-cvs/cvs-health?blueprint=2501554&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=integrated-pitch&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> 3 warning signs for CVS Health</strong> </a> that you should be aware of.",

			"We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.",
			"Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:",
			"<i>(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)</i><br/><strong>Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF)</strong> = US$72b",
			"After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.8%.",
			"<strong>Terminal Value (TV)</strong>= FCF<sub>2032</sub> × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$14b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.8%– 2.1%) = US$251b",
			"<strong>Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)</strong>= TV / (1 + r)<sup>10</sup>= US$251b÷ ( 1 + 7.8%)<sup>10</sup>= US$119b",
			"The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$190b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$239, the company appears about fair value at a 7.3% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.",
			"We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Danaher as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.952. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.",

			"<strong>Opportunity</strong>",

			"Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Danaher, we've compiled three important aspects you should further research:",

Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.",
			"No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.",

			"Socially responsible investing is quickly becoming a norm rather than an exception as more and more people understand the importance of taking into account social conscience when making investment decisions. <a class=\"link yahoo-link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Socially responsible investing;elm:context_link;itc:0;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-best-ethical-companies-invest-181936013.html\">Socially responsible investing</a> includes investing in companies that adhere to ethical or socially conscious business practices or steer clear of businesses or actions that harm the society according to many, including tobacco, alcohol, gambling, weapons, carbon emissions, child labor, etc. Socially responsible investing, ESG investing and impact investing have all seen a huge rise in popularity over the past few years.",
			"According to estimates from Bloomberg Intelligence, assets in the ESG space were expected to reach $41 trillion by the end of 2022. Historically, Europe has been at the forefront of ESG policy making and ESG investing but the Bloomberg report said that the US is now leading the investments in the ESG space.",
			"One of the most important trends seen in the socially responsible investing or ESG investing circles is the rise of ETFs and mutual funds. These give individual investors an easy and cost-effective way to have exposure to socially responsible companies. As an individual investors it’s difficult to find which companies are sticking to socially responsible business practices and ESG goals. So why not leave this legwork to the experts and just put your money into an ETF or mutual fund that is focused on finding such companies? The Bloomberg report cited data from Morningstar, which says that money held in ESG ETFs and sustainable mutual funds worldwide jumped 53% in 2021 to reach $2.7 trillion.",
			"As investors grow socially conscious, hedge funds are also upping their activism in the space and many companies are facing heat from ESG-focused hedge funds that are forcing companies to get their act together and stick to environment-friendly business practices. For example, environment-focused fund Engine No. 1 in 2021 managed to defeat oil giant ExxonMobil and installed its two members on the company’s board. The fund, which was not popular until this victory, received support from some of the biggest institutional investors of ExxonMobil, including BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. This shows the massive change ESG investing is ushering in at the Wall Street and how many investment firms and companies either willingly or unwillingly have to give in to this pressure.",
			"Engine No.1 in a scathing <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:letter;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://reenergizexom.com/materials/letter-to-the-board-of-directors-february-22\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">letter</a> to ExxonMobil’s board of directors criticized the company’s lack of adherence to its goals and targets related to climate. Here’s what the historic letter said:",
			"But not all is good and rosy for the ESG investing world. ESG investors and climate activist funds are facing a backlash from some circles and ESG funds also saw a huge exodus of investors amid losses and tough macro backdrop.",
			"For example, the iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF assets have dropped to $13.8 billion from $25 billion recorded a year ago, according to a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Bloomberg report;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-30/why-esg-in-america-may-face-a-rough-road-ahead-this-year?leadSource=uverify%20wall\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg report</a>. The report said that as of March 2023, global assets of ESG ETFs were about $471 billion, as compared to $486 billion recorded in January. The report said that investors pulled a whopping $4.4 billion in a single week in March.",
			"The report also said the industry was facing a “concentration” problem, in which a handful of major funds were invested in the ESG space and when a single major fund decides to pull money from a fund, the overall industry sees a decline.",
			"Some investors are also getting frustrated with what they believe an overemphasis on environment in the ESG spectrum. Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones, who is the cofounder of  Just Capital, believes worker treatment should be the center of the ESG equation and not the environment.",

			"<b>WALTHAM, Mass., May 09, 2023</b>--(<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:BUSINESS WIRE;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.businesswire.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)--Pfizer and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE: TMO) today announced they have entered into a collaboration agreement to help increase local access to next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based testing for lung and breast cancer patients in more than 30 countries across Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia where advanced genomic testing has previously been limited or unavailable. Access to local NGS testing can help to provide faster analysis of associated genes, empowering healthcare providers to select the right therapy for that individual patient.<i><sup>1</sup></i>",

			"Cancer is a leading cause of death globally, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020, or around one in six deaths. Breast and lung cancer are the leading types of cancer diagnosed and are responsible for almost 4.5 million deaths worldwide.<sup>2</sup> By 2040, the global burden for cancer is expected to grow to 27.5 million new cancer cases and 16.3 million cancer deaths.<sup>3</sup> Under the agreement, Thermo Fisher will identify local labs that will be using the company's NGS technology and ensure they have the necessary infrastructure, trained staff, and quality control measures to meet industry standards for NGS testing services for breast and lung cancer. Pfizer will explore ways to enable affordable patient access for NGS testing for these types of cancer and work to raise healthcare provider awareness regarding the benefits of advanced testing. The two companies will continue to evaluate opportunities to expand geographically and to expand testing for other types of cancer.",
			"\"Anyone facing a cancer diagnosis should have access to cutting-edge testing that can match them with an appropriate, optimized treatment plan and better inform their care. Today, we aim to bring rapid NGS testing to an increased number of decentralized labs, closer to where patients are treated,\" said Gianluca Pettiti, executive vice president at Thermo Fisher Scientific. \"We are moving one step closer to delivering precision insights to underserved patients so they can receive a more tailored path for their care no matter where they are in the world.\"",
			"\"The more we understand the complex science behind cancer, the better we can treat it. Our experience has taught us that cancer cannot always be treated with a broad brush and often requires an individualized approach based on precise disease characteristics,\" said Nick Lagunowich, Pfizer Global President of Emerging Markets. \"In many parts of the world, access to next-generation sequencing may be limited or unaffordable for cancer patients. This program aims to improve their treatment journey and help increase their chances for improved outcomes.\"",
			"Single gene testing has historically been used to match patients with appropriate targeted therapies. However, this can be a time intensive process if sequential tests are needed and there may not be enough tissue to run every test – which may require additional biopsy procedures. As more targeted therapies are available that can be matched through a broader set of genomic markers, next-generation sequencing is quickly replacing sequential, single biomarker tests. By screening a single tumor tissue or blood sample for multiple biomarkers simultaneously, NGS can provide clinical teams with rapid and actionable genomic insights to help inform precision oncology treatment decisions for eligible patients.<sup>4</sup>",
			"A retrospective observational real-world data study looked at newly diagnosed stage IV non-small cell lung cancer patients, and found outcomes such as apparent survival and time to next treatment were significantly compromised if actionable mutations were identified after systemic treatment was initiated (e.g. chemotherapy and immunotherapy). However, when treatment was initiated based on molecular results, patients experienced better outcomes compared to patients who were treated prior to receiving molecular results, supporting the need for rapid molecular testing to inform better treatment decisions.<sup>5</sup>",

			"Wall Street is caught in feeble trading triggered by an uncertain Fed policy, growing geopolitical tensions and recession fears. This has compelled investors to look for safe and defensive bets, thus raising the appeal for dividend investing. In fact, applying some smart-beta strategies to the dividend investing world could fetch higher returns.",
			"This is because the strategy helps to capture market inefficiencies in a transparent way by adding extra metrics like volatility, revenues, earnings, momentum and other fundamental factors to the market cap or rules-based indices. And nothing seems better than picking the dividend growth strategy.",
			"We have selected five dividend growth stocks — <strong>PulteGroup Inc.</strong>, <strong>Novartis</strong>, <strong>Boyd Gaming Corp.</strong>, <strong>Cummins</strong> and <strong>W.W. Grainger Inc.</strong> — that could be solid choices for your portfolio.",
			"Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.",
			"Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.",
			"Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.",
			"As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.",
			"Here are five of the 20 stocks that fit the bill:",
			"Atlanta-based <strong>PulteGroup</strong> is engaged in homebuilding and financial services businesses, primarily in the United States.

			"<span class=\"legendSpanClass\"><span class=\"xn-location\">MONTREAL</span></span>, <span class=\"legendSpanClass\"><span class=\"xn-chron\">May 9, 2023</span></span> /CNW/ - AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), today announced that Health Canada has approved RINVOQ<b><sup>®</sup></b> (upadacitinib, 15 mg), the first oral, once-daily selective and reversible JAK inhibitor for the treatment of adults with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) with objective signs of inflammation who have had an inadequate response to a biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) or when use of those therapies is inadvisable.",
			"This indication follows the <span class=\"xn-chron\">July 2022</span> Health Canada approval of RINVOQ for adults with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who have had an inadequate response to a biologic DMARD or when use of those therapies is inadvisable, making RINVOQ the first and only JAK inhibitor approved for the full spectrum of axial spondyloarthritis.<i><sup>2</sup></i>",
			"Nr-axSpA is a chronic, progressive inflammatory rheumatic disease that causes joint inflammation leading to back pain and stiffness.<sup>4</sup> It cannot be detected by x-ray, which makes it extremely difficult to diagnose.<sup>5</sup> Nr-axSpA and AS are considered as two sub-types of a broader condition called axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). A recent multi-country study reported that approximately 16 percent of patients with nr-axSpA will progress to AS after five years.<sup>6</sup>",
			"\"Non-radiographic axial SpA is a very complex disease that is difficult to diagnose. And yet early detection and treatment are critical to improving health outcomes,\" explained Dr. <span class=\"xn-person\">Denis Choquette</span>, Rheumatologist at the Institut de Rhumatologie de Montréal and Scientific Director, Rhumadata. \"This new indication for RINVOQ is a significant milestone for rheumatologists and patients. AxSpA is typically diagnosed in young people under 45 years old, so it is very encouraging to now have a new, oral therapeutic choice for patients.\"",
			"\"Today, as a patient, but also as Chair of the Canadian Spondyloarthritis Association, I can say that we are thrilled to learn that RINVOQ is now approved for the treatment of adults with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis. When I first started experiencing symptoms of nr-axSpA, I thought I had a back sprain from playing sports. That first flare went on for three months. Over time, I also experienced inflammatory flares in my ankles, neck, and shoulders. By age 33, I felt like an old man. Getting my diagnosis was difficult as I didn't have the typical AS inflammatory markers; my x-rays came back negative. Two years after the onset of pain, I was prescribed an MRI centered on the sacroiliac joints, which confirmed that I had nr-axSpA. My story is truly ironic because I was a doctor specializing in the musculoskeletal field, working with other experts, and we all missed my diagnosis for years. And yet comparatively, I was lucky; it takes, on average, seven to ten years for people to be diagnosed with this disease. As AS warriors, we can become resistant to medications with time and so access to new innovative medicines is crucial. My hope is that RINVOQ's approval is followed by timely and equitable access for all patients. This access is essential for people living with this painful and debilitating condition,\" said Dr. Élie Karam, Chair, Canadian Spondylitis Association.",
			"This approval is supported by data from the Phase 3 SELECT-AXIS 2 clinical trial (Study 2), which evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of upadacitinib in patients with nr-axSpA.<i><sup>ii</sup> </i>Study results show RINVOQ delivered rapid and meaningful disease control with nearly half of patients achieving the primary endpoint of ASAS40* versus placebo, as well as significant improvement in signs and symptoms of nr-axSpA at week 14.<i><sup>1 </sup></i>",
			"<i>*ASAS40 is a composite index that measures disease activity.<sup>1</sup> To achieve an ASAS40 response, a patient's disease activity must have improved by at least 40%, as well as improved by two units (on a 0 to 10 scale) in at least three of four disease areas assessed, and the remaining area must not have gotten worse, including back pain, patient global assessment of disease activity, physical function, and morning stiffness.<sup>1</sup></i>",
			"\"For nearly a quarter century, AbbVie has been dedicated to discovering and delivering innovative therapies for people living with rheumatic diseases,\" added <span class=\"xn-person\">Tracey Ramsay</span>, Vice President and General Manager, AbbVie Canada. \"The needs and experiences of patients drive our relentless pursuit to improve the standards of care, which is why we are proud to now offer Canadians the first once-daily oral advanced therapy that works across the spectrum of axial spondyloarthritis.\"",
			"<b>About the SELECT-AXIS 2 trial program </b><sup><i><b>7</b></i></sup>",
			"SELECT-AXIS 2 was conducted as a master study protocol that contains two standalone studies with randomization, data collection, analysis and reporting conducted independently. The Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies are evaluating the efficacy and safety of RINVOQ compared with placebo on reduction of signs and symptoms in adult participants with active axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), including bDMARD-IR AS (Study 1) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) (Study 2).

			"<b>New Analysis from the Phase 3 LUCENT-1 and LUCENT-2 Studies in Adults with UC<br/></b>In this new analysis, remission of key symptoms of UC, including bowel urgency, was associated with significant improvement in IBDQ total scores among adults treated with mirikizumab.

			"<strong>Ugur Sahin</strong>",
			"Thank you, Victoria. Good morning, and good afternoon, and warm welcome to all the call participants. We appreciate your continued support. Today, I will summarize our first quarter 2023 highlights and priorities before I pass the call over to my team to provide further details.<br/>Let me reiterate our strategic goals for 2023 and highlight our first quarter and recent achievements. First, to expand and sustain our leadership in COVID-19 with Pfizer by advancing our next-generation vaccine candidate, developing combination vaccines and advancing key Comirnaty features. This quarter, we maintained our strong COVID-19 vaccine market position, supported by key label expansions in regions around the world. <br/>This month, we published preclinical data in the [Journal] Cell on our next-generation Pfizer's (inaudible) vaccine component in combination with Comirnaty.<br/>Our second goal is to accelerate our oncology pipeline and initiate multiple potentially registrational trials. Our new collaborations with DualityBio and OncoC4 complement our pipeline with multiple mid- to late-stage clinical programs that will help us to achieve this goal in the near term. <br/>Our third and final strategic goal is to initiate and accelerate clinical programs with high unmet medical need in infectious diseases. In the first quarter, we initiated new clinical vaccine programs namely for shingles and tuberculosis. The first quarter was a strong start to 2023. We plan to continue execution against these strategic goals to continue our development into a fully integrated global multiproduct biotechnology company addressing divesting medical needs worldwide. <br/>Cancer remains one of the key unmet medical needs. Our long-term oncology strategy is to expand the treatment options available for cancer patients and become a multiproduct company in the next year. In order to best serve the needs of tumor patients, we aim to address the full continuum of cancer treatment, bring novel therapies to market for patients with adjuvant and late-stage cancer and combining our platforms and programs to translate our science into survival. <br/>Key elements in our oncology pipeline are mRNA cancer vaccines, cell therapies, next-generation checkpoint immune modulators and antibody drug conjugate. We believe that these 5 classes has the potential to drive improved outcomes for solid tumor patients across multiple lines of treatment and tumor types.<br/>Our most advanced oncology assets are currently in development for a range of solid tumors at all stage of treatment. We believe that this asset has first-in-class or best-in-class potential and may enable us to drive meaningful change in the treatment of many cancers. <br/>How are we planning to achieve this? Our technology-agnostic innovation engine leverages modular technology platforms, both developed internally and accessed via collaboration partnerships, to produce novel product candidates. <br/>In the first quarter, we announced 2 new collaborations to give us access to assets and platforms that we believe may be important in how solid tumors are treated in the future. One of those, which I'm particularly excited about is the new collaboration with Duality Biologics, the company focused on the discovery and development of next-generation antibody drug conjugates. <br/>In the last few years, advancements in ADC technology has resulted in a potent use for the treatment of solid tumors. We believe that ADCs have the potential to replace highly toxic chemotherapy regimens as the cytotoxic backbone to cancer treatment. ADCs consists of 3 main components: Antibody, Linker and Payload, each of these components has an impact on ADC's pharmacological and clinical properties. ADC is a precision medicine, allowing for targeted graft delivery, particularly to tumor cells with high specificity and potent induced cell death with the benefit of reduced off-target events. <br/>When the monoclonal antibody binds to the target antigen specifically expressed on the tumor cell, the ADC is internalized, allowing for the release of the cytotoxin, which leads to cell death. <br/>Slide 11. Under the terms of the exclusive worldwide licensing collaboration agreement with DualityBio, excluding Mainland China, Hong Kong region and Macau region, we will gain access to 2 programs: DB-1303 targeting HER2 and DB-1311 driven by Duality Biotech platform and novel, cleavable, linker and payload technologies, this third-generation ADCs have demonstrated pharmacokinetic properties that may contribute to an increased third-party window compared to other ADC platforms. ADCs offer a bold combination potential, especially with various IO agents. <br/>A Phase I/II clinical trial for DB-1303 is ongoing, which we plan to expand into further tumor indications, and we aim to rapidly advance clinical development of this program. <br/>Slide 12. I want to end where I started, our vision. With our new collaboration, we now have 27 programs. We plan to start multiple potentially registrational trials in the coming years. Within the next years, we aim to become a multiproduct global biotechnology leader, aiming to contribute and address the world's most pressing health challenges with pioneering disruptive technologies delivered at scale. <br/>With that, I would like to thank you all for your confidence in our success and your continued support. I will now turn the call over to Özlem.",

			"Thank you, Ugur. I'm delighted to speak with everyone today and provide our pipeline update. <br/>Starting on Slide 14. Not only since BioNTech's founding, we have firmly believed in the potential for mRNA cancer vaccines to have a place in the future of cancer treatment. We have built our personalized and off the shelf platforms and initiated a broad clinical program to evaluate the full utility of our approaches. <br/>Today, we have a broad cancer vaccine's development program with 4 ongoing randomized Phase II clinical trials in both the adjuvant and metastatic disease settings. The iNeST program includes 4 clinical studies, the Phase II clinical trial with autogene cevumeran, BNT122 monotherapy in adjuvant CRC started in 2020 and is recruiting patients with CTDNA positive the resected Stage 2 high-risk and Stage 3 colorectal cancer. <br/>Data from an investigator initiated Phase I clinical trials evaluating BNT122, autogene cevumeran, and onetime dosing of atezolizumab in adjuvant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were presented at ASCO last year. A Phase II clinical trial in this patient population is planned to start in 2023. A randomized Phase II clinical trial evaluating our agent in combination with pembrolizumab in first-line melanoma patients has finished enrollment. Analysis of PFS as primary endpoint will be triggered event-based. <br/>Data from a Phase I clinical trial with BNT122 autogene cevumeran, a single agent and in combination with atezolizumab in patients with locally advanced disease and metastatic disease across multiple tumor types, was presented previously. We are preparing a manuscript summarizing the Phase I data for publication. <br/>In our FixVac program that is comprised of 4 different indication-specific product candidates, we have ongoing clinical studies. We have a first-in-human Phase I/II clinical trial, evaluating BNT112 monotherapy and in combination with cemiplimab in 2 cohorts of patients, namely with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and with high-risk localized prostate cancer, who are eligible for treatment with androgen-deprivation therapy is ongoing. <br/>A randomized Phase II clinical trials evaluating BNT113 in combination with pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab monotherapy as a first-line treatment in patients with PD-L1 positive unresectable recurrent or metastatic HPV-16 positive head, neck squamous cell carcinoma is ongoing. <br/>A randomized Phase II clinical trial evaluating BNT111 in combination with cemiplimab, whereas both agents as monotherapy in patients with refractory/relapsed unresectable Stage 3 or 4 melanoma is ongoing, conducted in collaboration with Regeneron. Data from the first-in-human open-label Phase I clinical trial evaluating BNT111 in patients with advanced melanoma have been published and presented. <br/>A Phase I basket clinical trial evaluating BNT116 alone and in combination with cemiplimab in patients with non-small cell lung cancer in various settings is ongoing. For example, patients, who have progressed on prior PD-1 inhibitor treatment or are not eligible for chemotherapy, and in combination with the docetaxel in patients, who have received prior platinum-based chemotherapy. <br/>The second trial is planned to start this year to evaluate the combination of BNT116 and cemiplimab and cemiplimab alone as first-line treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. <br/>Based on the data collected from these trials, we plan to continue the clinical trial advancement and expansion of both our mRNA cancer vaccine program. <br/>I'd like to put our first quarter pipeline advancements and additions into the broader context of our clinical stage pipeline, which is depicted on Slide 15. In the first quarter, we added to our pipeline the new assets. Ugur already mentioned. The HER2 targeting ADC, DB-1303 developed by our colleagues at DualityBio, which has recently started the Phase II portion of the ongoing Phase I/II clinical trial. <br/>Also in the first quarter, we added ONC-392 to our pipeline, the PH sensitive anti-CTLA4 antibody developed by our partner, OncoC4. ONC-392 is being tested in 2 ongoing clinical trials, the first in [multiple solid tumors] as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab; and the second trial in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients in combination with pembrolizumab. We are excited about accelerating and broadening the clinical development for both of these programs based on the data we've seen in the pre-clinic and clinic. <br/>On Slide 16, I want to briefly highlight the mechanism of action and clinical data of ONC-392. CTLA-4 recycles continuously between the cell surface and the endosomes as it does not undergo lysosomal degradation. Interruption of this process is associated with the development of autoimmunity. Autoimmunity and immune-related adverse events are a major limitation of approved anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, such as ipilimumab that disrupts CTLA-4 recycling by promoting lysosomal degradation of this important immune checkpoint modulators.<br/>ONC-392 does not interpret with the recycling it dissociates from the CTLA-4 molecule in the endosome and allows normal recycling of both the antibody and the CTLA-4 molecule, and thus is designed for stronger cancer furopoletic effect and less immune-related adverse effects. ONC-392 is being tested in the trial that investigated dose escalation, a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab. Multiple indications, such as [IO] and resistant non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma are being treated with RP2D. Preliminary data shows that ONC-392 is well tolerated with no DLTs, and the RP2D was determined to be 10 mg/kg without MTDs being reached. <br/>Severe immune-related grade-free adverse event rate in the combo dose escalation was 23%, which is considered lower than what was reported for comparable IO/IO combination. The RP2D dose for combination is 6 mg/kg. In summary, ONC-392 dose as monotherapy or in combination was well tolerated, and the safety profile appears to allow higher dosing for a longer duration of treatment as compared to ipilimumab. <br/>Early efficacy data as monotherapy in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients and in combination with pembrolizumab in multiple solid tumors were promising. Presentation of the first data from the NSCLC expansion cohort of the Phase I/II PRESERVE-001 study is planned at ASCO next month. <br/>Building on this data, we are planning to start a Phase III clinical trial in non-small cell lung cancer patients without driver mutations, who have progressed following anti-PD-1. After progressing on an anti-PD-1 treatment, non-small cell lung cancer patients have 8 to 11 months median overall survival and 3 to 4.5 months progression-free survival with a response rate of around 10% when treated with the second-line standard of care docetaxel. With ONC-392, we hope to offer a promising new second-line treatment option for these patients. <br/>The randomized open-label controlled multicenter Phase III RESERVE-003 study is planned to treat IO resistant non-small cell lung cancer patients in the dose confirmation part we and OncoC4 plan to assess the efficacy and safety of ONC-392 given at 2 dose levels in comparison to docetaxel. In the subsequent part of the trial, we intend to assess the safety and efficacy of ONC-392 at the collective dose regimen versus docetaxel.<br/>Patients with Stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer, who progressed on prior IO treatment with or without chemotherapy and ECOG status of 0 or 1 can be enrolled via IO-IO therapy is allowed. A total of about 600 patients are planned to be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to receive either ONC-392 or docetaxel in this 2-stage study. The primary endpoint is overall survival with objective response rate, PFS and safety as secondary endpoints. <br/>The study is planned to start enrolling patients within the next few weeks. The trial in progress poster will be presented at the 2023 ASCO Annual Meeting. <br/>Moving to our collaboration with our partner, DualityBio, on Slide 18. As part of the collaboration, we will gain access to DualityBio's lead candidate, DB-1303, a HER2 targeting ADC comprised of the trastuzumab, biosimilar covalently linked to a proprietary DNA topoisomerase-1 inhibitor, P1003 via retrievable linker L101. <br/>Approved ADCs have shown antitumor activity and clinical benefits and multiple types of cancer. While current generations of anti-HER2 ADCs have an improved overall therapeutic index, more efficacious and safer anti-HER2 ADCs, for example, regarding potential lung toxicity, such as the severe life-threatening or fatal interspecial lung disease, including pneumonitis may add further clinical benefit. <br/>The first data for DB-1303 were presented at the t EORTC-NCI-AACR conference last October and describe to significantly improved therapeutic window of DB-1303 preclinically as compared to DS-8201a or TDM-1 analogs to trastuzumab deruxtecan and trastuzumab emtansin, respectively. In [red] monkey and human plasma, DB-1303 demonstrated high drug to antibody ratio and outstanding plasma stability. <br/>In HER2-positive and HER2 negative mixed cell cultures, DB-1303 inhibited the proliferation of both cell types, demonstrating its bi-standard effect. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis of DB-1303 in xenograft mouse models showed targeted delivery of the toxin into tumor tissue. Further in VIVO studies in monkeys showed a superior stability of DB-1303 and rapid systemic clearance of the toxin. These pharmacokinetic properties result in maintenance of efficacy and reduction of systemic toxicity in animal models, which are shown on the next slide. <br/>Slide 19, DB-1303 exhibited potent antitumor activity in both HER2-positive and HER2-low tumor models, potentially expanding the benefit population of HER2-targeted therapy. Preclinical studies in monkeys demonstrated an improved safety profile compared to DS-8201 with the highest non-severely toxic dose of 80 mg/kg. <br/>Further, DB-1303 showed lower risk of causing lung inflammation with no ILD-like lung toxicity. The pharmacokinetic properties of DB-1303 may contribute to a superior safety profile observed in monkeys. <br/>Slide 20. The program has received Fast Track Designation from the FDA and is currently being evaluated in a Phase I/II clinical trial for HER2-positive advanced solid tumors. The study is enrolling pretreated patients with advanced or metastatic HER2-positive or HER2-expressing solid tumors. Data from this study will be presented at ASCO this year. After determination of the recommended Phase II dose, further dose expansion cohorts are planned, including tastuzumab-treated HER2 gastric or the gastric esophageal adenocarcinoma, esophageal carcinoma and CRC. HER2 over-expressing and HER2-low endometrial carcinoma, hormone receptor positive HER2-low breast cancer as well as HER2-positive breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer with activating HER2 mutations. <br/>Slide 21 highlights our infectious disease pipeline. In December of last year, we initiated the first clinical trials, investigating an mRNA-based vaccine for malaria prevention. Consistent with our 2023 strategic priorities, we started first in human clinical trials testing new mRNA vaccine candidates in the first quarter of 2023. One is a vaccine against tuberculosis and the other with our partner, Pfizer, a vaccine for shingles. <br/>These programs built on our validated platform of mRNA-LNPs that have a backbone optimized design and our nucleos got modified to address diseases with a significant global need. The World Health Organization estimates that about 25% of the world population is latently infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium responsible for the tuberculosis disease. 10.6 million people developed active tuberculosis in 2021 and a total of 1.6 million people died of tuberculosis worldwide. <br/>There are limited prophylactic treatment options for tuberculosis and cases of multidrug-resistant mycobacterium tuberculosis strains are increasing worldwide. The only licensed, tuberculosis vaccine, is the mycrobacterium bovis derived and attenuated BCG, which was first introduced in the 1920s and is still routinely administered to newborns in most tuberculosis endemic countries. <br/>While BCG provides time protection from severe forms of tuberculosis in childhood, the high number of pulmonary tuberculosis cases that emerge every year illustrates the limited durability and protective efficacy of BCG against tuberculosis disease and transmission in adolescents and adults. Vaccine technology advances are seen as important to ending the tuberculosis epidemic by 2030, which is the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal. <br/>Given the major global unmet medical need for tuberculosis vaccines, we and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are working on multi-antigen our aided lipid nanoparticle vaccine candidates against tuberculosis. The target population of a BNT164 program will include IGRA-negative and positive BCG naive and vaccinated healthy adults. The clinical program in Germany and South Africa, thereby including a non-endemic and endemic country, will investigate with safety, reactogenicity and tolerability of the BNT164 vaccine candidates. <br/>The Phase I program is intended to have select for optimal mRNA vaccine candidate and the dose level for advancement to Phase II. The vaccine may prevent infection and subsequent transmission, and when applied to a large enough proportion of the target population that constitutes the infectious reservoir, could enable interruption of transmission. And that bring us closer to the elimination of tuberculosis. <br/>We believe that even a vaccine that is only 50% efficacious would be a critical intervention and a success in contributing to the WHO tuberculosis elimination target by 2030. <br/>Slide 23. Dynamic evolution of COVID-19 strain requires care vaccine adaptations and innovative next-generation vaccines. We are pursuing several next-gen vaccine concepts. One of these is a T-cell string vaccine component, aka BNT162b4. As shown on the left-hand side, along the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and particularly pronounced in the omicron sublineages, there has been progressive loss of concert spike protein neutralizing antibody sites. <br/>In contrast, HLA Class 1 and 2 presented T-cell epitopes of the spike protein remained mostly unaltered the process of virus evolution. This is not surprising. Indeed, a fundamental difference of T-cell versus B cell-mediated immunity is that owing to their very nature, T-cell epitopes are less likely to be impacted by mutations. And the T cell-mediated layer of immunity is more robust against immunization. <br/>T-cell response is likely to remain much less impacted than neutralizing antibodies by new variants of concern and may contribute to prevention or limitation of severe COVID-19 manifestation. Based on this rationale, we are developing BNT162b4, an mRNA that encodes variant conserve immunogenic segment of non-spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2, mainly of nuclear captured membrane and ORF1ab proteins was binding to diverse HLA alleles. For design of this strain, we have built on our platforms and skills developed in the context of designing [thematic] mutation-based cancer vaccines. <br/>Our BNT162b4 T-cell strain vaccine component is designed to enhance T-cell immunity and is intended to be combined with variant adapted Comirnaty. We believe we can improve immunity that is variant independent. Our preclinical data was recently published in Cells. In a mouse animal model, we demonstrated that mice immunized with BNT162b2, which is (inaudible) without BNT162b4, which is the T-cell strain non-strong polyfunctional and polyepitopic CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses to the N, M, and ORF1ab proteins of SARS-CoV-2.<br/>Thus broadening the T Cell with (inaudible) beyond the spike protein. <br/>Data from Syrian hamsters that were immunized with BNT162b4 alone or in combination with BNT162b2 and then challenged with [White] SARS-CoV-2 of the delta variants demonstrate that BNT162b4 alone and in combination protects animals from severe disease and enhances viral clearance. The clinical study investigating this next-generation COVID-19 vaccine component candidate in combination with Comirnaty is ongoing. <br/>I look forward to providing additional program updates in the coming months. I will now pass the presentation to our CFO, Jens Holstein, who will present our financial results.",
			"<strong>Jens H. Holstein</strong>",
			"Thank you, Özlem, and a warm welcome to everyone who dialed in today's call. I'll start my section with the key highlights for the first quarter of 2023, which you can find on Slide 26. <br/>The first quarter of 2023 started strong and fully to our expectations. The quarter was driven by seasonal and some carryover effects from the previous year. As an example, we generated revenues from sales in countries with late approvals of our BA.4/ 5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine. For the rest of the year, we are expecting an increase in vaccine sales towards the Northern Hemisphere winter season in the countries which are our key markets. As a consequence, we expect the second quarter to be the weakest quarter in 2023. <br/>Overall, we reiterate our COVID-19 vaccine revenue guidance of around EUR 5 billion for the full 2023 financial year. <br/>I would now like to dive into some key financial figures that underline our successful first quarter. Our total revenues reported for the first quarter of 2023 reached EUR 1.3 billion, mainly related to our share of gross profit from COVID-19 vaccine sales in the collaboration partner territories. These revenues represent a net figure, meaning that we generate a 100% gross margin on those. <br/>As a reminder, under our COVID-19 vaccine collaboration, territories have been allocated between us, Pfizer and Fosun Pharma based on marketing and distribution rights. Please keep in mind that Pfizer's fiscal quarter for subsidiaries outside the United States differs from our financial reporting cycle. Hence, Pfizer's international operations from December 2022 will be reflected in their Q1 2023 earnings, whereas we have included the respective estimate already in our Q4 2022 financial figures. This creates a deviation between the numbers of our partner Pfizer publishers versus our numbers on a quarterly and a full year basis. <br/>With EUR 1.3 billion in revenues, we ended the first quarter with an operating result of EUR 654.4 million and generated earnings per share on a fully diluted basis of EUR 2.05. <br/>With respect to the company's financial position, we ended the first quarter of 2023 with EUR 12.8 billion, comprising EUR 12.1 billion cash and cash equivalents as well as EUR 0.7 billion security investment with a longer time horizon, which we made as part of our investment strategy. <br/>When looking at our cash burn during the first quarter of 2023, the cash movement was negatively impacted, for example, due to a onetime payment settling our wage tax liability incurred in the context of our 2022 share-based payment settlement significant tax prepayments relating to the full financial year of 2023 as well as amounts spent as part of our share repurchase program. <br/>Subsequent to the end of the quarter, in April 2023, we have received approximately EUR 4 billion in cash from our collaboration partner, Pfizer, settling our gross profit share for the fourth quarter of 2022. <br/>Our M&amp;A activities and recent collaboration license agreements announced in the first quarter did not lead to cash outflows during the quarter. In connection with the planned acquisition of InstaDeep and the upfront payments of the collaboration and license agreements with OncoC4 and Duality Biologics, we expect approximately EUR 0.8 billion to be invested in cash and by exchanging shares in the course of 2023. Please note the final InstaDeep purchase price will be determined on closing, and the mentioned amount for M&amp;A does not comprise future earnout and milestone payments. <br/>I'll be moving to our financial results for the first quarter of 2023, as shown on Slide 27. Having explained our revenues on the previous slide, let me move to cost of sales that amounted to EUR 0.1 billion in the first quarter of 2023 compared to EUR 1.3 billion for the comparative prior year period. The drop was mainly due to the decrease in COVID-19 vaccine sales. <br/>Research and development expenses reached EUR 334 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared to EUR 285.8 million for the comparative prior year period. The increase was mainly due to higher expenses incurred from progressing the clinical studies for pipeline candidates. The increase was further driven by an increase in wages, benefits and social security expenses resulting from an increase in headcount. <br/>General and administrative expenses amounted to EUR 119.4 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared to EUR 90.8 million for the comparative prior year period. The increase in G&amp;A was mainly due to increased expenses for IT consulting and IT services as well as an increase in wages, benefits and social security expenses, resulting mainly from an increase in headcount. <br/>Income taxes were accrued with an amount of EUR 205.5 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared to EUR 1.3 billion for the comparative prior year period. The derived effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 was approximately 29%, which is expected to decrease over the 2023 financial year to be in line with our guidance. <br/>For the first quarter of 2023, net profit reached EUR 502.2 million compared to EUR 3.7 billion for the comparative prior year period. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2023 amounted to EUR 2.05 compared to EUR 14.24 for the comparative prior year period. <br/>Now turning to Slide 28. I would like to emphasize that we are reiterating the company's outlook for the 2023 financial year. Please note, the following number reflects current base case projections and are calculated based on the constant currency rate. As stated before, we reiterate our estimated COVID-19 vaccine revenues of around EUR 5 billion for the full 2023 financial year. <br/>Our capital allocation strategy includes a strong investment in M&amp;A transactions to the extent disclosed. They have been, as far as known, reflected in the R&amp;D expenses and will be updated as needed. Overall, we maintain our guidance for client expenses and growth and maintenance CapEx for operating activities as well as the estimated annual effective income tax rate, which we have summarized for you on the slide. <br/>And with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Strategy Officer, Ryan Richardson, for an update on our strategic outlook for 2023 and concluding remarks. Thank you.",
			"<strong>Ryan Richardson</strong>",
			"Thank you, Jens. To wrap up our prepared remarks, I'll provide a brief summary of the commercial outlook for our COVID-19 vaccine franchise before concluding with a few important dates to mark on your calendars.<br/>In 2023, we aim to develop, manufacture and deploy a seasonal adapted Comirnaty vaccine. We expect a recommendation from governmental authorities regarding vaccine strain composition midyear with a potential approval for an adapted vaccine by the end of this summer. Broad vaccination is planned to start early fall. <br/>In addition, we aim to introduce a single-dose, ready-to-use vial, and will continue to improve key Comirnaty features such as shelf stability. In addition, we plan to advance our next-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidates throughout the year. We expect that COVID demand in 2023 will continue to come from a broad range of regions globally. Since the beginning of the first quarter, we have shipped COVID-19 vaccine doses to more than 70 countries and regions. Since the start of the year, our deliveries to middle-income and low-income countries have increased. We have also seen a greater contribution from the pediatric segment so far this year. <br/>For the full year 2023, we expect global demand to be driven by existing signed government contracts, which we anticipate will be augmented by the opening of a commercial market in the U.S. in the second half. In the midterm, we see multiple potential growth drivers for our COVID-19 vaccine franchise. These include the potential for volume growth as the seasonal market is established, particularly in high-risk population segments. <br/>In addition, we believe continued innovation from variant-adapted vaccines, next-generation vaccines and possible respiratory combination vaccines have the potential to support future franchise growth. The transition to private markets in certain regions is likely to take several years. We believe the shift to commercial pricing will provide further midterm growth potential. <br/>We and our partner, Pfizer, believe in the value that our COVID-19 vaccines provide both to individuals and health systems, and we will continue to invest to maintain our leadership position in the market. <br/>The next slide summarizes our pipeline news flow for 2023. Some of these points have been covered, so I won't go through them in detail again here. What is clear is that our pipeline of 27 clinical-stage programs is expected to produce several readouts throughout the year across a range of technologies. We expect data updates for our CAR-T cell program, targeting Claudin-6, our anti-CTLA-4 program and our new HER2 antibody-drug conjugate at ASCO, in addition to multiple further updates for other programs later in the year. <br/>Before concluding and opening up the floor for questions, I would like to reiterate that we will hold our AGM on May 25 and our next innovation series event on November 7. We'll provide further details in the coming weeks on both events. <br/>With that, I'd like to thank our shareholders for their continued support, and I'll conclude our remarks and open up the floor for questions.",

			"(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Tazeen Ahmad from Bank of America.",
			"<strong>Tazeen Ahmad</strong>",
			"I have one on pipeline as it relates to the partnership with Pfizer. On the iNeST program for first-line melanoma, can you give us a sense of when exactly this year that data could be presented, if it's still this year? And what level of data we should expect at the top line? And then I have a follow-up.",
			"<strong>Ryan Richardson</strong>",
			"Yes, sure. Thank you, Tazeen. I'll start and maybe, Ugur, you want to add. So we've retained our guidance for an update in the first-line melanoma setting for this year. And we've also -- we've stated previously, and it's still the case, that our expectation is that the update would speak to both ORR and also PFS.<br/>Ugur, anything you'd like to add?",
			"<strong>Ugur Sahin</strong>",
			"No, that's it.",
			"<strong>Tazeen Ahmad</strong>",
			"Okay. And then as it relates to HER2 with your ADC program, so this is [competitive space] there's multiple candidates that are in development. Can you just talk to us about how you think your program could be differentiated and how you're thinking about the general competitive landscape and what indications could we got served?",
			"<strong>Ugur Sahin</strong>",
			"Yes, maybe I can take this question. So the generation of ADCs, particularly if HER2 provided a massive improvement on existing ADC compounds. We believe that there is still room for improvement, and we also believe that there is room for multiple lines of development, including, for example, HER2 gynecological tumors like ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, HER2-positive non-small cell lung cancer, but even in the breast cancer space, with a compound that comes with a differentiated safety profile. That could add additional safety features and tolerability features. <br/>I would like to mention that we will have a poster at ASCO, which would provide data generated in a larger breast cancer cohort. And that -- and this data could be informative about how this product could be positioned.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And the next question comes from the line of Daina Graybosch, SVB Securities.",
			"<strong>Daina Michelle Graybosch</strong>",
			"I have -- I'll take 2 questions, too. The first one, I wonder if you could talk about the payload in the immunity -- sorry, in the DualityBio programs, and whether you think that this payload will be as synergistic with IO as some of the other payloads that we've seen late-stage clinical trials and how -- whether its synergy is great or less great, how that will impact your development in combination with your other programs? And then I have a follow-up.",
			"<strong>Ugur Sahin</strong>",
			"Yes, Daina, thank you for the excellent question. Actually, you bring up a key point by we are interested in these ADCs. So the payload is based on topoisomerase inhibitor and linker technology is differentiated, providing a more stable linker with even more reduced release of the spontaneous release of the toxin. And yes, the key aspects of bringing in this new compound class is that we believe that these new compounds would be highly synergistic with our IO pipeline, including the next-generation immune modulators and bispecific antibodies as well as our personalized vaccines and fixed back applications.",
			"<strong>Daina Michelle Graybosch</strong>",
			"Great. And then my second question is on the flu vaccine. And I wonder how much degree of freedom there was and is in designing an mRNA-based flu vaccine? And essentially, I'm trying to get at, how similar or different should we expect Pfizer BioNTech vaccine from the Moderna vaccine in its outcome?",
			"<strong>Ugur Sahin</strong>",
			"So there is always flexibility. If you use this mRNA technology, there's a lot of flexibility in having a vaccine with a differentiated profile. As you know, there are challenges in the field of influenza vaccines, particularly if you address the question of influenza A versus B immune responses. Therefore, I believe that the design of these vaccines could provide additional features that can overcome limitations in the field.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And your next question comes from the line of Akash Tewari from Jefferies.",
			"<strong>Unidentified Analyst</strong>",
			"This is Ivy on for Akash. We have 2 actually. First is for COVID. So for your EU government orders, I guess, how many doses have been delivered so far? Because the tracker we follow use to suggest there's around 900 million that has been delivered, but now it's only showing around 700 million BioNTech Pfizer doses delivered, with around like 200 million unknown categories. So I guess, any clarification you can give me will be super helpful. Then I have a follow-up question on your IMS program.",
			"<strong>Jens H. Holstein</strong>",
			"Yes. Yes, thanks for the question. I mean, as you know, we are currently in discussions with the EU regarding the renegotiation of the contract. And given that we're in the middle of these discussions, we don't want to give any details on this. We don't want to put any burden on those discussions. So please bear with us. We expect that we have some more clarity on the discussions in the course of Q2. That's our expectation, and then we're happy to share the results on those negotiations with you, of course.",
			"<strong>Unidentified Analyst</strong>",
			"Got it. So my second question is for BNT122. So for the melanoma data readout this year, I guess you just reiterate that this will be limited to PFS and ORR. Is there any specific reason on why there won't be any OS data? Does that imply a potential longer duration of result?",
			"<strong>Ugur Sahin</strong>",
			"I can take this question. The maturation of the data is -- will most likely not allow to generate OS data.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And your next question comes from the line of Chris Shibutani, Goldman Sachs.",
			"<strong>Chris Shibutani</strong>",
			"Some clarifying questions in terms of how we should think about your results and financials through the year, if I could. The reiteration of the EUR 5 billion of guidance, can you tell us what does that take into account embedded in your base case assumption here, particularly as I recognize that you have the EC contract negotiations are going through? You did mention the second quarter is going to delight us, but then the deliveries, again, in the assumption for the EUR 5 billion through the balance of the year.<br/>Similarly to the financials on the R&amp;D-related expense, you have the outlining of the full year level in the first quarter. It was quite a bit less than we had been expecting, and I believe consensus as well. Help us with the sort of the cadence and the shape of spending through the year. And then I have one other follow-up.",
			"<strong>Jens H. Holstein</strong>",
			"Yes, Chris, happy to take that question, and Ryan will chime in. Maybe starting with the top line guidance. We reiterated the guidance, as I stated in my speech, before we had a good start in Q1. We believe, Q2, and that's not a surprise to you, will be weaker. I mean it's not really the season for vaccinations as we see it for flu. We assume that the development in terms of how people will get vaccinated is comparable to some extent to what we see in flu. So specifically looking at the Northern Hemisphere, so our expectations for Q3 and Q4 is that these will be the 2 quarters of relevance for us for the full year.<br/>We have, of course, seen already before we went out with the guidance that the discussions with the EU will be discussions, where we might have to face, and we stated that when we went out with the guidance that we might have to face some reduction in the total volume for '23 versus what has been negotiated before, that we might have some other implications in some other countries potentially as well, and we try to reflect this accordingly. <br/>I would like to reiterate that if you compare the Pfizer guidance of $13.5 billion, if you take that, I think they're also reflected those discussions and negotiations ongoing. And if you translate that, taking into account the currency implication, taking into account that Pfizer reflects their December revenue figure of 2022 in their Q1 figure, and December 2022 has been a very strong month, we -- whereas we have to reflect this month in our full year figures for 2022, so we have from January to December, our revenue figures were at Pfizer for the international part is just looking at November to November. <br/>So these things caused some differences, quite significant differences in our estimation, if you compare the December 2022 versus our expectation for December 2023. So there is a big impact coming from this. And if you then take this into account, we feel that the EUR 5 billion that we have reiterated today is something that we can live with. It could be that -- and that has been our assumption that there might be a new variant that we will adapt the existing vaccine that we produce. That's our assumption to reach the EUR 5 billion. And we're -- our assumption in that respect remains valid at this point in time. I hope that helps you.",
			"<strong>Ryan Richardson</strong>",
			"And maybe -- I would just add, and maybe you can come back as well to the R&amp;D point.",
			"<strong>Jens H. Holstein</strong>",
			"Yes, I'll come back to the R&amp;D part.",
			"<strong>Ryan Richardson</strong>",
			"Just to add two points to that. So first is actually the volumes, while we're not disclosing volumes in the first quarter, we were shipping to quite a broad range of countries in the first quarter, over 70 countries we mentioned. There's still some carryover there to pandemic contracts. And so as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did see some significant volumes in particular to low and middle income countries in the first quarter.",
			"<strong>Jens H. Holstein</strong>",
			"Yes. And then maybe to add on the R&amp;D costs, Chris, so the first quarter has been relatively light if you see (inaudible) that we have booked for Q1, if you put that into relation of the EUR 2.4 billion to EUR 2.6 billion of our guidance. But this is, to a great extent, some sort of phasing implication to a great extent, also coming from our various programs that we have together with our collaboration partner, Pfizer. <br/>So I wouldn't read too much into this. I would -- we reiterated that guidance. Please also take into account that we have reflected under and already in there and to a great extent duality, spending for our clinical studies here. So we feel comfortable with the EUR 2.4 billion to EUR 2.6 billion in the course of the next quarters.",
			"<strong>Chris Shibutani</strong>",
			"And then to follow-on, Pfizer during their meeting in December outlined their vision for what the vaccines for COVID could look like usage, particularly in the U.S. out for the next 3 or 4 years. There was a factor in there in terms of potential for combination with flu. Can you talk to what the BioNTech house view is? Were you involved with these projections? If there's any fundamental differences in your point of view, where might they lie?",
			"<strong>Ryan Richardson</strong>",
			"Yes, thanks for the question. So yes, we're very involved with Pfizer on an operational level and also on the commercial planning level globally as a co-commercialization partner. I think it's fair to say that Pfizer has taken the driver's seat in the U.S. commercial sphere. We've been very involved in Europe and also in other geographies. <br/>I think how we look at it, this is that it's a little too early to be precise and prescribe a factor to the contribution from combinations at this point. I think we need to see more data. I think what we outlined today is that we do see combinations, respiratory combination specifically as a potential, one of multiple potential growth drivers over the mid- to longer term for the franchise. So that is something that we're looking very closely at with our partner, multiple angles there. And I think Pfizer brings a lot to the table there, but so do we in terms of thinking about how combinations could be best deployed to meet patient need.",
			"<strong>Chris Shibutani</strong>",
			"Great. Thanks. We'll look for the data as it progresses.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber from Cowen. As there is no response, I will go to the next question, and your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn, Morgan Stanley.",
			"<strong>Terence C. Flynn</strong>",
			"Just had a follow-up on the iNeST vaccine program. I was wondering if you can just discuss high level about how you're thinking about likelihood of success in the adjuvant versus the metastatic setting. I think Merck and Moderna have focused more on the adjuvant setting, but obviously, you're taking a more broader approach. So just wondering if you could elaborate there.",
			"<strong>Ugur Sahin</strong>",
			"Yes, I can take this question. And the question is a very important one. With regard for the development, we have an early adjuvant study in melanoma, and we have initiated 2 additional adjuvant stage trials, one in triple-negative breast cancer, for which we do not yet have reports; and the second one in pancreatic cancer, which we have reported at ASCO last year and where we are expecting a publication in the next few weeks.<br/>And in the adjuvant setting, the clear understanding is that we have, as compared to the metastatic setting, a higher immunogenicity rate even though using the same vaccine platform. And in the melanoma and now previously reported contract at cancer study, we have shown that immune responses are correlated, this prevention of relapses or with a reduced relapse rate in this patient population. <br/>We have also reported the metastatic study, Phase I study, which yielded also immunogenicity, but to a much weaker extent than the actual setting. And based on this, we can clearly say that at least in the setting, how the vaccines are used so far, we see an improved activity in the adjuvant-stage. There are other reasons why adjuvant-stage cancers could be more eligible. This is, first of all, the lack of heavily established tumor micro environment, the lower tumor load and most importantly in the adjuvant setting, there is a window of opportunity, so the tumors do not progress in the first 6 to -- or in the first 3 months, giving the opportunity to build an immune response, which can then deal with the tumor. <br/>So in the totality, we believe that the adjuvant stage is the type of diseases to go. We have, as you know, randomized clinical trial in colorectal cancers running since 2019. We expect here readout data from this randomized colorectal cancer trial in 2024, yes. And we are planning a Phase II study based -- randomized Phase II study in pancreatic cancer based on the data that we have observed.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber, Cowen.",
			"<strong>Yaron Benjamin Werber</strong>",
			"I got a quick question on Pfizer and your flu vaccine, 161. The 25,000 patients -- I'm sorry, U.S. healthy adult study is ongoing. Any sense as to when you think we might be able to see data this year? Is it -- are you thinking sort of in the fall? And is that sufficient to follow? Do you need to run an additional study potentially in the rest of the world or even in the Southern Hemisphere? <br/>And then secondly, my understanding that's the quadrant modified RNA vaccine. Any update on the self-amplifying mRNA vaccine for flu as well?",
			"<strong>Ryan Richardson</strong>",
			"Yes, Yaron, I'll start and, Ugur, you may want to add to this. But I think it's -- just to start off, it's important to reiterate that we licensed that program in 2018 to Pfizer. So they're really in the driver's seat in terms of development. We do have rights to royalties and milestones upon success. And so of course, we're tracking that with them and working with them on the broader program. But I think Pfizer has guided to an update this year. I don't think they've specified in that we don't want to contradict what they put out. So I'll leave it at that. And the same goes, Yaron, for the self-amplifying program, both are -- fall under our collaboration agreement with Pfizer.",
			"<strong>Yaron Benjamin Werber</strong>",
			"So Ryan, maybe just a follow-up, when for the flu-COVID combo, can you give us any sense at all as to whether your royalty is going to be sort of a blended between your low teens, let's say, for flu and you're 50-50 for COVID?",
			"<strong>Ryan Richardson</strong>",
			"Yes, it's a great question. And I think blended is the right way to think about it. We haven't disclosed with Pfizer the specific economics, but I think it's fair to assume that would be a blend. As you know, we have a 50% gross profit share on the COVID-19 vaccine, and we do have a royalty on flu. And so there are still ongoing discussions about that. But I think we'll leave that for now until we can present some data and discuss next steps for the programs.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And your next question comes from the line of Jessica Fye from JPMorgan.",
			"<strong>Unidentified Analyst</strong>",
			"This is [Nasan] on for Jessica Fye. I think I want to ask about the FixVac program and the progress there and when we might get to see initial data on that program. And then whether like in light of the comment on metastatic versus adjuvant setting, how you're thinking about the development for FixVac?",
			"<strong>Ugur Sahin</strong>",
			"Maybe I'll take the second question on, Ryan, if you could take the first question would be great. Yes. So for 6 Vac, we have some generated data in the metastatic setting in patients with melanoma, particularly with a high proportion of patients, who did (inaudible) under existing PD-1 therapy and have seen in objective responses and high rate of [immunogens] of captive responses in combination with anti-PD1 in the range of 35% to 40% with vaccine alone in the range of 20%. <br/>The key advantage of FixVac as compared to the customer life the antigen vaccine is the availability of the vaccine directly after patient inclusion. So that means we do not have this 4 to 6 weeks of waiting time until patients can be dosed. Therefore, in principle, FixVac could be an option for patients with advanced metastatic disease. <br/>But again, here, it's a question of the combination compound. And this is something that is now in the focus of our upcoming studies evaluating the use of this vaccines in combination with our checkpoint immune model later, for example, the bispecific BNT312 and BNT311 molecules, but as well as our rybocytokine molecules, the modified IL-2, IL-7 have an approach.",
			"<strong>Ryan Richardson</strong>",
			"Yes. And in terms of the time lines, we haven't guided any fixed date updates this year. So I would say that 2024 is the most likely. And as you know, we have multiple trials ongoing, multiple trials, so recruiting in NSCLC in refractory melanoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma may name a few, so likely 2024.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And your next question comes from the line of Bill Maughan from Canaccord.",
			"<strong>William Patrick Maughan</strong>",
			"So I have 2 on the broader strategy. So first of all, some of the more recent BD, the partnerships our focus to look more on late-stage clinical programs and less on massive paradigm shifting earlier stage programs. So is there an internal push to reach profitability on some certain time line on the non-COVID portfolio? <br/>And then second related question is, are there any other technology platforms that you want to get into that you don't have that technology yet?",
			"<strong>Ryan Richardson</strong>",
			"Yes, thank you. So maybe I'll take the first one and then, Ugur, if you want to speak to the technology platforms piece. In terms of the rationale for the recent deals, I think what we have been is clear about our intention to go commercial in the oncology portfolio by 2026 onwards. And so we have multiple internal programs that if successful in late-stage trials could give us opportunities around that time period to bring products to market. <br/>And so what you've seen us do with these BD deals is basically add depth, further depth to that sort of wave 1 of oncology programs that have potential to be successful to get to market around that same time frame. In addition, we've gone for programs that can serve as backbones. So we've really tried to maximize synergy rather than solving for profitability near term, mid- to long-term synergy with our own pipeline. And so you see that with the anti-CTLA-4 molecule. You see that also with the HER2 ADC with ADC modalities in general. Again, programs and technologies that we think could combine very well with our existing pipeline.",
			"<strong>Ugur Sahin</strong>",
			"Yes. Thank you, Ryan. With regard to technologies, no, we are not looking to any disruptive technology. We have a number on disruptive technologies in-house. But what we are clearly doing is we are evaluating technology modules and that could close gaps in our technology platforms or further augment the activity of our technology platforms.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And your next question comes from the line of Zhiqiang Shu from Berenberg.",
			"<strong>Zhiqiang Shu</strong>",
			"I have 2. First, I wanted to ask about the FixVac BNT116. I think you mentioned you're going to start a Phase II program in first-line lung cancer. I wonder if you can comment on any signals from Phase I that gives you the confidence to start a Phase II?",
			"<strong>Ugur Sahin</strong>",
			"Short answer, no, we do not have any updates so far from the running clinical type that is expected end of the season.",
			"<strong>Zhiqiang Shu</strong>",
			"Got it. And then a quick follow-up on the -- your ADC deal. Can you talk about the, I guess, the comparison in top 1 pier at the payload versus microtubule inhibitors payload in terms of the combination with IO differences and similarities there?",
			"<strong>Ugur Sahin</strong>",
			"Yes. One, I think the most important aspect is for getting ADC technologies is that we believe that in the next 6, 7, 8 years, this ADC technologies will more or less complete the -- completely replace chemotherapy. So that means any type of combination therapy, which requires chemotherapy backbone might end up in an ADC approach. <br/>With regard to the currently evaluated compounds and TOP2 inhibitors come with a profile allowing sustainable and also long-term application. And we have also seen now in several studies that they are ideally suited as backbone for combinations with IO compounds. We do not exclude that we could be -- we might be also interested in microtubule inhibitors, but several of the microtubular inhibitors have been in the past, at least in the chemotherapeutic setting associated with (inaudible), and we believe that this new compound class should give the opportunity to develop treatments, which do not come with dose-limiting toxicity with regard to repeated application.",

			"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.",
			"By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.",
			"However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.",
			"Novo Nordisk (NVO) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.",
			"Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.",
			"While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this drugmaker is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:",
			"<b>Earnings Growth</b>",
			"Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.",
			"While the historical EPS growth rate for Novo Nordisk is 9.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 43.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 3.1%.",
			"<b>Cash Flow Growth</b>",
			"Cash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.",
			"Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Novo Nordisk is 4.1%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 2.7%.",
			"While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 7.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 6.5%.",
			"<b>Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions</b>",
			"Beyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.",
			"There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Novo Nordisk. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 9.9% over the past month.",
			"<b>Bottom Line</b>",
			"While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Novo Nordisk a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.",
			"You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.",
			"This combination positions Novo Nordisk well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.",

EPD successfully continued its double-digit sales growth momentum in the last two years.<br/><br/>Within Nutrition, sales increased more than 10%. In the United States, pediatric nutrition growth of more than 35% was driven by favorable year-ago comparable (lower sales in the first quarter of 2022 were due to a voluntary recall of certain infant formula products). Abbott continued to make good progress, increasing manufacturing production and recovering market share in this business. Internationally, total nutrition sales grew in mid-single digits overall.

Worldwide COVID-19 testing sales were $730 million in the first quarter compared with $3.3 billion in the year-ago period. Further, in Core Lab Diagnostics, growth was partially offset by soft market conditions in China.<br/><br/>Challenging macroeconomic environment, adverse currency translation and stubborn inflationary situation severely impacted the company’s profitability in the first quarter.

(<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:NASDAQ:ISRG;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-isrg/intuitive-surgical?blueprint=2500061&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=intro&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NASDAQ:ISRG</a>) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 87% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).",
			"Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.",
			"Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Intuitive Surgical, beginning with the chart below.",

			"Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.",
			"As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Intuitive Surgical. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Intuitive Surgical's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.",
			"Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Intuitive Surgical. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.4%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.1% and 6.0% of the stock.",
			"A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 21 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.",
			"While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.",
			"While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.",
			"Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.",
			"Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Intuitive Surgical, Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$517m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:see if those insiders have been buying or selling.;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-isrg/intuitive-surgical/ownership?blueprint=2500061&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=integrated-pitch&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> see if those insiders have been buying or selling. </a>",
			"With a 13% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Intuitive Surgical. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.",
			"While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.",

One way to find winning stocks based on your preferred way of investing is to use the Zacks Style Scores, which are indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing types: value, growth, and momentum.",
			"<b>Why Investors Should Pay Attention to This Value Stock</b>",
			"Finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks.",
			"<b>Elevance Health (ELV)</b>",
			"Based in Indianapolis, IN, Elevance Health is one of the largest publicly traded health insurers in the United States, in terms of membership. The company was previously named Anthem, Inc. Effective Jun 27, 2022, the corporate name was changed to Elevance Health and began trading under the ticker “ELV” on Jun 28. Before Anthem, it was named WellPoint Inc.",
			"ELV sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), holds a Value Style Score of A, and has a VGM Score of A. Compared to the Medical Services industry's P/E of 18.8X, shares of Elevance Health are trading at a forward P/E of 14.2X. ELV also has a PEG Ratio of 1.2, a Price/Cash Flow ratio of 12.8X, and a Price/Sales ratio of 0.7X.",
			"Value investors don't just pay attention to a company's valuation ratios; positive earnings play a crucial role, too. Five analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.06 to $32.74 per share. ELV has an average earnings surprise of 3.2%.",
			"With strong valuation and earnings metrics, a good Zacks Rank, and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, investors should strongly think about adding ELV to their portfolios.",

			"<b>Pfizer</b> (PFE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.",
			"Over the past month, shares of this drugmaker have returned -7.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Pfizer falls in, has gained 3.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?",
			"While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.",
			"<b>Earnings Estimate Revisions</b>",
			"Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.",
			"Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.",
			"For the current quarter, Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $0.65 per share, indicating a change of -68.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.",
			"For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.35 points to a change of -49.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.5%.",
			"For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.40 indicates a change of +1.6% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -10.3%.",
			"With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Pfizer.",
			"The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:",
			"<b>12 Month EPS</b>",
			"<b>Projected Revenue Growth</b>",
			"While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.",
			"In the case of Pfizer, the consensus sales estimate of $14.26 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -48.6%. The $67.79 billion and $67.46 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -32.4% and -0.5%, respectively.",
			"<b>Last Reported Results and Surprise History</b>",
			"Pfizer reported revenues of $18.28 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -28.8%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $1.62 a year ago.",
			"Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.82%. The EPS surprise was +23%.",
			"The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.",
			"<b>Valuation</b>",
			"Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.",
			"While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.",
			"As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.",
			"Pfizer is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.",
			"<b>Bottom Line</b>",
			"The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Pfizer. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.",

Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.",
			"No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.",
			"Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in <span class=\"xn-location\">Puerto Rico</span>, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.",

			"Chicago, IL – May 8, 2023 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Stryker SYK, Boston Scientific BSX, Zimmer Biomet ZBH and Insulet PODD.",
			"Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2090763/4-medical-products-stocks-to-capitalize-on-the-industrys-recovery",
			"After macroeconomic headwinds impacted the top and bottom lines of Zacks Medical – Products industry participants in 2022, there seems to have been a recovery in the first quarter of 2023. The supply-chain challenges that adversely impacted shipments in 2022 started to dissipate in the last quarter of 2022 and the improvement continues in 2023.",
			"As the supply chain eases going forward, top-line growth will continue to improve. The European and international markets are also showing signs of a steady recovery in demand for medical products. Meanwhile, the rising cost of materials and labor shortages that resulted in inflationary pressure in 2022 are likely to continue. However, the impact is likely to be less severe than last year due to a favorable base effect. A gradual increase in pricing of products and services will also help to offset higher costs and expenses.",
			"Several industry players have the potential to ride on the recovery trend within the industry, creating wealth for investors. Industry participants like <strong>Stryker</strong>, <strong>Boston Scientific</strong>, <strong>Zimmer Biomet</strong> and <strong>Insulet</strong> are likely to gain from the rebound in demand and new cost-cutting initiatives.",
			"The industry includes companies providing medical products and cutting-edge technologies for diagnosis, observation, consultation, treatment and other healthcare services. The industry players are primarily focused on research and development. The industry participants primarily cater to vital therapeutic areas like cardiovascular, nephrology and urology devices, to name a few.",
			"A strengthening dollar and labor shortages are hurting top-line growth. Ongoing disruption due to volume-based procurement policy in China is hurting sales. Recent inflationary pressure and labor shortages are weighing on gross and operating margins of the industry players. The trend is likely to continue in 2023. However, rising demand for medical procedures along with cost-cutting initiatives is likely to drive industry performance going forward.",
			"<strong>AI, Medical Mechatronics &amp; Robotics:</strong> The rising utilization of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, use of IT for quick and improved patient care and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model underscore the growing influence of AI in the Medical Products space. In fact, mechatronics — a high-end technology incorporating electronics, machine learning and mechanical engineering — is rapidly becoming a defining characteristic of the space.",
			"There are several companies that have shown substantial prowess when it comes to their involvement in AI, robotics and medical mechatronics. Advancements in robot-assisted surgical platforms continue to be crucial with respect to minimally-invasive surgery that helps in reducing trauma associated with open surgery.",
			"With respect to Mechatronics, the benefits of the same have been demonstrated in the form of 3D printing, which has altered the face of the medical devices industry. Currently, 3D printing is being utilized to print stem cells, blood vessels, heart tissues, prosthetic organs and skin.",
			"<strong>Rising Demand for IVD: </strong>Toward the end of February 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak started to spread rapidly and took the shape of a pandemic. This led to a rise in global demand for diagnostic testing kits in order to curb the spread of the virus. Testing became the need of the hour and that led to a shift in the pipeline of IVD products, with a large number of rapid, point-of-care devices going into development. Companies not only received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA but also bolstered production to aid testing shortages. Industry players anticipate significant demand for rapid diagnostic testing in the future as well and are well-poised to capitalize on the same.",
			"<strong>Emerging Markets Hold Promise:</strong> Given the rising medical awareness and economic prosperity, emerging economies have been witnessing solid demand for medical products. An aging population, relaxed regulations, cheap skilled labor, increasing wealth and government focus on healthcare infrastructure make these markets extremely lucrative for global medical device players.",
			"The Zacks Medical Products industry falls within the broader Zacks Medical sector.",
			"It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #96, which places it in the top 38% of more than 250 Zacks industries.",
			"The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.",
			"Before we present a few medical products stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.",
			"The industry has underperformed its own sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite in the past year.",
			"Stocks in this industry have collectively declined 28.1% compared with the Zacks Medical sector's decline of 6.2%. The S&amp;P 500 has lost 1.1% in the same time frame.",
			"On the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry is currently trading at 23.1X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 18.2X and the sector's 22.9X.",
			"Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 29.9X and as low as 19.2X, with the median being 23.7X.",
			"<strong>Insulet: </strong>The company is a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of the Omnipod Insulin Management System. The system is equipped with a self-adhesive, small and lightweight disposable tubeless Omnipod device along with the wireless and handheld Personal Diabetes Manager for pain-free automated cannula insertion and blood glucose meter integration. Insulet earns a huge share of revenues from the Omnipod System in the United States, Canada, Europe and Israel.",
			"The company's performance benefited from record quarterly U.S. and Total Omnipod new customer starts during the first quarter. This was driven mainly by a strong start to the company's U.S. full market release of the Omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system.",
			"However, the substantial fall in Drug Delivery sales is discouraging. Contraction in margins does not bode well. On a year-over-year basis, the company expects gross margin to be impacted by higher costs associated with the U.S. manufacturing ramp, product line mix due to the ramp-up of Omnipod 5 and lower drug delivery revenues. Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressure continue to challenge business operations.",
			"Following the first-quarter results, Insulet raised the total revenue growth guidance to the range of 18-22% on a reported basis (up from the prior projection of 14-19%). Total Omnipod sales are likely to improve by 21-25% in 2023.",
			"For this Acton, MA-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues suggests an improvement of 16.5%. The consensus estimate for earnings indicates an improvement of 1742.9%. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 59.81%, on average. Presently, the company sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).",
			"<strong>Stryker: </strong>Stryker is one of the world's largest medical device companies operating in the global orthopedic market. The company has three business segments: Orthopaedics, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology &amp; Spine.",
			"Stryker continues to deliver strong organic sales growth on the back of robust demand for its MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses, led by Endoscopy, Instruments and Neurocranial. The Orthopedics and Spine businesses are also on an encouraging growth path, reflecting procedural recovery throughout the quarter.",
			"The company witnessed strong performance across its segments in the United States. Strong International sales also buoy optimism. It expects the momentum to continue into 2023 on the back of ongoing procedural recovery and a strong order book for capital equipment. Stryker continues to witness strong demand for its robotic-arm-assisted surgery platform — Mako — on the back of its unique features and healthy order book. However, supply-chain challenges and inflationary pressures continue to impede growth.",
			"Following its strong first-quarter 2023 results, the company expects total revenue growth at a constant exchange rate (\"CER\") of 8-9% for 2023. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be within $10.05-$10.25, up from the prior guidance of $9.85-$10.15. Currently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.",
			"For this Kalamazoo, MI-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $19.9 billion. The consensus mark for earnings stands at $10.12 per share. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.60%, on average.",
			"<strong>Boston Scientific: </strong>The company manufactures medical devices and products used in various interventional medical specialties worldwide. It is one of the leading players in the interventional cardiology market with its coronary stent product offerings. Boston Scientific first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings and revenues exceeded market expectations by decent margins.",
			"The company registered a strong year-over-year improvement in organic sales, indicating a solid rebound in the legacy business even amid several macroeconomic issues. The increased 2023 guidance increases investors' confidence, indicating that the company is well-poised to handle the industry-wise trend of currency headwinds and global inflationary pressure. However, mounting operating expenses are putting pressure on the company's gross margin.",
			"Following the strong first-quarter results, Boston Scientific raised total revenue growth guidance to the range of 8.5-10.5% on a reported basis (up from the prior projection of 5-7%). Organic revenue growth is currently expected in the range of 8-10%. The company also raised the lower end of its guidance for adjusted earnings from $1.86-$1.93 to $1.90-$1.96.",
			"For this Natick, MA-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues suggest an improvement of 9.2%. The consensus estimate for earnings indicates an improvement of 13.5%. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.88%, on average. Presently, the company carries a Zacks Rank of 2.",
			"<strong>Zimmer Biomet: </strong>It is a leading musculoskeletal healthcare company that designs, manufactures and markets orthopedic reconstructive products; sports medicine, biologics, extremities and trauma products; spine, bone healing, craniomaxillofacial and thoracic products; dental implants; and related surgical products.",
			"Zimmer Biomet ended the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Each of the company's geographic segments and product divisions recorded strong year-over-year sales growth at CER. Management noted continued procedure recovery, solid execution and increasing traction around innovations in the reported quarter.",
			"Even amid the challenging macroeconomic conditions, expansion in the company's adjusted gross and operating margins is encouraging. The raised 2023 guidance is an indication of the strong growth momentum to continue through the year. Meanwhile, the last few quarters witnessed gradual stability in the global musculoskeletal market with better-than-expected sales growth in certain geographies, banking on improved procedural volume.",
			"Following encouraging first-quarter results, the company expects its revenue and adjusted earnings to grow 5-6% and 7-9%, respectively compared with the 2022 metrics. Currently, the company has a Zacks Rank #2.",
			"For this Warsaw, IN-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $7.14 billion. The consensus mark for earnings stands at $7.34 per share. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.38%, on average.",

			"Wall Street is caught in feeble trading triggered by an uncertain Fed policy, growing geopolitical tensions and recession fears. This has compelled investors to look for safe and defensive bets, thus raising the appeal for dividend investing. In fact, applying some smart-beta strategies to the dividend investing world could fetch higher returns.<br/><br/>This is because the strategy helps to capture market inefficiencies in a transparent way by adding extra metrics like volatility, revenues, earnings, momentum and other fundamental factors to the market cap or rules-based indices. And nothing seems better than picking the dividend growth strategy.<br/><br/>We have selected five dividend growth stocks — <strong>PulteGroup Inc.</strong> PHM, <strong>Novartis</strong> NVS, <strong>Boyd Gaming Corporation</strong> BYD, <strong>Cummins</strong> CMI, and <strong>W.W. Grainger Inc.</strong> GWW — that could be solid choices for your portfolio.",
			"Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.<br/><br/>Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.<br/><br/>Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.<br/><br/>As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.<br/><br/><strong>5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero</strong>: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.<br/><br/><strong>5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero</strong>: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.<br/><br/><strong>5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero</strong>: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.<br/><br/><strong>Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero</strong>: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.<br/><br/><strong>Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry</strong>: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.<br/><br/><strong>52-Week Price Change greater than S&amp;P 500 (Market Weight)</strong>: This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&amp;P 500 over the past year.<br/><br/><strong>Top Zacks Rank</strong>: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.<br/><br/><strong>Growth Score</strong><strong> of B or better</strong>: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.<br/><br/>Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 20.<br/><br/>Here are five of the 20 stocks that fit the bill:<br/><br/>Atlanta-based <strong>PulteGroup</strong> is engaged in homebuilding and financial services businesses, primarily in the United States. The company saw a solid earnings estimate revision of $1.34 over the past 30 days for this year and delivered an average earnings surprise of 15.6% over the past four quarters.<br/><br/>PulteGroup carries a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Growth Score of B. You can see <strong>the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br/><br/>Switzerland-based <strong>Novartis</strong> has one of the strongest and broadest portfolios of oncology drugs and generics, which has enabled it to maintain its dominant position as a top pharma company over the years. The company saw a solid earnings estimate revision of nine cents over the past 30 days for this year, with estimated growth of 9.2%.<br/><br/>At present, NVS has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of B.<br/><br/>Las Vegas-based <strong>Boyd Gaming</strong> is a multi-jurisdictional gaming company. It owns and operates gaming entertainment properties in Nevada, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania. The company saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 37 cents over the past 30 days for this year and delivered an earnings surprise of 13.69% over the past four quarters.<br/><br/>Boyd Gaming has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B.<br/><br/>Indiana-based <strong>Cummins</strong> is a leading global designer, manufacturer and distributor of diesel and natural gas engines, and powertrain-related component products. It has seen a solid earnings estimate revision of 70 cents for this year over the past month, and has an estimated earnings growth rate of 30%.<br/><br/>The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B.<br/><br/>Illinois-based <strong>W.W. Grainger</strong> is a broad-line, business-to-business distributor of maintenance, repair and operating products and services. The company has an estimated growth rate of 18.1% and delivered an average earnings surprise of 9.15% for the past four quarters.<br/><br/>GWW has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A.<br/><br/>You can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

Hence, creating a portfolio of low-beta stocks is of utmost importance since the securities will deliver healthy returns and shield against choppy market conditions.",

			"Transportadora de Gas del Sur has witnessed upward estimate revisions for its 2023 bottom line in the past 30 days.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.",

			"Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP &amp; Chief Commercial Officer, Jeffrey Stewart, for US$4.8m worth of shares, at about US$152 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$148. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.",

			"Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that AbbVie insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$279m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.",
			"Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious.

(NYSE: PFE) today announced they will present updated data related to vepdegestrant (ARV-471) at the 2023 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Breast Cancer Annual Congress. Vepdegestrant is a novel investigational PROTAC<sup>®</sup> estrogen receptor (ER) protein degrader that is being jointly developed by Arvinas and Pfizer for the treatment of patients with early and locally advanced or metastatic ER positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative (ER+/HER2-) breast cancer. Four posters will be presented during the poster session at the annual congress, which will be held from May 11-13, 2023, in Berlin, Germany.<br/>",

			"<strong>About vepdegestrant</strong> (<strong>ARV-471)</strong><br/>Vepdegestrant is an investigational, orally bioavailable PROTAC<sup>®</sup> protein degrader designed to specifically target and degrade the estrogen receptor (ER) for the treatment of patients with early and locally advanced or metastatic ER positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative (ER+/HER2-) breast cancer. Use of vepdegestrant in the ongoing and planned clinical trials will continue to monitor and evaluate patient safety and anti-tumor activity.",
			"In preclinical studies, vepdegestrant demonstrated up to 97% ER degradation in tumor cells, induced robust tumor shrinkage when dosed as a single agent in multiple ER-driven xenograft models, and showed increased anti-tumor activity when compared to a standard of care agent, fulvestrant, both as a single agent and in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. In July 2021, Arvinas announced a global collaboration with Pfizer for the co-development and co-commercialization of vepdegestrant; Arvinas and Pfizer will equally share worldwide development costs, commercialization expenses, and profits.",

			"By Natalie Grover",
			"LONDON, May 8 (Reuters) - Diabetes drugs that also promote weight loss such as Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic, becoming a darling of celebrities and investors, are being studied to tackle some of the most difficult-to-treat brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease.",
			"Diabetes regimens, from Ozempic to old mainstays like insulin and metformin, appear to address several different aspects of the metabolic system implicated in Alzheimer's disease, including a protein called amyloid and inflammation, researchers say.",
			"The hope is that improving glucose utilisation and tamping down inflammation in the entire body - including the brain - could slow progression of debilitating diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.",
			"Several scientists interviewed by Reuters pointed to mounting research supporting testing diabetes drugs against neurodegenerative diseases.",
			"Results are years away and success uncertain. But interest has been buoyed by recent positive data on Alzheimer's drugs developed by Eisai Co Ltd with partner Biogen and by Eli Lilly and Co demonstrating that removing sticky amyloid plaques accumulated in the brain can slow cognition decline caused by the fatal mind-wasting disease.",
			"Those successes followed decades of futility that had left many questioning the validity of the amyloid theory behind most experimental Alzheimer's drugs.",
			"Dr. Suzanne Craft, professor of gerontology and geriatric medicine at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, gave a keynote speech at an influential Alzheimer's scientific meeting late last year about the need to test treatments such as diabetes drugs to further reduce the advance of Alzheimer's.",
			"She said she has since been approached by pharmaceutical companies at an increasing pace, and is currently running an Alzheimer’s trial evaluating intranasal insulin in combination with another diabetes drug.",
			"Diabetes treatments may amplify the clinical benefit of anti-amyloid drugs, and potentially lead to complete stabilization or even some recovery in Alzheimer's patients, Craft said.",
			"\"This is what these agents do, and what insulin does. It plays a role in regeneration. And that's what needs to happen. Given its role in modulating immune function, it may prevent the amyloid from continuing to accumulate,\" Craft surmised.",
			"Unlike older off-patent medicines like metformin, there is commercial incentive to test newer treatments such as GLP-1 agonists, a rapidly expanding class now dominated by Ozempic, known chemically as semaglutide, and Lilly's Mounjaro, with other players working on a dozen potential new treatments.",
			"Four companies with GLP-1 drugs, including two larger drugmakers, say they are watching for results of trials testing Novo's drug in Alzheimer's.",
			"Ivan Koychev, consultant neuropsychiatrist for Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, is running a trial testing semaglutide with the aim of halting the earliest changes in the brains of people at risk of developing Alzheimer's.",
			"GLP-1s are his primary focus, he said, because there is \"good epidemiological evidence that they are linked to lower risk for dementia but run much lower risk of serious side-effects relative to the amyloid clearance therapies.\"",
			"Anti-amyloid therapies carry the risk of dangerous brain swelling.",
			"Any success could lead to a big payoff. Dementia affects more than 55 million people globally and the market for Alzheimer’s drugs is expected to grow to $9.4 billion by 2028 and for Parkinson’s to $6.6 billion, according to pharmaceutical data provider Citeline.",
			"Despite their potential against Alzheimer's, early research has yielded mixed results, cautioned Hannah Churchill, research communications manager at the Alzheimer's Society.",
			"\"It's definitely worth pursuing, but it's difficult to know whether this is a front-runner at this stage,\" she said.",
			"EYE ON NOVO",
			"Novo in 2021 began two trials testing semaglutide - also sold for weight loss as Wegovy - in thousands of patients with early Alzheimer’s. Results are expected by 2025 as it takes years to show an effect on the progressive condition.",
			"The Danish drugmaker declined to be interviewed for this story.",
			"\"Everyone is waiting to see what that might show. Investors want somebody else to first take the risk in Alzheimer’s, like Novo,\" said Ted Dawson, professor of neurology at John Hopkins University and co-founder of Neuraly, which has an experimental GLP-1 drug.",
			"Lilly told Reuters it is watching that trial closely. Pfizer , which has experimental GLP-1s, also has its eye on Novo.",
			"Smaller companies, including U.S.-based Neuraly and Denmark-based Kariya Pharmaceuticals, said they are evaluating experimental GLP-1 drugs against Parkinson’s and could consider moving onto Alzheimer’s should the Novo trial bear fruit.",
			"Parkinson's trials tend to take less time and may require fewer patients because it's easier to assess the impact on motor function characteristics of the disease to understand whether the treatments benefit the brain.",
			"Wassilios Meissner, head of the department of neurology for neurodegenerative diseases at University Hospital Bordeaux, is involved in a mid-stage Parkinson's trial testing Sanofi's GLP-1 lixisenatide.",
			"Meissner said postmortem research of the brains of both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's patients shows insulin signalling is impaired.",
			"\"That means that these pathways that provide support to the brain are dysfunctional,\" he said. \"So people have started questioning whether there might be an interest for anti-diabetics for the treatment of these disorders.\"",

			"Dividend aristocrats are the companies in the S&amp;P 500 that have raised their dividends for 25 years or more. Value stocks trade at a lower price relative to their intrinsic value and typically have a lower price-to-earnings ratio. The concept of value investing, popularized by Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett, revolves around the belief that the market occasionally misprices stocks, leading to opportunities for seasoned investors to buy them at a discount. This investment strategy has proven to be successful over the long haul, delivering a total return of 1,344,600% since 1926, compared with a 626,000% return on growth stocks, as reported by <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Bank of America;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/value-vs-growth-stocks-performance/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bank of America</a>.",

The report mentioned that value stocks exceeded growth from January 1970 to February 2007 by 17 percentage points. During this period, inflation averaged 4.7%.",
			"Last year’s high inflation and consistent interest rate hikes also resulted in the dominance of value stocks over growth equities.

			"Yet it will likely take years for that to happen. In order to be distributed outside rich countries, the vaccines need adjustments—multi-dose vials, for instance, which are cheaper and more efficient to distribute in areas where transportation may be a challenge.

One would hope Pfizer learned lessons about faster vaccine delivery from that process.",
			"“They should have started planning this from day one when they thought that vaccine was successful,” says Nina Schwalbe, a professor at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. The high mortality rate of RSV in low-income countries should have made it a priority, she says.",
			"Pfizer likely started planning RSV vaccine introduction in the US as soon as the candidate showed promise, and should have done the same when it comes to the Global South, starting trials for multi-dose vials, cold chain stability, and other needs long before it received the Gates Foundation grant, says Schwalbe.",

Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock.

			"Depending on who you ask, you're likely to get different answers about the current state of human civilization and how we've evolved in just a couple of centuries. Key metrics such as poverty and hunger are on a downward trend - at least when we consider the last 'normal' point in history i.e. before the 2019 coronavirus pandemic.",
			"In fact, data from the United Nations' World Food Program shows that as soon as in 2005, almost a billion people were hungry on the planet, but in just a decade this figure dropped to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:770 million;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.wfpusa.org/articles/tedx-talks-are-we-ready-to-end-world-hunger/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">770 million</a> - indicating that humanity is making some progress on one of the most important of progress metrics. Yet, at the same time, diseases such as obesity are also on the rise, particularly in the developed world. While obesity has been studied and categorized for centuries, its growth is a relatively new phenomenon. Research <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:published;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/26/11/3172/22463/Prevention-of-Obesity-and-Diabetes\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">published</a> in the American Diabetes Association shows that before humans settled in societies and started growing their own food, their diet consisted primarily of hunted meat with low levels of fat and fruits and vegetables with high levels of fiber.",
			"However, the growth in agriculture led to plumper animals and by the time of the Renaissance, obesity was considered a sign of being wealthy. Ironically, in the U.S. it was the prohibition of alcoholic beverages that led to the growth in consumption of carbonated beverages. The launch of automobiles and the emergence of fast food joints further increased the caloric intake of the average American. At the same time, the food industry, eager to influence the habits of children, spends up to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:$12 billion a year;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/food-company-sponsorship-of-nutrition-research-and-professional-activities-a-conflict-of-interest/0DC05EE7794D352882D2F089111A0449\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$12 billion a year</a> to make its high calorie products more attractive. Even more ironically, it was the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)'s efforts to improve industrial production by providing the working class with cheap calories such as fat and sugar that started a cycle that has now led to high levels of obesity in many countries. (You can check out <a class=\"link yahoo-link\" data-ylk=\"slk:20 Most Obese Developed Countries in the World;elm:context_link;itc:0;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-most-obese-developed-countries-182711767.html\">20 Most Obese Developed Countries in the World</a> for obesity statistics in the developed world)",
			"Naturally, this growth in obesity has created a market of its own that is worth billions of dollars. In fact, the hype surrounding obesity might be reaching a feverish pitch soon if we believe analysts from the investment bank Morgan Stanley. A <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:research note;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/novo-nordisk-and-eli-lilly-poised-divvy-obesity-market-could-be-worth-50b-plus-2030-analysts\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">research note</a> issued by its analysts in July 2022 contends that obesity is the new hypertension. They compare the state of today's obesity market with that of the hypertension treatment industry from the 1980s to the 1990s, by the end of which it had turned into a $30 billion market. The value of obesity treatments can be even higher by 2030 as the analysts estimate that global obesity sales could sit at $54 billion by then. Backing their sales estimate by numbers, Morgan Stanley's analysts believe that in 2030 a quarter of obesity patients will consult with doctors, up from 7% in 2022. Out of these, more than half, or 55%, will be prescribed a treatment.",
			"Their research about the growth in obesity treatment is further backed up by a variety of new products on the market. Two drugs that have created a lot of hype recently are Tirzepatide and Wegovy. The former, belonging to Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:LLY;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/eli%20lilly%20%26%20co/59478/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LLY</a>), is a generic drug that is awaiting FDA approval. The latter, made by Novo Nordisk (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:NVO;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/novo%20nordisk%20a%20s/353278/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NVO</a>), is one of the hottest drugs for obesity right now. Tirzepatide is offered under the brand name Mounjaro, but right now, it is only approved as a diabetes treatment. Eli Lilly upped the pressure on the Federal Drug Administration in April 2023, as it shared results from its SURMOUNT-2 phase 3 global clinical trial. The drug maker's <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:results;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-tirzepatide-achieved-157-weight-loss-adults-obesity-or\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">results</a> showed that Mounjaro enabled users to lose as much as 15.7% of their body weight, with overall treatment discontinuation rates sitting at 9.3% and 3.8% of users stopping treatment due to adverse effects. The most common side effects experienced were nausea and diarrhea. Wondering how much Mounjaro will cost? Well, Mounjaro costs about a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:$1,000 per month;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/eli-lilly-seeks-fda-approval-for-weight-loss-drug-tirzepatide/#x\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$1,000 per month</a> and is not covered by insurance.",
			"Additionally, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk might not remain the only companies in town to fight obesity. Other firms are also interested in developing treatments, such as Zealand Pharma A/S (CPH:ZEAL.CO) and Altimmune, Inc. (NASDAQ:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:ALT;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/altimmune+inc/1326190/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ALT</a>). The latter shared a mean weight loss of 10.7% from the phase 2 clinical trial of its pemvidutide drug. However, 24% of the patients chose to discontinue the drug due to nausea and vomiting, with one case being so severe that the test subject had to undergo rehydration.",
			"However, Altimmune's drug is unique in the sense that it allows for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and obesity at the same time. NASH is liver damage due to fat buildup, and the firm's executives shared during its <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:earnings call;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/altimmune-inc-nasdaqalt-q4-2022-earnings-call-transcript-1126871/?singlepage=1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">earnings call</a> for the fourth quarter of 2022:",

			"Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Eli Lilly paid out more than half (64%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. The company paid out 97% of its free cash flow over the last year, which we think is outside the ideal range for most businesses. Cash flows are usually much more volatile than earnings, so this could be a temporary effect - but we'd generally want to look more closely here.",
			"While Eli Lilly's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, cash is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Were this to happen repeatedly, this would be a risk to Eli Lilly's ability to maintain its dividend.",

			"Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. That's why it's comforting to see Eli Lilly's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 25% per annum for the past five years. Earnings have been growing quickly, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year.",
			"Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Eli Lilly has delivered 8.7% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.",
			"From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Eli Lilly? It's good to see that earnings per share are growing and that the company's payout ratio is within a normal range for most businesses. However we're somewhat concerned that it paid out 97% of its cashflow, which is uncomfortably high. While it does have some good things going for it, we're a bit ambivalent and it would take more to convince us of Eli Lilly's dividend merits.",

			"<strong>Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:</strong>",
			"Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity",

			"26% = US$5.5b ÷ US$21b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).",
			"The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.26 in profit.",
			"By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Gilead Sciences has a superior ROE than the average (21%) in the <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Biotechs industry;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/us/healthcare/biotech?blueprint=2498265&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=industry&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Biotechs industry</a>.",
			"That's clearly a positive. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk. You can see the 3 risks we have identified for Gilead Sciences by visiting our <b>risks dashboard</b> for free <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:on our platform here.;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nasdaq-gild/gilead-sciences?blueprint=2498265&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=conclusion&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> on our platform here.</a>",
			"Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.",
			"It's worth noting the high use of debt by Gilead Sciences, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.21. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.",
			"Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.",
			"But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this.

			"Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that <strong>Pfizer Inc.</strong> (<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:NYSE:PFE;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nyse-pfe/pfizer?blueprint=2496915&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=intro&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NYSE:PFE</a>) is about to go ex-dividend in just 4 days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Thus, you can purchase Pfizer's shares before the 11th of May in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 9th of June.",
			"The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.41 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.64 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Pfizer has a trailing yield of approximately 4.3% on its current stock price of $38.49. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing.",
			"<span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Check out our latest analysis for Pfizer;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nyse-pfe/pfizer?blueprint=2496915&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Pfizer </a></span>",
			"Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Pfizer paid out a comfortable 31% of its profit last year. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 35% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.",
			"It's positive to see that Pfizer's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.",
			"Click <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nyse-pfe/pfizer/dividend?blueprint=2496915&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=integrated-pitch&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.</a>",
			"Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Pfizer, with earnings per share up 7.6% on average over the last five years. The company is retaining more than half of its earnings within the business, and it has been growing earnings at a decent rate. We think this is generally an attractive combination, as dividends can grow through a combination of earnings growth and or a higher payout ratio over time.",
			"The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Pfizer has lifted its dividend by approximately 6.4% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.",
			"Should investors buy Pfizer for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share growth has been growing somewhat, and Pfizer is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends. This is interesting for a few reasons, as it suggests management may be reinvesting heavily in the business, but it also provides room to increase the dividend in time. We would prefer to see earnings growing faster, but the best dividend stocks over the long term typically combine significant earnings per share growth with a low payout ratio, and Pfizer is halfway there. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.",
			"In light of that, while Pfizer has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. To that end, you should learn about the <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:2 warning signs we've spotted with Pfizer (including 1 which is significant);elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nyse-pfe/pfizer?blueprint=2496915&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=conclusion&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>2 warning signs </strong>we've spotted with Pfizer (including 1 which is significant)</a>.",

			"Great. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, the Cigna Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including our first quarter financial results and our updated financial outlook for 2023.<br/>As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, we use certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of thecignagroup.com. We use the term label adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance.<br/>In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2023 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these results and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.<br/>Regarding our results effective January 1, 2023, we adopted amended accounting guidance for long-duration insurance contracts, LDTI and related amendments. Our 2023 full year outlook included the impact of LDTI and prior results have been restated to reflect this change. There has been no material impact to our prior results, and this change will not materially impact our future operating results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2023 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2023 dividends. <br/>With that, I'll call -- turn the call over to David.",
			"<strong>David Michael Cordani</strong>",
			"Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining today's call. We begin 2023 with momentum. And in the first quarter, we again delivered strong performance and continued our long track record of innovating for customers, clients and partners. Today, I'll discuss some of the key drivers fueling our growth during the quarter and I'll also talk about how we're leading the way to address evolving stakeholder needs with a flexible and agile model, providing multiple avenues to deliver and capture value. Specifically, I'll describe how the durable and flexible pharmacy benefit services we offer, Continue to drive in the marketplace. Brian will provide additional detail about our financial results and discuss our outlook for 2023, and then we'll take your questions. <br/>With that, let's get started. In the first quarter, we delivered $46.5 billion in total revenues, $5.41 in adjusted earnings per share, and we are raising our full year 2023 guidance for adjusted EPS, revenue and customer growth.<br/>We are pleased with the strong start across Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Healthcare. And we look forward -- as we look forward, we expect another very good year for the Cigna Group. Evernorth comprising pharmacy benefit services, Specialty Pharmacy and Evernorth Care, again contributed strong growth while retaining, expanding and winning new relationships for the employers, health plans and governmental organizations we serve. Our foundational Pharmacy Benefit Service business continued its strong performance, demonstrating the value we provide to our clients and patients. Specialty Pharmacy, which accounts for approximately 40% of Evernorth's total revenue drove outsized growth with a continued rise in new-to-market specialty drugs and increasing demand. Evernorth Care represents one of our most significant long-term growth opportunities given the growing needs in virtual care as well as, for example, behavioral health services.<br/>In Cigna Healthcare, our health benefits platform, we achieved another quarter of revenue and customer growth with strong performance across our U.S. commercial, U.S. government and international health businesses. With our focus on affordability and disciplined pricing, we are pleased with our medical cost performance and our medical care ratio, which was 81.3%. Our U.S. commercial business is at pace for another good year. Our affordability initiatives continue to strengthen our overall competitive position, and this has helped fuel our strong customer growth. Our momentum also is a reflection of how employers of all sizes rely upon our consultative approach and the breadth of our solutions to support the health, engagement and productivity of their workforces.<br/>In the U.S. government, our Medicare Advantage business is achieving above-market growth in 2023 from our high-quality and affordable plans, our geographic expansion and the maturation of markets we previously expanded into. In the dynamic individual exchange market, we also have substantial growth in our Individual &amp; Family Plan business, allowing us to bring Cigna Healthcare capabilities to a larger customer base. And in International Health, our earnings growth has been strong for the past few years, and we expect positive top line and bottom line contributions again in 2023 and given our high-quality and localized health insurance solutions supported by our global provider network. Overall, we're pleased with the quality, strength and resilience demonstrated in our results. And importantly, how they position us for another year of sustained growth and attractive value creation.<br/>Looking ahead, we are confident in our increased outlook for the year as well as our ability to sustainably deliver 10% to 13% compounded EPS growth over our strategic horizon, along with providing an attractive dividend.<br/>Today, I want to spend a few minutes on Express Scripts, our pharmacy benefits business within Evernorth, including our recent announcements about how we are continuing to provide greater affordability, choice and transparency for our clients and customers. Pharmacy services have an essential and impactful role in a time when in medical care, physical or behavioral are increasingly relying upon the use of pharmaceutical interventions. It's also important to recognize that successful care coordination programs for pharmacy services often creates significant benefit and value for the medical services.<br/>We recognize the ongoing attention and legislative debate regarding the rising cost of prescription drugs. We are taking an active leadership role, and I want to be clear about how we are using our differentiated capabilities to create and capture value out of the drug supply chain on behalf of our clients and customers.<br/>First is the strength of our model. which is to deliver solutions and care coordination that address specific client needs and expand relationships with our full suite of services and capabilities, fueling our sustained attractive growth over time.<br/>Second, we are committed to enabling and prioritizing choice for our clients as we drive down costs.<br/>And third, we continue to build on our long track record of innovation to drive greater affordability, access, transparency and improved clinical outcomes.<br/>Stepping back, our pharmacy benefit service business is achieving attractive growth because we're able to secure a diverse group of any growing client base, leading with the strength of our supply chain, clinical and care management programs. With our proven model, Express Scripts' client retention rates are consistently in the mid-90s or higher, and we've been able to continuously grow our pipeline and win new business from medium-sized to the largest employers, from local health plans to national players and even the largest government-sponsored programs.<br/>We've expanded our efforts to advocate on behalf of our clients and customers, particularly as it relates to financing models, which are key areas of focus for some of the current legislative proposals. Express Scripts business model starts with the commitment to enabling and prioritizing choice in benefit design and financing options for clients who are the primary financers of their employee benefit programs. This includes providing them the option to finance the cost of their programs by allowing us to share in the discounts we secure on their behalf, be it rebates or spread pricing. Our clients choose amongst these models based upon their needs for managing risk and greater predictability for their pharmacy costs as well as their cash flow.<br/>For context, across the breadth of our Express Scripts pharmacy benefit service portfolio today, over 95% of rebate dollars are passed through to clients. The key point is that each client chooses the financing mechanism that works best for them. They have choices in how they pay for the value we deliver and many find that using rebate sharing or spread pricing generate a stronger level of aligned incentives in addition to being able to plan for predictable cash flow that it generates. Proposes to limit the availability and scope of these options will result in less choice for thousands of employers, health plans and governmental clients we serve and increase their costs over time. <br/>As it relates to Express Scripts, we are confident in our ability to earn sustainable and attractive margins for our services under a variety of legislative scenarios. We are able to create value through the breadth of our capabilities from supply chain to benefit design, driving competition amongst drug manufacturers to bring cost down and deliver better health outcomes through our clinical programs.<br/>One area of focus for multiple stakeholders has been the amount of income we earn for rebate retention and retail spread. To put this in context, we expect about 20% of Evernorth's 2023 pretax adjusted earnings to come from Express Scripts retention of rebates and retail spread. This percentage has trended down over time. and we expect it to continue trending downwards. This is fueled by our ongoing innovation and greater diversification of our Evernorth businesses.<br/>I would also remind you that these financing options that we provide to clients are developed in exchange for lower service fees. So said otherwise, if these programs decrease further over time, fee-based income would increase. Therefore, we are confident that some of these payment vehicles will reduce or remove our regulatory change or client preference. Express Scripts has a broad set of capabilities that create value and will continue to earn an attractive return.<br/>Let me provide some specific examples that reinforce our flexibility and durable model and how we tap into our long track record of innovation for better outcomes on behalf of our customers and clients who are seeking greater affordability and transparency for prescription drugs. First, we are taking several steps to expand transparency. Express Scripts' new ClearCareRx fully demonstrates the flexibility we have for prescription drug benefits, where clients pay exactly what Express Scripts pays pharmacies for prescriptions. They receive 100% of drug rebates that Express Scripts obtains by negotiating with pharmaceutical companies. They pay one service fee to cover the administration of pharmacy benefits, product services, reporting analytics, and the programs supported by a fully audible mechanism. In addition, clients also benefit from guarantees to keep Express Scripts accountable for clinical and financial performance measures including improvements in overall adherence rates and patient outcomes. Additional steps to drive even greater transparency include providing clients with enhanced financial and fee disclosures regarding their spread pricing programs when they exist.<br/>Along with today's release about our first quarter financial results, you will also find additional disclosures we are providing about Express Scripts model in our quarterly regulatory filings and on our new micro site. We will also offer a new digital pharmacy benefit statement for customers, starting in 2024. The statement will share drug pricing information, out-of-pocket costs and the net value delivered by Express Scripts on behalf of customers.<br/>With respect to the broader issue of drug pricing, to be clear, we are fully aligned with lowering cost of prescription drugs for customers. For example, Express Scripts patient assurance program launched in 2019, capped out-of-pocket costs for eligible members of select diabetes and cardiovascular medications. In 2022 alone, customers taking insulin saved more than $18 million because of this program. Now with the introduction of our new co-pay insurance plan, we are taking further action to cap out-of-pocket costs for customers in client prescription drug benefits. At $5 for generic drugs, $25 for preferred brand medications and $45 for preferred specialty medications.<br/>Finally, we also have a series of groundbreaking initiatives to further support pharmacists in the rural communities across the United States. We are offering increased reimbursement to true independent pharmacies and partnering opportunities to expand their clinical practices to further support care needs of the local communities. We are also convening an advisory committee of community pharmacies. These initiatives will encourage better care, expanded access to lower prices for rural Americans as well as increasingly more sustainable revenue stream for independent pharmacists. We are encouraged by how our recent actions have been received by a wide range of stakeholders, including clients, our pharmacy network partners and policymakers. They recognize our commitment as the leader and trusted partner that continues to create value through our deep expertise in designing programs for specific client needs, driving innovation and broadening our reach.<br/>In summary, we are demonstrating our leadership in the competitive pharmacy benefits market that is such a critical building block for the American health care system. We are serving specific client needs through the strength of our model and the effectiveness of our care coordination programs, allowing us to drive sustained attractive growth. We are continuing to advocate for clients and their ability to choose the appropriate programs that work best for the business as we help lower costs. And we are continuing to innovate in driving greater affordability, transparency and improve outcomes for those we serve.<br/>Now let me briefly recap our performance for the quarter and our outlook. In the first quarter, we continued to execute and perform well. We delivered for our customer clients and partners and our business kept our commitment to our shareholders. We delivered adjusted EPS of $5.41 per share, and we're pleased to have increased our full year outlook for adjusted EPS, revenue and customer growth as well as an improved medical care ratio. We are confident in our ability to continue to deliver and capture value into the dynamic and changing environment. We have shaped our business model to navigate varying economic conditions and our differentiated capabilities within Evernorth to provide us with the flexibility to meet unique client needs and potential changes caused by regulatory requirements. Additionally, our business is driving growth that is generating strong cash flows and we are confident that we will further create value through successful and effective capital deployment.<br/>With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.",
			"<strong>Brian C. Evanko</strong>",
			"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review Cigna's first quarter 2023 results and discuss our updated outlook for the full year. We're pleased with our strong start to the year. The first quarter adjusted earnings per share were above our expectations demonstrating focused execution across our high-performing Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare businesses.<br/>Looking at the quarter specifically, some key consolidated financial highlights include revenue growth of 6% to $46.5 billion. After-tax adjusted earnings of $1.6 billion, adjusted earnings per share of $5.41, and cash flow from operations of $5 billion. This performance gives us the confidence to increase our full year adjusted earnings outlook to at least $24.70 per share.<br/>Before I discuss our Evernorth results, I'll build on David's comments regarding our recent announcement to advance transparency around our PBM, and I'll provide incremental details on our earnings drivers. I'd first start with a level setting that of our operating platform. Evernorth makes up approximately 60% of earnings and Cigna Healthcare is about 40%. Within Evernorth, our Express Scripts PBM is a foundational asset with a diverse set of earning sources, including service and administrative fees, clinical programs, and value-based care arrangements, along with retained rebates and retail spread. These earnings sources are a function of the choices made by our clients.<br/>As David referenced, approximately 20% of Evernorth's adjusted pretax earnings are comprised of PBM retained rebates and retail spread. This percentage has decreased over time. As we continue to expand fee-based client relationships and as our Evernorth portfolio becomes more diverse and continues to grow. Importantly, as Evernorth's business mix has changed over the years, margins have remained stable. This speaks to our flexibility to adapt to an ever-changing market and gives us confidence in our ability to navigate disruption in the operating or regulatory environment.<br/>As David mentioned and I would underscore, our foundational PBM asset will continue to create and deliver significant value, which will allow us to sustain growth at attractive competitive returns. Shifting to our current period Evernorth results. First quarter 2023 revenues grew 8% to $36.2 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion, in line with our expectations. Evernorth results in the quarter were driven by continued strong growth in our high-performing specialty pharmacy business and our focus on affordability and delivering lowest net cost solutions for our customers and clients. Additionally, we continue to build our cross-enterprise leverage capabilities, providing an additional avenue for growth as we further deepen our relationships across Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare.<br/>We also continue to make strategic investments, which serve to strengthen and grow our client relationships, expand our portfolio of products and services and advance our digital capabilities. As it relates to our strategic partnerships, we remain on track in our implementation of the Centene contract that begins in 2024. And our collaboration with VillageMD is progressing and provides us an attractive opportunity to further accelerate our value-based care programs and capabilities. We will continue to expand these value-based solutions for the benefit of our Cigna Healthcare, U.S. commercial and U.S. government clients as well as other provider partners and Evernorth health plan clients. Additionally, we remain confident around the multiyear accelerating biosimilar opportunity with high visibility into expected savings for customers and clients in the second half of this year, consistent with our prior expectations and regardless of utilization shifts for product approvals in the market.<br/>Overall, Evernorth continues to perform very well. Our diversified set of earnings streams, along with flexible financing models enable us to innovate and adapt through dynamic environments.<br/>Turning to Cigna Healthcare. First quarter 2023 adjusted revenues grew 12% to $12.7 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.1 billion, slightly above our expectations. The medical care ratio of 81.3% was better than expectations as overall utilization came in slightly favorable. This was reinforced by our clinical engagement models and related affordability initiatives as well as our continued pricing discipline.<br/>Turning to medical customers. We ended the quarter with 19.5 million total medical customers, growth of approximately 1.5 million customers since the end of 2022. This strong growth demonstrates the continued differentiation of our market-leading products and services. Our commercial customers increased 8% year-to-date aided by the addition of a large fee-based health plan client that expands upon an existing Evernorth relationship. And even excluding this client win, we drove organic customer growth across all of our U.S. commercial market segments. <br/>In our U.S. government business, we saw considerable growth in our U.S. Individual and Medicare Advantage customers, with MA growth of 10% on a year-to-date basis. <br/>Overall, Cigna Healthcare is off to a strong start in 2023 as we continue to deliver differentiated value and affordability to our customers and clients. <br/>Across our Evernorth and Cigna Health care platforms, we delivered strong first quarter financial results driven by our diversified portfolio of foundational and accelerated growth businesses, further bolstered by cross enterprise leverage. <br/>Now turning to our outlook for full year 2023. We have increased our expectations for full year 2023 consolidated adjusted revenues to at least $188 billion, enabled by continued growth and deepening customer relationships in Cigna Healthcare and Evernorth. We are also increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook to at least $24.70 per share. <br/>Consistent with our prior commentary, we expect earnings this year to be back-half weighted in large part driven by Evernorth's earnings ramp over the course of the year with second half EPS contributing slightly below 55% of full year EPS.<br/>In Evernorth, we expect continued strong performance, all while investing in growth and innovation. We continue to expect Evernorth full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $6.4 billion. <br/>In Cigna Healthcare, we are raising our medical customer growth expectation to at least 1.3 million customers, an increase of 100,000 lives. We are improving our 2023 medical care ratio outlook to a range of 81.5% to 82.3%. And we are raising our expected full year 2023 adjusted earnings to at least $4.425 billion. <br/>Despite the dynamic macroeconomic environment, we have yet to see material impact to Cigna Healthcare enrollment levels. We remain prudent with respect to our enrollment outlook for the rest of the year as evidenced by our full year guidance relative to the first quarter customer growth results. To be clear, we continue to expect underlying organic employer client growth as we move through the year. And our outlook continues to assume some elevated dis-enrollment in the second half of the year corresponding with some expected softening in the economy. Additionally, as a reminder, our outlook does not contemplate incremental customer growth from Medicaid redeterminations. <br/>Finally, when contemplating the Cigna Group's performance under various future economic scenarios, it's important to keep in mind that we have strategically positioned the company's portfolio of businesses to be more diversified than it was in prior economic downturns. This gives us confidence and resilience to weather dynamic macroeconomic environments. Switching gears.<br/>Let's move to our 2023 capital management position and outlook. Our debt to capitalization ratio is 42.2% as of March 31. We expect to lower this ratio over the balance of the year, and we continue to target a long-term debt to capitalization ratio of approximately 40%. Year-to-date through May 4, 2023, we have repurchased approximately 3.7 million shares of common stock for approximately $1.1 billion. And for full year 2023, we continue to expect at least $9 billion of cash flow from operations. Our balance sheet and our cash flow outlook remains strong benefiting from our highly efficient service-based model that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital. <br/>So now to recap. First quarter results were above our expectations, reflecting strong contributions across our diversified portfolio of complementary businesses. Evernorth continued to deliver strong results with the first quarter in line with our expectations. While Cigna Healthcare had a strong start to the year, giving us confidence to deliver on our increased 2023 EPS guidance of at least $24.70. We continue to expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $28 consistent with our prior commentary. And over the long run, we continue to expect average annual EPS growth of 10% to 13% and are confident in our ability to adapt and navigate the operating and regulatory backdrop with our diversified business mix, and complementary capabilities across Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare.<br/>And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&amp;A portion of the call.",

			"(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ms. Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.",
			"<strong>Lisa Christine Gill</strong>",
			"David, thank you for all the comments around the PBM and profitability, et cetera. I guess my first question is really to understand where do you think the disconnect is from a legislative standpoint versus how the PBMs actually operate? And then secondly, when we think about an employer, it feels to me that a lot of this legislation is going to take away that decision-making by the employer. What are employers saying to you around legislation? What are they saying to you around the selling season? And then also if you can just give us an update as to how you're thinking about the 2024 selling season?",
			"<strong>David Michael Cordani</strong>",
			"Lisa, you put a lot in there and thanks for the questions. Let me try to touch on each. First, as we step back, as I noted, we're quite proud of the results that we have delivered and continue to deliver in view the PBMs using that acronym, but the pharmacy service organizations are the organizations that relentlessly work to improve affordability for the benefit of a broad constituency group. I think to your first question, if we step back, well, we could point to tremendous results in terms of clinical trends, outcome, affordability on average, less than $1 increase in out-of-pocket costs for individuals. We do recognize, and I think this is part of the legislation or the legislative energy, the program still don't work for everyone. So for example, while the programs are designed to generate overall affordability if there's a high deductible plan is an illustration and in the month of January, someone has -- is a deductible and has a significant out-of-pocket for our pharmaceutical experience that creates a financial dislocation for an individual, that's a failure of the system, right? We need to step up to that. We need to innovate because that's an unintended consequence of the failure of a system. So we could talk about the averages that we're proud of from an affordability, but we need to make sure we continue to innovate till it works for everyone or we could talk about the fact that we have leading breadth of network access through our pharmacy networks, coupled with our home delivery, yet when you look at the uniqueness of America, some rural locations may not have the access or accessibility in a specific case. And therefore, the market is not working for those individuals. Hence, you see some of the innovations we step forward out. Our copay assurance program directly goes at the out-of-pocket predictability for individuals under a variety of circumstances. Our rural pharmacy and independent pharmacy initiatives go directly at specific actions to support individuals. So the averages when we sit and look at the data is accepted, we need to do better, and we're stepping forward as a leader to do better from that standpoint. <br/>As it relates to employers, our retention rates and our new business growth rates reinforce the fact that by and large, employers see us as being successful. I would note that our ClearCareRx program that we just rolled out, that was two years in design. And we worked with about a dozen sophisticated large employers to design those programs to work for them and work for us and how we can roll those out and scale. And as we sit here today, we have hundreds of clients together with our Evernorth team and our Express Scripts team talking about future innovation. So there remains high receptivity and high receptivity to the advancements we're making in terms of further transparency in clinical programs, but they like their choice. They like having the choice of financing mechanisms, which were aligned with.<br/>And then finally, maybe just to manage time, on the '24 selling season, '24 will be another year of growth for us in the Evernorth service portfolio. We will see strong retention. As I noted, our retention has historically been in the mid-90s or better we will see strong retention, and we will see good growth as our products and programs resonate in the marketplace. Lisa, thanks for the questions.",

			"<strong>Steven James Valiquette</strong>",
			"So regarding the Evernorth results in the first quarter, you mentioned they were in line with the expectations. Just with the script volume, though being down, just curious to get more color on that? And also, I know you're not giving script volume guidance for the full year, but just curious if the trends in the first quarter are good run rates for the full year?",

			"Steve, it's Brian. Yes. As I mentioned earlier, our Evernorth results are very much in line with expectations for the quarter. One thing that's important to keep in mind, David mentioned 40% of the revenue in Evernorth now is derived from our Specialty Pharmacy business. And as you can appreciate, the Specialty Pharmacy script counts end up being dwarfed by the generics and the higher-volume script counts that come through the PBM. So it's a little bit misleading to look at the aggregate script counts for those reasons. And I'd note our -- the revenue in the Specialty Pharmacy grew mid-teens year-over-year. So it was a very strong grower. You saw strong script growth in specialty, but again, it was dwarfed by the big picture of the PBM generic volumes moving around a bit. And as you think about the overall script counts year-on-year, think of the client mix changes that occurred from '22 to '23 is driving a good bit of that. and that really drove the kind of flattish all-in script counts.<br/>Now as we look forward to '24, obviously, we prepare to onboard. Centene, you'll see a meaningful step-up in that metric. But as I mentioned earlier, with the specialty pharmacy growing at such an attractive rate, it's a bit masked when you look purely to script count metrics. So hopefully, that helps a bit. And when you put all those pieces together, we're getting confident and comfortable with the full year outlook in terms of Evernorth income.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Mr. Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.",
			"<strong>Nathan Allen Rich</strong>",
			"I wanted to go back to the PBM and the regulatory focus, David. You mentioned that not all pharmacy benefit designs work for everyone. And the target, I think, of much of the legislation is focused on lowering out-of-pocket cost for patients. You've had plan options in the past that address some of these areas. I know you said that clients like having that choice. But are there -- is there any middle ground in terms of different solutions that you couldn't maybe roll out more broadly that would address some of these pain points kind of proactively ahead of maybe being forced legislatively? And I guess kind of my follow-up to that is client preferences, I think kind of changed relatively slowly over time. I guess if we did see legislation go in place, how quickly could you kind of shift the client -- shift clients to new payment models to kind of adjust to a new regulatory backdrop?",
			"<strong>David Michael Cordani</strong>",
			"So first, on the affordability in the out-of-pocket, choice has been in the marketplace for some time. And important to note, by and large, as I noted before, on average, those programs are working well in terms of the balance of overall affordability. And plan sponsors make trade-offs in terms of how much is put in premiums, how much is put in the benefits, et cetera, from that standpoint. Two, just pointing you to specific because you said actions we could take. In 2019, we rolled out the first of its kind, the patient assurance program for insulin-dependent diabetics, cap monthly costs at $25 will stop. There's 11 million people benefiting from that program today as you see more focus relative to insulin. So we can have and will from that standpoint. <br/>Second, as you click down because, in many cases, the devils in the details, as you roll out new programs, you learned that, for example, some of the copay assurance programs can work in an HRA program, but in some cases, don't work in an HSA program because of the regulatory requirement of the HSA program. They'll only work for preventative drugs, but they won't work for a broader class of drugs. So that now enables us to be more consultative with employers to make sure there's even a more pinpointed focus on benefit design and communication strategies as open enrollment happens because in some cases, an individual will enroll in an HSA, yet learn later that they have more dislocation in their out-of-pocket costs in a given month from the copay. So my point is actions taken, actions being taken, more precision that is necessary from that standpoint. <br/>As it relates to the -- how quickly we could pivot, we've proven tremendous flexibility in our model. Some of the additional data we're providing, we noted even last year at our Investor Day, we would continue to push ourselves with expanded disclosures and you're seeing more and more. We can pivot, we will pivot, we will continue to offer choice and the tools exist today as exemplary with our ClearCareRx program to provide further choice that use different financing mechanisms. So we are confident that we will be able to flex rapidly, if necessary. But we want to also ensure that we are a voice for employers to still work to preserve choices for them as how they want to finance their programs, how they want to manage their overall cost and predictability from that standpoint. But to reassure you, we have ample flexibility to flex rapidly.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Mr. A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.",
			"<strong>Albert J. William Rice</strong>",
			"I guess I'll try to pivot away from the PBM question. In the prepared remarks, you mentioned your ongoing discussions with VillageMD about putting in place value-based contracting. I wonder if you can give us any further update on that? When you start to think about your '24 bids commercially or an MA, will any of those arrangements be part of the package that you offer or a factor in your bids and -- so it's I'm asking about '24 anything on the MA final rate notice and whether that changes your view on growth or margin trajectory that you're on in MA?",
			"<strong>David Michael Cordani</strong>",
			"You tucked a lot of questions in there, but let me start from the top. Relative to value-based care, before I get to Village first, we've had a long commitment and positive track record relative to value-based care programs. our orientation, as you may recall, is oriented around partnering, using data in collaborating with additional care extended resources to drive better, more consistent clinical outcomes and, therefore, overall value. Today, think about order of magnitude approaching 75% of our MA lives are in a value-based program. And depending on what you're looking at commercial or individual exchange, 40% or 50% of lives benefiting from the value-based program. And I'd underscore we're seeing benefits from that in our continued market-leading lower medical cost trend. <br/>Specific to Village, we're pleased to advance and even further partnering more deeply with Village and collaborating with them. There are many ways in which we'll collaborate with Village to further accelerate value-based care traction off of their already successful model. I would note and highlight one of the portions that we are really excited about with Village is they've proven their current value-based care approach for commercial as well as Medicare Advantage. And our model with them has the ability to design and benefit from not only commercial and Medicare Advantage, but ASO and guaranteed cost as we bring more Evernorth services and collaborate with them as we curate more specialty networks, et cetera, going forward. <br/>As it relates to the part of your question, are there benefits in our current pricing as a result of our village initiative, they are starting to yield benefits already starting to contribute to pricing in specific markets where the initiatives are underway, is the headline. <br/>As it relates to your last question relative to big strategy, rate notice, et cetera, you should think about our view is, our net rate for 2024 approximates the industry average. We take all the puts and takes that are framed in. <br/>Secondly, as you know, we're in the latter part of the bid cycle right now, so it would be premature and inappropriate for me to speak in any depth relative to our specific pricing strategy for 2024. We're pleased with our growth in 2023. We're pleased to see the 10% that we yielded to date and the traction in some of our markets that are maturing, and we will work on a market-by-market basis relative to the bid strategies and look forward to updates as we get into the second half of the year. Thanks, A.J.",

			"Our next question comes from Mr. Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.",
			"<strong>Justin Lake</strong>",
			"And I'll just echo how much we appreciate the comments on the PBM transparency there. I wanted to follow up with a couple of things on the PBM. The first is -- and so 20% of your profits come from those spread contracts and rebates. If the government did price did pass what they're talking about this year, how would -- how are your contracts structured such that you could pivot away? Is that something that would have to happen over time? What would the near-term impact be versus the longer term? <br/>And then secondly, I've gotten a lot of questions on 340B given one of your peers talked about is a pretty meaningful headwind versus their expectations this year. So curious if you can give us some color there in terms of maybe what percentage of earnings come from 340B or how your outlook has changed there within your [Express scripts PBM]?",
			"<strong>David Michael Cordani</strong>",
			"Justin, I'm going to take your questions. It's David. I'll take your questions in reverse order. Specific to 340B, we've seen some recent extrapolation of what potential exposure could be for us based upon what some others said or the size of certain other programs. I would start by saying we think those estimates are overstated. <br/>So now let me step back. By way of context, we do believe the 340B represents an important series of capabilities, in many cases, for hospitals to benefit from more affordable pharmaceuticals for underserved populations. Some pharmaceutical manufacturers have unilaterally removed or made it much more difficult for those hospitals to engender those benefits. By way of context, we saw deceleration, some deceleration in our volumes in the first half of 2022. We saw that deceleration trough mid-'22 and we saw volumes begin to increase in the second half of '22 is different data sharing and other activities move forward. <br/>As it relates to our impact, we have factored into our plan for the year. and our most recent updated outlook for the year, our best estimate, which includes some dampening of the overall program as it relates to our results, but I would stress some of these extrapolations based on the size of certain other programs, we think is overstated. This is manageable within our portfolio and not a material driver of the overall Evernorth portfolio.<br/>As it relates to your first question, which I really appreciate, Justin, I can't give you a precise answer to your question. If we take a theoretical and say that legislation is passed tomorrow, that creates an immediacy, which we do believe will transpire. In fact, if you could look at some of the most recent dialogue coming out of committees and otherwise for the consideration of consideration of consideration being implemented in the latter half of 2025, for example, we don't think that theoretical exists. Having said that, you should think that we have contractual by and large, contractual frameworks that take into consideration unanticipated immediate legislative or regulatory movement. We don't believe that is the case. We will continue to advocate for our clients. We will continue to work to ensure that choice exists. And as we made clear, even with our ClearCareRx program, we have the tools and flexibility to deliver what a client wants from a choice standpoint, with or without sharing and being able to earn a sustained attractive margin for the value we create. Thanks, Justin.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Ms. Erin Wright, Morgan Stanley.",
			"<strong>Erin Elizabeth Wilson Wright</strong>",
			"You mentioned some elevated dis-enrollment in the second half embedded in your guidance from a softening economy and -- can you quantify that range? Or how are you thinking about that? And what are you seeing now? And how did that change relative to what you were anticipating previously?",
			"<strong>Brian C. Evanko</strong>",
			"Erin, it's Brian. So first of all, I just would reiterate, we're really pleased with the strong growth momentum across the Cigna Healthcare portfolio. When you think of -- our U.S. commercial Medicare Advantage and our U.S. individual business is all showing strong year-to-date results running ahead of expectations in aggregate for enrollment levels. And that builds upon our really strong performance in '22, where we added nearly 1 million customers across the Cigna Healthcare platform. As I mentioned, we are not yet seeing signs of economic pressure in our book, for example, the dis-enrollment levels in the most recent months are very much in line with historical norms. But as I mentioned, we have assumed some level of elevated dis-enrollment in the back half of the year in order to be prudent. And in addition to that, we typically see some in-year attrition within the U.S. individual book over the course of a given calendar year. And as I mentioned, we still see organic growth in net client counts in the U.S. commercial business, particularly as the Select segment continues its sales cycle through the balance of the year. <br/>And finally, we have not yet incorporated any assumption of potential volume for Medicaid redetermination. So that represents pure upside for us. And so should we not see economic weakness transpire later in the year? Or should we pick up some unexpected customers from the Medicaid redeterminations? We may have some upside in our Cigna Healthcare customer accounts. <br/>Final comment I'll give you just in terms of sensitivities. In prior economic downturns, we've seen for every 1% change in the unemployment rate, our commercial employer levels enrollment levels will move by either 0.5% to 1% as it relates to 1% move in the unemployment rate. So it gives you a sense for the sensitivity relative to the size of the book as you think about how to model the rest of the year.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.",
			"<strong>Kevin Mark Fischbeck</strong>",
			"Great. it seems like cost trend really wasn't a problem for you in the quarter, but still after earnings season is basically over, still trying to reconcile the strong numbers from the providers and the med tech companies with a relatively solid numbers from the managed care industry. Can you help reconcile what seems to be an apparent conflict? And any color on cost trend, particularly, I guess, through the quarter and into this quarter would be helpful.",
			"<strong>Brian C. Evanko</strong>",
			"Kevin, it's Brian. So just a few thoughts for you in terms of the reconciliation to the provider side, et cetera. I'd start by saying we're pleased to having delivered another strong quarter here of MCR performance in line or better than expected. So I'm pleased to start the year in that position. You can think of that as a function of the strong progress we've made in recent years with our affordability initiatives. So that includes items such as our provider contracting improvements, clinical program evolution, [site] care optimization, along with our continued pricing discipline. So all that served us well, all while allowing us to grow 1.5 million customers year-to-date. <br/>As you think about the first quarter specifically, the favorability that we saw was driven by lighter-than-expected viral or respiratory claims. So in this case, think of COVID, flu, RSV in aggregate, running a little bit lower than what we had been expecting. Now on the nonviral side, we had planned in price or normalized utilization levels to transpire in 2023. And that were more consistent with pre-COVID levels. And during the first quarter, that's what we saw. We saw nonviral utilization, reflecting this more normalized pattern. But again, this was in line with our expectations that we had planned and price for stepping into the year.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Mr. Gary Taylor with Cowen.",
			"<strong>Gary Paul Taylor</strong>",
			"Quick question. I do appreciate the PBM disclosure because obviously, if you're talking about 10% to 15% of the company's total earnings that you expect to retain? It seems like the down 26% stock price is quite overdone this year. So I appreciate that. Are we going to see some of that financial disclosure in the 10-Q when you talk about new disclosure? Will that be around some of the economics of retained spread in rebate?<br/>And then my second question is we did see the Florida all pass or I believe, is going to be signed or just was signed by the governor that would prohibit spread pricing in Florida across all lines of business. And just wondered what the -- if you knew what the implementation date on that was and just how quickly you had to sort of move to address that employer?",
			"<strong>Brian C. Evanko</strong>",
			"Gary, it's Brian. I'll take your first question. I think David will comment on the situation that you referenced in Florida. As it relates to the incremental disclosures. So really, those were designed today to give all of our investors some further context on the earnings sources within Evernorth, just given the amount of misinformation in the ecosystem. And so alongside our 10-Q that we filed today, you'll find a supplemental disclosure that provides some additional qualitative information as well as some metrics that we think are important to help various stakeholders understand what the PBM does and doesn't do. And hopefully, we find that investors look at that as useful information. <br/>As it relates to some of the additional data points David and I shared, for example, the 20% of pre-tax adjusted earnings associated with PBM retained rebates and spread. As we referenced, that percentage has declined over time. At this point, we're not necessarily intending to update that every quarter in the Q, but we will obviously give you context for how the earnings sources are evolving over time as that business continues to grow. David, do you want to comment on the...",
			"<strong>David Michael Cordani</strong>",
			"Sure, rich. Gary, relative to the Florida activity, one of the two components we talked about. We talked about rebates. This is specific to your question relative to spread. We're still working through the details from a state standpoint. Interesting timing as well. We literally have our large client gathering that is taking place as we speak. This is a topic of discussion for clients in terms of digesting the ramifications. We'll have the ability to flex our capabilities as I noted in prior questions relative to this one aspect as it's implemented. I don't want to go any further in terms of quantifying or otherwise. Big picture, it's manageable. Specifically, we'll work through client by client, the impacts relative to their respective Florida footprint and then considerations on a go-forward basis as to whether or not they want to flex financing mechanisms for other geographies going forward, using our capabilities. But we have the ability to flex, and we will be compliant, obviously, with the implementation time line.",

			"Our next question comes from Mr. Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.",
			"<strong>Stephen C. Baxter</strong>",
			"Yes, I wanted to ask about ClearCareRx. I guess, first, how quickly do you think this model will be adopted? Is there any kind of target for this that you can share? And then obviously, your clients are sophisticating of access to pools to evaluate your economics during RFPs. But how do you think about competitive dynamics of the industry as a whole over time could be progressing to explicit fee-based pricing models?",
			"<strong>David Michael Cordani</strong>",
			"Stephen, the ClearCareRx program, as I noted previously, we've worked for about two years with a small number, think of a dozen large sophisticated clients to design this program to work through the program to perfect aspects of the program, and we're excited to roll it out on a more extensive basis. Two, I would think about the addressable market as more the larger of the large clients working down given the immediacy of pass-through and then the potential cash flow management ramifications that it creates from that standpoint. So this will be another choice that's offered in the marketplace. <br/>I think to your broader question -- inferred to your broader question, the relentless of ongoing commitment to innovation is mission-critical in any industry. In this subset of our industries, it's mission-critical. And we're proud of the fact that we had leadership relative to a variety of programs. As I mentioned, insulin programs, as we talked before about our Embark program on high-cost gene therapies, our SafeGuardRx program, that is benefiting all of our clients relative to care management programs. TRCs, as you know, more therapeutic resource groups and centers that come together and focus on specific diagnosis and have detailed expertise and then how they're coordinated with the medical professionals and how they coordinated with the behavioral professionals are mission critical. So the path of innovation and whether it is, to your point, a fee-based environment that transpires may transpire. However, having the choice, we think, is mission critical. <br/>Finally, for you and maybe the broader audience, we may see some similarities as we've seen in the medical space where as you think about our approach, I mean, the medical benefit space, our approach was broad funding mechanisms and financing mechanisms, an agnostic model, meaning we could flex in any of them, whether it's self-funded, self-funded with stop loss on risk management, a share return model or a guaranteed cost model. And we see those same trends manifesting in the pharmacy space, and we're in a position to lead there. So largest of large employers, 2 years in its design, it's perfected and it's ready to scale. We don't think the entire market shifts to this in 2024. We think there'll be more adoption of programs like ClearCareRx, and we're happy to be the leader in the space.",

			"Our next question comes from Mr. Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.",
			"<strong>Joshua Richard Raskin</strong>",
			"I was wondering if you could give us some more color on the individual book. It looks like it came in maybe 100,000 or so more than expected. Maybe where did those lives come from? And was that the reason for the increased total membership guidance? And then maybe any early signs on utilization and other metrics that give you comfort that you price that business correctly?",
			"<strong>Brian C. Evanko</strong>",
			"Josh, it's Brian. So overall, the strong individual customer growth in 2023, you can think of as a combination of a few things. So one, obviously, the industry had some strong growth rates from '22 to '23. We also had some new market entries and there were some competitors that exited certain geographies where we participate in. And if you think about the sources of that, our growth came from a combination of existing geographies and those three new states that we stepped into, which were Texas, Indiana and South Carolina here in 2023. We did see the majority of our growth come from three states in particular. So Texas, Georgia and Florida drove the majority of the growth not any one specific city because we're in multiple locations in those states. Fortunately, we have a long history in these geographies that goes well beyond the U.S. individual business, meaning our commercial and MA businesses has been operating in those locations for some time. So our provider engagement and clinical programs should benefit these individual customers as well.<br/>Now for purposes of the claims experience and the margins, et cetera, for the '23 calendar year, we continue to expect the margins on this book will run below our long-term goal, which is 4% to 6% in our Cigna Health care income and MCR guidance reflects this. So we expect to run below that 4% to 6% long-term goal given the substantial amount of new customers we've added in 2023, we think this is a prudent assumption to make from the standpoint of the margin running below that long-term target. <br/>While it's early in the year so far, the claims are largely in line with our expectations through the first quarter. And importantly, as you think about the first quarter actuals as well as our full year outlook, we've assumed that we will be in a risk adjustment payable position for the 2023 plan year despite the fact that we were in a receivable position for the 2022 plan year. So again, we think that's a prudent assumption to make at this early juncture in the year until later. And in 2023 when we see some industry-wide risk adjustment data that will help us to recalibrate that assumption. As you think about the longer run, this is a book of business that does represent a source of future embedded earnings power that will help contribute to the segment's long-term margin expansion and income growth. So overall, a good start to the year. Still a long way to go for the full year, and we think we've taken a prudent posture as it relates to the accruals.",

			"I would be interested if you could maybe just drill in a bit more into your latest thinking on both the GLP-1 drugs and then the emerging Alzheimer's drugs, maybe give us just some insights from both the Cigna Healthcare and Evernorth business segment perspective?",
			"<strong>David Michael Cordani</strong>",
			"Scott, it's David. Clearly, the GLP-1 drugs have been in the price pretty significantly. And by way of headline, we think the drugs and the treatment protocols represent a positive step forward. specifically for diabetics as such. We have coverage within our formulary. I would remind you that early on when the first within the class came out, we actually stepped in with some value-based care arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers and have seen positive contributions for both the benefit of patients as well as our clients. But to date, I'd also add that employers have had a more limited appetite to expand coverage beyond clinical diagnoses such as diabetes for certain lifestyle treatments. There has been some, but we've seen more limited adoption of that thus far. And on a go-forward basis, we would expect to have our P&amp;T committee and our internal clinical oversight continue to monitor the progress relative to ongoing testing development in this important class. I would take that trend and carry it across similarly relative to the Alzheimer's space, clearly, a lot of interest excitement and demand for drugs within the Alzheimer's space to help a growing population confronting this challenging disease from that standpoint. We've seen more limited adoption thus far. We see some early data like you're seeing right now relative to next-in-class [drugs] seeming to demonstrate some promise going through FDA, working through CMS relative to Medicare reimbursement, and we will stay tightly aligned relative to that.<br/>On a final note, if you put a circle around this, I think you've heard in the latter part of your question, you can think about these drugs is, in some cases, creating cost on the benefit side of the equation with an offset of a benefit, clearly. But you should also think about the Cigna Group's portfolio because of Evernorth is having some dimension of a natural hedge given the size and sophistication and reach of our pharmacy and specialty pharmacy programs and the breadth of the clients we're able to serve within that portfolio. So we see this as a growth opportunity within the Evernorth portfolio and the clinical depth we have in there in terms of coordinating services for individuals will be helpful in terms of ensuring that the value is delivered. <br/>So emerging space in both categories, some promise, early adoption, some track record in value-based care. And importantly, I would underscore, we have a natural hedge relative to some cost pressure you would think about in the benefit space through our high-performing services space.",

			"Our last question comes from Kevin -- Mr. Kevin Caliendo with UBS.",
			"<strong>Kevin Caliendo</strong>",
			"Great. Getting back to the 20% of Evernorth earnings, does that include the ESI rebates and pass-through and spread? Does that also account for the medical profit like the pharmacy profit in the Medical segment as well? Or is that separate? And since you've been in such a giving mood, can you provide us -- is there any transparency on that number?",
			"<strong>Brian C. Evanko</strong>",
			"Kevin, it's Brian. So the 20% that we made reference to is the PBM retained rebates and the retail spread that comprise the Evernorth segment's contribution specifically. So as with all of our clients of Evernorth, whether they be the Cigna Healthcare affiliated health plan or our unaffiliated health plan clients, they choose how they would like to use the pharmacy value that we create for them. So to your question, if there are pharmacy earnings in the Cigna Healthcare segment, that's not reflected in the 20% metric we're specifically dimensioning the Evernorth contribution. And then like I said, the Cigna Healthcare health plan decides how they choose to deploy any value that's created from Evernorth's sister company. David, maybe you want to pile on here?",
			"<strong>David Michael Cordani</strong>",
			"And Kevin to add on that, as you think about the health plans that are served by Evernorth, if you consider the total cost of care, a health plan through their medical contracting, ancillary contracting, pharmacy contract behavioral contracting, aggregate a total cost of care to generate their price point. So in the case of a guaranteed cost offering or a risk-based offering, the cost of the pharmaceuticals are baked into that from that standpoint, whether that's commercial, individual exchange business. or Medicare Advantage business for health plan. So that's value delivered just like the value that's delivered for their medical contracting, their DME contracting, their behavioral contracting, et cetera, and part of their overall cost equation that they'll factor into the net pricing that they're offering to the marketplace.",

Librela is the first and only once-monthly, anti-NGF monoclonal antibody treatment for canine OA pain and is approved as safe and effective in providing long-term control of OA pain symptoms in dogs, which can improve their mobility and overall quality of life. <sup>1,2</sup>",
			"<b>The Unmet Need in Canine OA</b>",
			"Canine OA is a painful and progressive disease that is highly prevalent. In studies, 40% of dogs have signs of OA.<sup>3,4</sup> With an estimated 86 million dogs living in the U.S. households, a high percentage of dogs are likely experiencing OA pain.<sup>5</sup> OA does not only impact older dogs – it affects dogs of all ages, sizes, and breeds.<sup>6</sup> OA can affect any dog, even as young as 1 year old.",
			"The pain of OA can impact a dog’s physical and emotional health. Signs of OA include, but are not limited to, difficulty in going up or down stairs, lagging behind on walks, hesitation to jump up or down, limping after exercise and becoming more withdrawn.",
			"Despite the prevalence of OA pain in dogs in the U.S., only 33% with OA are actively being treated.<sup>7</sup> Failure to treat canine OA can result in increased pain, decreased mobility and a significant impact on dogs’ overall health and well-being.<sup>8</sup> Current treatment choices have limitations, including lack of effectiveness, difficulty in administration and safety concerns, which contribute to the overall low treatment rate for OA pain.<sup>9</sup> With once-monthly injections administered by a veterinary professional, Librela may also reduce pet owner stress about missing a daily treatment dose and help maintain the human-animal bond.",
			"\"Zoetis has a 25-year legacy in pain management and has revolutionized how the veterinary industry approaches this critical area of pet care,\" said Laura Olsen, Senior Vice President, U.S. Petcare, at Zoetis. \"The FDA approval of Librela represents a significant step forward in our ability to provide comfort to dogs living with the chronic pain associated with OA, ultimately strengthening the unbreakable bond people share with their pets.\"",
			"<b>Clinical Trial Results</b>",
			"Librela represents a new era in pain management as the first monoclonal antibody approved in the U.S to control OA pain in dogs. This once monthly injection works differently from other pain medications – it’s unique mode of action targets Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), a key component of OA pain.",
			"In two field studies, dogs administered Librela as a monthly injection demonstrated a reduction in OA pain compared to dogs that received the placebo and by reducing pain, Librela was shown to help their mobility and overall quality of life.<sup>10</sup> While effectiveness may not be seen until after the second dose of Librela, some dogs may experience a reduction in pain as early as seven days after the first dose.<sup>10</sup> Additionally, in a continuation study, dogs treated with bedinvetmab experienced lasting OA pain relief over the course of the study with monthly injections.<sup>10</sup>",
			"\"Pain is often overlooked in dogs for two primary reasons: the signs of OA pain are misinterpreted as normal aging and OA pain is not considered in younger dogs,\" said Dr. Duncan Lascelles, Professor of Translational Research in Pain and Surgery at North Carolina State University and recent past Chair of the WSAVA Global Pain Council. \"As our understanding of canine pain expands, Librela provides a unique monthly treatment to control OA pain in dogs by targeting NGF, helping to improve their comfort, mobility and overall well-being.\"",
			"Adverse events were similar to what would be expected for this population of dogs with OA. The most common adverse events reported in dogs treated with Librela included urinary tract infections, bacterial skin infections, dermatitis and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN).*",
			"<b>Positive Clinical Experience Reported from European Veterinarians</b>",
			"Librela was granted marketing authorization by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020 and the product was launched in 2021. Librela has been used by veterinarians in Europe for more than two years as a treatment option for OA pain in dogs with over 4.6 million doses distributed.<sup>11</sup> European veterinarians who have used Librela rated their overall satisfaction 8.6 out of 10, the highest of any OA pain medication evaluated.<sup>12</sup> European veterinarians who have used Librela also rated Librela very highly on top product attributes for OA pain medications, including: reduces OA pain, improves mobility, and improves quality-of-life.<sup>12</sup>",
			"<b>About Librela™ (bedinvetmab injection)</b>",
			"Librela is a monoclonal antibody therapy administered in the clinic that targets Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) to control canine OA pain. Librela functions like naturally produced antibodies and is metabolized and eliminated via normal protein degradation pathways with minimal involvement of the liver or kidneys.<sup>13</sup> Librela also has been approved for use in Canada, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and other markets across South America and Asia. Librela is expected to be available to veterinarians in the U.S. in late 2023.

			"The adjusted EPS excludes certain non-recurring expenses like the amortization of intangibles and acquisition-related costs/licensing.",
			"Without adjustments, the company registered a GAAP EPS of 48 cents, a 29.7% increase from the year-ago figure.",
			"Worldwide sales in the quarter under review totaled $276.7 million, up 20% year over year (increased 21% at Constant Exchange Rate). The reported figure exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.9%.",

			"Through its product category, Musculoskeletal Solutions generated revenues of $251.6 million, up 15.7% year over year. Growth was led primarily by the company’s spine business, driven by strong procedural volumes both in the United States and internationally, driven by continued share uptake as well as favorable comps year over year.",
			"Enabling Technologies' product revenues of $25.1 million in the quarter improved 90.8% from the prior-year figure. The significant year-over-year surge was driven by ongoing demand for the company’s robotics and imaging system technologies.",
			"Globus Medical, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Globus Medical, Inc. Quote",
			"The gross profit in the reported quarter rose 20.1% year over year to $205.8 million. The gross margin expanded 7 basis points (bps) to 74.4%.",
			"SG&amp;A expenses in the reported quarter were $122.4 million, up 21.5% from the year-ago quarter. The increase reflected higher personnel-related expenses, primarily driven by sales compensation, as well as higher meetings, travel and training expenses. Research and development expenses decreased 21.1% to $21.1 million.",
			"The quarter’s adjusted operating profit rose massively to $62.4 million, up 17.2% from the year-ago quarter. However, the adjusted operating margin contracted 55 bps in the quarter to 22.5%.",

The transaction, which is expected to close in mid-2023, reflects both companies’ vision to improve patient care through innovation in unmet clinical needs.",
			"The company has reaffirmed its 2023 guidance.",
			"With the planned purchase in the picture, full-year net sales are projected to be $1.1 billion, indicating 7.5% growth compared with the previous year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is also currently pegged at $1.1 billion.",

			"Globus Medical exited the first quarter of 2023 with earnings and revenue beat. The robust growth of organic revenues in both the United States and the international market is impressive. Rapid market interest and customer demand have positioned Excelsius3D, the company’s latest addition to the Excelsius Ecosystem, as a major growth driver in 2023.",
			"According to GMED, this above-market growth is driven by competitive rep recruiting from prior quarters, robotic pull-through and the normalization of post-COVID procedures on a year-over- year basis. In the first quarter, the company launched the MARS TLIF pedicle-based retractor as part of its focus on procedural efficiency to offer specialized options to meet surgeon preferences.",

			"<strong>Insulet Corporation </strong>PODD reported adjusted earnings of 23 cents per share for first-quarter 2023, down 42.5% from the year-ago period’s reported earnings of 40 cents.",
			"First-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings however exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings by 155.6%.",
			"The quarter’s adjustment excludes a charge of $8 million associated with a voluntary medical device correction notice issued to replace the Omnipod DASH Personal Diabetes Managers.",
			"GAAP EPS was 34 cents compared with 40 cents per share in the year-ago period.",
			"Revenues in the first quarter totaled $358.1 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.5%. Moreover, the top line jumped 21.2% from the year-ago quarter’s number (up 23.3% at the constant exchange rate or CER). Quarterly revenues exceeded the company’s previous growth expectations of 11-14% at CER.",
			"Insulet’s Total Omnipod revenues of $357.6 million reflected an increase of 32.7% year over year (up 34.9% at CER). International Omnipod revenues of $98.6 million rose 3.4% (up 9.6% at CER). U.S. Omnipod revenues grew 48.8% year over year to $259 million.",
			"The Drug Delivery business revenues totaled $0.5 million, down 98.1% year over year.",
			"Gross profit in the reported quarter was $241.5 million, up 14.7% from the prior-year quarter. Gross margin of 67.2% contracted a significant 383 basis points.",
			"Selling, general &amp; administrative expenses rose 26.4% to $162.7 million. Research and development expenses rose 16.2% year over year to $50.1 million.",

			"Insulet has updated its guidance for 2023.",
			"For 2023, the company has raised its revenue growth guidance to the range to 18-22%(from the earlier band of 14-19%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $1.52 billion.",
			"Insulet’s Total Omnipod revenue growth is now expected in the range of 21-25% (17-22%). The company reaffirmed its expectation of Drug Delivery revenues to fall in the range of 45-55%.",
			"For the second quarter of 2023, Insulet projects revenue growth of 27-30%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $361.1 million.",
			"Total Omnipod revenues are likely to grow 29-32%. However, Drug Delivery revenues are expected to fall in the range of 20-25%.",
			"Insulet exited the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company’s performance benefited from record first-quarter U.S. revenue growth of 49% and total Omnipod growth of 35%. The company delivered a record first quarter in terms of United States and global new customer starts. Omnipod 5 continued to be a driving force of Insulet’s strong U.S. growth and in the first quarter, representing almost 95% of the company’s U.S. new customer starts.",
			"However, the substantial fall in Drug Delivery sales is discouraging. Contraction in margins does not bode well. On a year-over-year basis, the company expects gross margin to be impacted by higher costs associated with the U.S. manufacturing ramp, product line mix due to the ramp-up of Omnipod 5 and lower drug delivery revenues. Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures continue to challenge business operations.",

			"The first-quarter loss included stock-based compensation expenses, unrealized gain on equity securities and loss on extinguishment of debt. Excluding these items, the adjusted loss was $1.06 per share, narrower than the adjusted loss of $1.49 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. The adjusted loss was also narrower than our estimate of $1.84 per share.",
			"Alnylam recorded total revenues of $319 million in the quarter, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $308 million. In the year-ago quarter, total revenues were $213 million. Net product revenues were $276.3 million, up 48% year over year on a reported basis and 52% at constant exchange rate (CER), driven by increased patient demand for Givlaari (givosiran), Oxlumo (lumasiran) and the newly approved Amvuttra (vutrisiran). Total revenues beat our estimate of $283.4 million in the reported quarter as well.",
			"Net revenues from collaborators were $36.5 million, up 41% from $25.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Primary drivers were an increase in revenues recognized in connection with licensed programs within the collaboration, as well as increased reimbursable activities with <strong>Regeneron</strong> REGN.

			"Alnylam is entitled to receive license fees from these collaboration agreements.",
			"During the first quarter, Alnylam recorded royalty revenues of $6.5 million, primarily due to increased royalties from third parties driven by sales of Amvuttra. In the year-ago quarter, Alnylam recorded royalty revenues of $0.4 million from NVS.",

Oxlumo sales also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25 million and missed our estimate of $25.1 million.",

			"<strong>Operator:</strong> Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the First Quarter 2023 Novo Nordisk A/S Earnings Conference Call. . Please be advised that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, CEO, Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen. Please go ahead.",
			"<strong>Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen:</strong> Thank you, operator. Welcome to this Novo Nordisk earnings call for the first three months of 2023. Today's announcement discloses the full set of results, following the release of top-line results and updated outlook earlier in April. This was shared ahead of time due to Danish securities regulations. My name is Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, and I'm the CEO of Novo Nordisk. With me today, I have Executive Vice President and Head of Commercial Strategy and Corporate Affairs, Camilla Sylvest; Executive Vice President and Head of North America Operations, Doug Langa; Executive Vice President and Head of Development, Martin Holst Lange; and finally, Chief Financial Officer, Karsten Munk Knudsen. All of us will be available for the Q&amp;A session.",
			"Today's announcement and the slides for this call are available on our website, novonordisk.com. Please note that this call is being webcasted live, and a recording will be made available on our website as well. The call is scheduled to last one hour. Please turn to the next slide. The presentation is structured as outlined on Slide 2. Please note that all sales and operating profit growth statements will be at constant exchange rate unless otherwise specified. As always, I need to advise you that this call will contain forward-looking statements such as subject to risks and uncertainty that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For further information on the risk factors, please see the company announcement for the first three months of 2023 and the slides prepared for this presentation.",
			"Please turn to the next slide. In the first three months of 2023, we delivered 25% sales growth and 28% operating profit growth. Furthermore, we raised the outlook for the year in the early announcement shared on April 30, 2023 -- 13th of 2033. I'd like to start this call by going through the performance highlights across our strategic aspirations before handing over the word to my colleagues. Within purpose and sustainability, we continue to make progress across all dimensions. Our carbon emissions decreased by 21% compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019. In line with our strategic aspirations of being a sustainable employer, we continue to expand the number of women in senior leadership positions. This is now 39% compared to 37% end of March 2022.",
			"Within R&amp;D, we are pleased with the successful completion of PIONEER PLUS trial with oral semaglutide 25 and 50 milligram that is setting the bar for all incretins in Type 2 diabetes. Martin will come back to this and our overall R&amp;D milestones later. Within rare endocrine disorders, we are happy to announce the once-weekly Sogroya was approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of children with growth hormone deficiency. This is an important milestone for patients and for the rare disease portfolio. Quarterly sales growth reflects solid commercial execution across operating units. Both operating units contributed to sales growth driven by demand for our GLP-1 treatments for both diabetes and obesity. In the U.S., the prescription trends for Wegovy highlights the high unmet need for people living with obesity.",
			"Camilla and Doug will go through the details per therapy area later. Karsten will go through the financials, but I'm very pleased with the performance so far this year. With that, I'll give the word to Camilla for an update on execution.",
			"<strong>Camilla Sylvest:</strong> Thank you, Lars, and please turn to the next slide. As Lars mentioned, our total sales increased by 25% in the first three months of 2023. This sales increase was driven by both operating units, with North America Operations growing by 41% and international operations growing 10%. Sales growth was positively impacted by U.S. wholesaler inventory movements. Our GLP-1 sales increased 50%, driven by North America growing 50% and international operations growing 52%. Insulin sales decreased by 11%, driven by an 8% decline in international operations and an 18% sales decline in North America operations. Insulin sales in international operations were impacted by the implementation of volume-based procurement in China in May 2022.",
			"Obesity care sales grew 124% overall. In international operations, sales grew 65%, driven by both Saxenda and Wegovy. In North America operations, obesity care sales grew 156%. Total rare disease sales decreased by 16%, driven by a 17% decrease in international operations and by a 14% decrease in North America operations, where endocrine disorder sales were unfortunately impacted by a temporary reduction in manufacturing output. Please turn to the next slide. With 21% sales growth in our diabetes care, we are growing faster than the total diabetes market, leading to an increased market share of 32.2%. With this, we are on track to reach one-third of the diabetes value market by 2025. This increase primarily reflects GLP-1 market growth as well as share gains in both operating units.",
			"Please turn to the next slide. In international operations, total diabetes care sales increased by 12% in the first 3 months of 2023, driven by GLP-1 sales growing 52%. Novo Nordisk is the market leader in international operations with a GLP-1 value market share of 65%, driven by all geographies. Ozempic continues its GLP-1 market leadership with around 44% market share. We are also pleased to see Rybelsus increasing its market share to just shy of 9%, driven by a strong uptake across geographies. And with that, I will hand over the word to Doug.",
			"<strong>Doug Langa:</strong> Thank you for that update, Camilla. Please turn to the next slide. At around 60% volume growth in Q1 of 2023, the U.S. GLP-1 market continued to accelerate. This acceleration is driven by all-time high levels of new patients starting on our portfolio of GLP-1 products. Measured on total prescriptions, Novo Nordisk has expanded its market leadership position with a current market share of around 53%. Please go to the next slide. Obesity care sales increased by 124%, with 156% growth in North America operations and 65% growth in international operations. The global brand of obesity market expansion continues with a global volume growth of 54%. In international operations, we are encouraged by the continued performance of Saxenda and that the Wegovy launches in Denmark and Norway are both progressing very well.",
			"In the U.S., obesity care sales grew by 162%, with both Wegovy and Saxenda contributing to the growth. Since the Wegovy commercial relaunch in January of 2023, the prescription trends have highlighted the high unmet need for safe and efficacious products to help people living with obesity. We continue to scale supply capacity. And the second CMO for Wegovy is now producing to the market, providing additional capacity and risk mitigation. However, to safeguard continuity of care, the supply of the lower Wegovy dose strengths in the U.S. will be reduced temporarily. Next slide, please. Our rare disease sales decreased by 16%, driven by a 17% sales decrease in international operations and by a 14% decrease in North America operations. Rare blood disorder sales decreased by 3%, driven by NovoSeven, and partially offset by the launch of products in hemophilia A and B.",
			"Specifically, hemophilia A sales grew by 19%, hemophilia B by 15%, and NovoSeven decreased by 11%. Rare endocrine disorder sales declined by 38%, reflecting a temporary reduction in manufacturing output and lower realized prices in the U.S. Now over to you, Martin, for an update on R&amp;D.",
			"<strong>Martin Lange:</strong> Thank you, Doug. Please turn to Slide 11. In March, we announced the exciting headline results from the PIONEER PLUS phase 3b trial with once-daily oral semaglutide 25 and 50 milligram, respectively. PIONEER PLUS was a blinded 68-week trial comparing once-daily oral semaglutide 25 and 50 milligram to that of 14 milligram. The objective of the trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of semaglutide, 25 and 50 milligram as an add-on to stable doses of one to three oral antidiabetic medicines in approximately 1,600 people with Type 2 diabetes in need of treatment intensification. The trial achieved its primary endpoint by demonstrating a superior reduction in A1c at week 52 with both doses as compared to 14 milligram.",
			"Here, we present the trial product estimands for A1c and weight loss. From a baseline of A1c of 9%, people treated with 25 and 50 milligram achieved statistically significant A1c reductions of 1.9 and 2.2 percentage points, respectively, compared with 1.5 percentage points with 14 milligram. People in the trial had a mean baseline body weight of 96.4 kilograms. People receiving 25 and 50 milligram of semaglutide experienced a statistically significantly higher weight loss of 7 and 9.2 kilograms, respectively, compared with a reduction of 4.5 kilograms with 14 milligram. In the trial, all doses of oral semaglutide appear to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal and were consistent with the GLP-1 receptor agonist class.",
			"GI events were most prominent during dose escalation and more frequent with oral semaglutide 25 and 50 milligram then with oral semaglutide 14 milligram. To sum up, we are very pleased with the results from the PIONEER PLUS trial that will provide people with Type 2 diabetes with further dose escalation options if additional glycemic control or weight loss is required. We expect to file for regulatory approval in the U.S. and EU during 2023. Given the impressive growth that we are seeing across semaglutide brands, the global rollout of the 25- and 50-milligram doses is contingent on portfolio prioritizations and manufacturing capacity. Next slide, please. Turning to broader R&amp;D milestones. I would like to highlight some of the other exciting events, trial readouts, and initiations across our therapy areas during the course of 2023.",
			"Within diabetes, I'm happy to share that we have submitted once-weekly insulin icodec for regulatory approval in the EU, U.S., and China for the treatment of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. We have also completed a Phase 2 trial with a fixed dose combination of subcutaneous semaglutide and a once-weekly GIP analog. The fixed-dose combination did not show superior A1C reductions or weight loss compared to semaglutide 2.4 milligram. Following the completion of the trial, we have terminated further development of this program. In relation to this, we have successfully completed a phase 1 trial with a GLP-1/GIP co-agonist. In the trial, the co-agonist appears safe and well tolerated. And based on the results, we now plan to initiate a Phase 2 trial with a subcutaneous formulation in pursuit of further innovation within the GLP-1 space.",
			"In April, we initiated the REDEFINE 3 trial, a cardiovascular outcome study with the objective to confirm cardiovascular safety of CagriSema compared to placebo in addition to standard of care. Furthermore, we plan to initiate REDEFINE 2 in Type 2 diabetes patients with obesity in the second half of 2023. Within obesity, we have many exciting phase 3 trials and readouts during 2023, including the cardiovascular outcomes trials: STEP, HFpEF, and SELECT with Wegovy. Both trials are designed to look beyond weight loss and focus on obesity-associated comorbidities. We believe that reducing the risk of obesity-associated comorbidities will not only make a big difference for the individual patients, but also add broader value to society. Later this quarter, we are also looking forward to the readout of the OASIS 1 trial with oral semaglutide, 50 milligram.",
			"This will be the first GLP-1 in a tablet for the treatment of obesity. With regard to concizumab for the treatment of hemophilia A and B with inhibitors, we received a complete response letter from the FDA. In the letter, the FDA requested additional information related to the monitoring and dosing of patients to ensure that concizumab is administered as intended. Further information on the manufacturing process was also requested. We will work now closely with the FDA to provide the requested data. And importantly, concizumab was earlier this quarter approved in Canada. In rare endocrine disorders, we are pleased that Sogroya, the long-acting growth hormone somapacitan, was approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of children with growth hormone deficiency, 2.5 years of age and older.",
			"Lastly, within other serious chronic diseases, we are excited to share that we have now initiated two cell-based therapy treatments in advanced heart failure and Parkinson's disease, respectively. This reflects our commitment to continuously mature our technology platforms that are essential to drive innovation across the diseases that we target. With that, over to you, Karsten.",
			"<strong>Karsten Munk Knudsen:</strong> Thank you, Martin. Please turn to the next slide. In the first three months of 2023, our sales grew by 27% in Danish kroner and 25% at constant exchange rates, driven by both our operating units. The gross margin increased to 84.7% compared to 83.5% in 2022. The increase is driven by a positive product mix, reflecting increased sales of GLP-1-based treatments and a positive currency impact. This is partially countered by costs related to the ongoing capacity expansions as well as lower realized prices, mainly in the U.S. and China. Sales and distribution costs increased by 22% in Danish kroner and by 20% at constant exchange rates. The increase is driven by both operating units. In North America operations, the cost increase is driven by the relaunch of Wegovy and promotional activities for Ozempic.",
			"In international operations, the cost increase is driven by promotional activities for Rybelsus and Ozempic, as well as obesity care market development activities. Research and development costs increased by 29% measured in Danish kroner and 28% at constant exchange rates. The increase is driven by higher late-stage clinical trial activity and increased early research activities compared to the first quarter of 2022. The acquisition of Forma Therapeutics in 2022 also impacted R&amp;D spend. Administration costs increased by 10% measured in Danish kroner and by 9% at constant exchange rates. Operating profit increased by 31% measured in Danish kroner and by 28% at constant exchange rates, reflecting the sales growth. Net financial items showed a net loss of DKK 0.3 billion compared to a net loss of around DKK 1.2 billion in 2022.",
			"This primarily reflects losses on nonhedged currencies. As per the end of March '23, a positive market value of financial contracts of approximately DKK 2.2 billion has been deferred for recognition in 2023. The effective tax rate in the first three months of 2023 was 19.9% compared to an effective tax rate of 20.7% in 2022. Net profit increased by 39%, and diluted earnings per share increased by 41% to DKK 8.78. Free cash flow was at DKK 24.8 billion compared to DKK 21.6 billion in 2022, supporting the strategic aspiration to deliver attractive capital allocation to shareholders. The cash conversion is positively impacted by timing of payment of rebates in the U.S. This includes provisions related to the revised 340B distribution policy in the U.S. Please note that income under the 340B program has been partially recognized.",
			"Capital expenditure for property, plant, and equipment was DKK 4.7 billion compared to DKK 1.5 billion in 2022. This reflects investments in additional capacity for active pharmaceutical ingredient production and fill/finish capacity for both current and future injectable and oral products. Please go to the next slide. We entered 2023 with a solid growth momentum. And following the acceleration seen in the first quarter, we expect sales growth to be between to 24% and 30% at constant exchange rates. This is based on a number of assumptions as described in the company announcement. The guidance reflects expectations for sales growth in both operating units and mainly driven by volume growth of GLP-1-based treatments for diabetes and obesity care.",
			"This is partially countered by declining sales in rare disease due to a temporary reduction in manufacturing output. The guidance ranges for sales and operating profit reflect the level of volume growth of GLP-1-based diabetes treatments. It also reflects the inherent uncertainty of the pace of obesity care market expansion, following the relaunch of Wegovy in the U.S. and gradual rollout in international operations. The outlook includes an expectation of continued periodic supply constraints and the related drug shortage notifications in 2023 across a number of products and geographies. This is driven by higher-than-expected volume growth for GLP-1-based products, such as Ozempic and Wegovy and temporary capacity limitations at some manufacturing sites.",
			"We are continuing to increase our supply capacity. We expect that operating profit will grow between 28% and 34% at constant exchange rates. This primarily reflects the sales growth outlook and continued investments in future and current growth drivers within research, development, and commercial. In R&amp;D, we continue to invest to progress the mid- and late-stage pipeline while expanding and progressing our preclinical project portfolio. The step-up in commercial investments are mainly allocated to the relaunch of Wegovy in the U.S., obesity care market development activities in international operations, as well as promotional activities for Ozempic and Rybelsus. For 2023, we expect net financial items to amount to a gain of around DKK 3 billion, mainly reflecting gains associated with foreign exchange hedging contracts.",
			"Capital expenditure is still expected to be around DKK 25 billion, reflecting investments in additional capacity for active pharmaceutical ingredients and fill/finish capacity for both current and future injectable and oral products. Our free cash flow is now expected to be between DKK 66 million and DKK 78 billion, reflecting the sales growth and investments in capital expenditures. Based on the increased expectations for cash flow generation, the board of directors has approved an expansion of the 2023 share repurchase program by DKK 2 billion to DKK 30 billion in total. That caused the outlook for 2023. Now back to you, Lars, for final remarks.",
			"<strong>Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen:</strong> Thank you, Karsten. Please turn to the final slide. We're very pleased with the double-digit sales growth for the first three months of 2023. Sales growth was driven by both international operations as well as North America operations. While both operating units contributed to sales growth, the Wegovy relaunch has accelerated sales growth in North America. In general, the sales growth was driven by a continued strong demand for our portfolio of GLP-1 treatment for diabetes and obesity care. The commercial relaunch of Wegovy in the U.S. has underlined the high unmet need for efficacious and safe treatments for people living with obesity and value to society. We're very pleased with the readout of the PIONEER PLUS trial, which has established a new efficacy standard for all diabetes treatments.",
			"These results have made us optimistic ahead of the OASIS 1 results, covering oral semaglutide in obesity. Overall, we look forward to sharing results from several exciting trials reading out in 2023. With that, we're now ready for the Q&amp;A, while I kindly ask all participants to limit her or himself to one or maximum two questions. Operator, we're now ready to take the first question.",

			"Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) has had a rough three months with its share price down 7.2%. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Thermo Fisher Scientific's;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nyse-tmo/thermo-fisher-scientific?blueprint=2495463&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=intro&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Thermo Fisher Scientific's </a> ROE today.",
			"Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.",
			"<span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:View our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nyse-tmo/thermo-fisher-scientific?blueprint=2495463&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific </a></span>",
			"The <strong>formula for return on equity</strong> is:",
			"Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity",
			"So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Thermo Fisher Scientific is:",
			"14% = US$6.0b ÷ US$42b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).",
			"The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.14 in profit.",
			"Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.",
			"To begin with, Thermo Fisher Scientific seems to have a respectable ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 14% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This certainly adds some context to Thermo Fisher Scientific's exceptional 24% net income growth seen over the past five years. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.",
			"We then performed a comparison between Thermo Fisher Scientific's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 29% in the same period.",
			"The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:check if Thermo Fisher Scientific is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nyse-tmo/thermo-fisher-scientific/valuation?blueprint=2495463&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=conclusion&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">check if Thermo Fisher Scientific is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E</a>, relative to its industry.",
			"Thermo Fisher Scientific has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 5.8%, meaning that it has the remaining 94% left over to reinvest into its business. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.",
			"Moreover, Thermo Fisher Scientific is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 4.9%. However, Thermo Fisher Scientific's ROE is predicted to rise to 22% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.",
			"On the whole, we feel that Thermo Fisher Scientific's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

			"After macroeconomic headwinds impacted the top and bottom lines of Zacks Medical – Products industry participants in 2022, there seems to have been a recovery in the first quarter of 2023. The supply-chain challenges that adversely impacted shipments in 2022 started to dissipate in the last quarter of 2022 and the improvement continues in 2023. As the supply chain eases going forward, top-line growth will continue to improve. The European and international markets are also showing signs of a steady recovery in demand for medical products. Meanwhile, the rising cost of materials and labor shortages that resulted in inflationary pressure in 2022 are likely to continue. However, the impact is likely to be less severe than last year due to a favorable base effect. A gradual increase in pricing of products and services will also help to offset higher costs and expenses.",
			"Several industry players have the potential to ride on the recovery trend within the industry, creating wealth for investors. Industry participants like <strong>Stryker</strong> SYK, <strong>Boston Scientific</strong> BSX, <strong>Zimmer Biomet</strong> ZBH and <strong>Insulet</strong> PODD are likely to gain from the rebound in demand and new cost-cutting initiatives.",

			"The industry includes companies providing medical products and cutting-edge technologies for diagnosis, observation, consultation, treatment and other healthcare services. The industry players are primarily focused on research and development. The industry participants primarily cater to vital therapeutic areas like cardiovascular, nephrology and urology devices, to name a few. Strengthening dollar and labor shortage are hurting top-line growth. Ongoing disruption due to volume-based procurement policy in China is hurting sales. Recent inflationary pressure and labor shortages are weighing on gross and operating margins of the industry players. The trend is likely to continue in 2023. However, rising demand for medical procedures along with cost-cutting initiatives is likely to drive industry performance going forward.",

			"<strong>AI, Medical Mechatronics &amp; Robotics:</strong> The rising utilization of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, use of IT for quick and improved patient care and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model underscore the growing influence of AI in the Medical Products space. In fact, mechatronics — a high-end technology incorporating electronics, machine learning and mechanical engineering — is rapidly becoming a defining characteristic of the space. There are several companies that have shown substantial prowess when it comes to their involvement in AI, robotics and medical mechatronics. Advancements in robot-assisted surgical platforms continue to be crucial with respect to minimally-invasive surgery that helps in reducing trauma associated with open surgery. With respect to Mechatronics, the benefits of the same have been demonstrated in the form of 3D printing, which has altered the face of the medical devices industry. Currently, 3D printing is being utilized to print stem cells, blood vessels, heart tissues, prosthetic organs and skin.",
			"<strong>Rising Demand for IVD:</strong> Toward the end of February 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak started to spread rapidly and took the shape of a pandemic. This led to a rise in global demand for diagnostic testing kits in order to curb the spread of the virus. Testing became the need of the hour and that led to a shift in the pipeline of IVD products, with a large number of rapid, point-of-care devices going into development. Companies not only received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA but also bolstered production to aid testing shortages. Industry players anticipate significant demand for rapid diagnostic testing in the future as well and are well-poised to capitalize on the same.",

Insulet earns a huge share of revenues from the Omnipod System in the United States, Canada, Europe and Israel.

			"The FDA granted a priority review to a supplemental new drug application (sNDA), seeking expanded use of Linzess in children and adolescents with functional constipation. A final decision on the sNDA is expected on Jun 14, 2023. Currently, there is no FDA-approved therapy for children with functional constipation.",

The clinical study for the same is being conducted by COUR Pharmaceuticals to evaluate its safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic effects and efficacy in PBC patients.

That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$754, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 26% of Arthur Ryan's stake.

			"<b>Johnson &amp; Johnson</b> (JNJ) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.",
			"Shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned -1.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.9% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Johnson &amp; Johnson belongs, has gained 4.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?",
			"While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.",
			"<b>Revisions to Earnings Estimates</b>",
			"Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.",
			"Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.",
			"For the current quarter, Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.62 per share, indicating a change of +1.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.",
			"For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.66 points to a change of +5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.5%.",
			"For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.01 indicates a change of +3.2% from what Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.7%.",
			"Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Johnson &amp; Johnson is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).",
			"The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:",
			"<b>12 Month EPS</b>",
			"<b>Revenue Growth Forecast</b>",
			"While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.",
			"For Johnson &amp; Johnson, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $24.64 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $98.83 billion and $101.04 billion estimates indicate +4.1% and +2.2% changes, respectively.",
			"<b>Last Reported Results and Surprise History</b>",
			"Johnson &amp; Johnson reported revenues of $24.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.6%. EPS of $2.68 for the same period compares with $2.67 a year ago.",
			"Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.57 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.01%. The EPS surprise was +6.77%.",
			"The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.",
			"<b>Valuation</b>",
			"No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.",
			"While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.",
			"The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.",
			"Johnson &amp; Johnson is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.",
			"<b>Conclusion</b>",
			"The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Johnson &amp; Johnson. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.",

These stocks have returned 40.6%, 23.3%, and 36.94%, respectively, over the past year. This stock performance on the part of these companies can thus be a reliable indicator of the prospective future success of these stocks, making them worth the risk for many investors. Additionally, those who are entering the financial markets with prior knowledge of how to navigate them are more likely to take on such risks.

			"For those who have been trained on how to approach the markets in this manner, risky investment strategies like picking cheap stocks with high momentum can be an exciting endeavor. For example, investing in a penny stock under $5, which has posted returns of 30% or more over the past year, can be an adventurous way for an investor to cash in on large profits. Such cheap stocks with high momentum and positive price returns are often the best options for a stock market game since they add an element of adventure and uncertainty to the trade, and it can often be a challenge to make the right bet on the right stock. Thus, while penny stocks have always been risky investments, they can be incredibly attractive for those who can stomach the risk and stick with a stock they truly believe has the potential to rise to great heights.

			"The broader market is grappling with renewed worries about potential bank failures. This is creating uncertainties and will continue to make the market volatile. Hence, creating a portfolio of low-beta stocks is of utmost importance since the securities will deliver healthy returns and shield against choppy market conditions.",
			"In this regard, stocks like <strong>Penumbra Inc</strong> PEN, <strong>Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.</strong> LW, <strong>Transportadora de Gas del Sur SA</strong> TGS and <strong>Novo Nordisk A/S </strong>NVO are worth betting on.",
			"Beta measures the volatility or risk of a particular asset compared to the market. In other words, beta measures the extent of a security’s price movement relative to the market. In this article, we are considering the S&amp;P 500 as the market.",
			"If a stock has a beta of 1, then the price of the stock will move with the market. So, the stock is more volatile than the market if its beta is more than 1. In the same way, the stock is not as volatile as the market if its beta is less than 1.",
			"For example, if the market offers a return of 20%, a stock with a beta of 3 will return 60%, which is overwhelming. Similarly, when the market slips 20%, the stock will sink 60%, which is devastating.",
			"We have taken <strong>beta between 0 and 0.6</strong> as our prime criterion for screening stocks that are less volatile than the market. However, this should not be the only factor to be considered while selecting a winning strategy. We need to take into account other parameters as well that can add value to the portfolio.",

			"<strong>Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. </strong>BIO posted first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.34, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.1%. However, the bottom line declined 33.5% from the prior-year quarter.",
			"The quarter’s adjustments eliminate the impacts of certain non-recurring items like the amortization of purchased intangibles, gains/losses from the change in the fair market value of equity securities and loan receivable, restructuring costs and others.",
			"The GAAP EPS of the company was $2.32 per share in the first quarter against a GAAP loss of $112.5 in the year-ago quarter.",
			"Revenues of $676.8 million in the quarter beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.4%. However, revenues declined 3.3% from the year-ago quarter (down 0.3% at the constant exchange rate or CER). The company reported COVID-19-related revenues of $2.6 million, a significant decline from the $45 million reported a year ago.",
			"Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. Quote",
			"Sales in the Life Science segment in the first quarter totaled $323.6 million, down 6.8% year over year and 3.6% at CER. The sales decline was primarily due to lower COVID-19-related sales. Excluding pandemic-related sales, Life Science revenues increased 9.6%, primarily driven by Droplet Digital PCR, Western blotting, and qPCR products.",
			"Net sales in the Clinical Diagnostics segment totaled $352.1 million, flat on a year-over-year basis and up 2.8% at CER. Apart from COVID-19-related sales, revenues increased 3.1% year over year, led by the robust demand for diagnostic instruments primarily within blood typing and diabetes.",
			"In the quarter under review, Bio-Rad’s gross profit fell 10% to $362.4 million. The gross margin contracted 397 basis points (bps) to 53.6%. This can be attributed to lower pandemic-related sales, an unfavorable product mix and a higher cost of raw materials.",
			"Operating expenses were $300.5 million in the first quarter, up 17.3% year over year. The operating profit totaled $62 million, reflecting a 57.7% decrease from the prior-year quarter. The operating margin in the first quarter contracted 1177 bps to 9.1%.",
			"Bio-Rad exited the first quarter of 2023 with cash and cash equivalents (including short-term investments) of 1.85 billion compared with $1.80 billion at the end of 2022. Total debt (including current maturities) at the end of the first quarter was $1.20 billion, near the reported figure at the end of 2022.",
			"The cumulative net cash flow from operating activities at the end of the first quarter of 2023 was $98.1 million compared with the year-ago figure of $50.5 million.",
			"Bio-Rad updated its guidance for the full-year 2023.",
			"The company anticipates currency-neutral revenue growth of approximately 4.5% (previously 6%-7%). Excluding pandemic-related sales, the company estimates currency-neutral 2023 revenue growth of 8.5% (earlier 10%-11%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.95 billion.",
			"The adjusted operating margin projection for the full year is 17.5% (earlier 19.5%).",
			"Bio-Rad exited the first quarter of 2023 with an earnings beat, while revenues almost matched estimates. The demand for BIO’s newly launched ddPCR platform and QX600 continued to be strong in the first quarter. From its growing pipeline, Bio-Rad is set to introduce the ddPCR microsatellite instability kit towards the end of the quarter, expanding the company’s oncology assay menu for Droplet Digital PCR.",
			"A significant decline in COVID-19-related sales impacted the year-over-year decrease in the quarter’s top line. Further, increased sanctions in Russia and headwinds related to early-stage biotech companies negatively affected BIO’s performance in the first quarter.",
			"On the supply-chain front, Bio-Rad achieved a modest reduction of backlogs in the first quarter, short of its targeted reduction of approximately $30 million from the elevated 2022 backorders. BIO expects to clear the extended Life Science backlog by the end of the second quarter and the clinical backlog by the end of the year.",
			"Meanwhile, a contraction in the adjusted operating margin also raises apprehension. BIO’s gross margin for the quarter was additionally impacted by the higher-than-anticipated percentage of instrument sales versus reagents and lower-than-forecasted revenues in the Life Science Group.",
			"Bio-Rad currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)",

			"This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.44%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this health insurer would post earnings of $4.84 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.96, delivering a surprise of 2.48%.",
			"Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.",
			"Cigna , which belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, posted revenues of $46.48 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.11%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $44.11 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.",
			"The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.",
			"Cigna shares have lost about 26.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 5.8%.",
			"<b>What's Next for Cigna?</b>",
			"While Cigna has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?",
			"There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.",
			"Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.",
			"Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Cigna: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.",
			"It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $6.41 on $47.07 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $24.78 on $187.89 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.",
			"Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Insurance - Multi line is currently in the top 43% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.",

			"For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.",
			"In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like <strong>Bristol-Myers Squibb</strong> (<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:NYSE:BMY;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/pharmaceuticals-biotech/nyse-bmy/bristol-myers-squibb?blueprint=2495007&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=intro&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NYSE:BMY</a>), which has not only revenues, but also profits.

			"Over the last three years, Bristol-Myers Squibb has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. Bristol-Myers Squibb's EPS has risen over the last 12 months, growing from US$2.84 to US$3.48. This amounts to a 22% gain; a figure that shareholders will be pleased to see.",
			"One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Bristol-Myers Squibb's EBIT margins are flat but, worryingly, its revenue is actually down. Suffice it to say that is not a great sign of growth.",

Holding US$93m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.",
			"One important encouraging feature of Bristol-Myers Squibb is that it is growing profits. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. That combination is very appealing.

			"Even a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. The last payment was quite easily covered by earnings, but it made up 113% of cash flows. This signals that the company is more focused on returning cash flow to shareholders, but it could mean that the dividend is exposed to cuts in the future.",
			"Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 144.8% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 32% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.",
			"The company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.96, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $4.52. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 8.7% over that duration. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.",
			"Investors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Eli Lilly has impressed us by growing EPS at 42% per year over the past five years. The company's earnings per share has grown rapidly in recent years, and it has a good balance between reinvesting and paying dividends to shareholders, so we think that Eli Lilly could prove to be a strong dividend payer.",
			"In summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think Eli Lilly's payments are rock solid. With cash flows lacking, it is difficult to see how the company can sustain a dividend payment. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.",

(Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference is being recorded. <br/>I will now turn the call over to Ryan Crowe, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.",
			"<strong>Ryan Crowe</strong>",
			"Thank you, Josh. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening to everyone listening around the world. Thank you for your interest in Regeneron and welcome to our first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our Investor Relations website shortly after the call ends. <br/>Joining me today are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. George Yancopoulos, Co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer; Marion McCourt, Executive Vice President and Head of Commercial; and Bob Landry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&amp;A. <br/>I would like to remind you that remarks made on today's call may include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, those related to Regeneron and its products and business, financial forecast and guidance, revenue diversification, development programs and related anticipated milestones, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, payer coverage and reimbursement issues, intellectual property, pending litigation and other proceedings and competition. <br/>Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected in that statement. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC this morning. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. <br/>In addition, please note that GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed in today's call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP is available in our financial results press release and our corporate presentation, which can be accessed on our website. Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions. <br/>With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer. Len?",
			"<strong>Leonard S. Schleifer</strong>",
			"Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone joining today's call. Following our significant achievements in 2022, Regeneron is off to a good start in 2023, highlighted by important regulatory and pipeline advances, commercial execution and prudent capital allocation, all of which position better the company to deliver sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value over time. <br/>George, Marion and Bob will cover details of our first quarter performance in a few moments. In the meantime, I would provide an update on our goal of continuing to grow our business while simultaneously diversifying our revenue and earnings streams, which is part of our long-term vision for Regeneron. <br/>We have made substantial progress toward achieving that goal. Over the past 4 years, while total revenues have nearly doubled, EYLEA accounted for only 57% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 88% of total revenues for the year 2019. Driven primarily by the growth of Dupixent, our Sanofi collaboration accounted for 25% of our total revenues in the first quarter of 2023 compared to only 6% of our total revenues in 2019. We expect this trend of revenue growth, along with diversification to continue. <br/>For example, assuming the approval and successful launch of aflibercept 8 milligrams, which has a June 27 PDUFA date, EYLEA 2 milligrams is expected to become a smaller share of our revenues, while aflibercept 8 milligrams is expected to contribute to overall revenue growth. In addition, Dupixent remains in a high-growth mode, with global net product sales up 40% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year quarter, driven by growth across all 5 approved indications. <br/>We believe the positive Phase III results for Dupixent in the subpopulation of COPD patients with evidence of type 2 inflammation, as well as the promising results for our IL-33 antibody itepekimab in former smokers represent additional significant opportunities to accelerate revenue growth as well as diversification. <br/>Our oncology portfolio is also starting to make a meaningful contribution to our top line, with last year's acquisition of full global rights to Libtayo and the recent launch of Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Moreover, we believe that fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody, in combination with Libtayo, has the potential to become an important therapy in both melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, where we have already advanced to pivotal studies. <br/>We are also quite excited about the emerging clinical profile for linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific. Updated data for which will be presented at the upcoming ASCO Annual Meeting. We remain on track to submit a BLA seeking accelerated approval in late-stage myeloma later this year. <br/>We continue to invest in our research and development engine and expect it will deliver new differentiated medicines that will drive organic growth over time. Our broad development pipeline of nearly 3 dozen programs spans many different therapeutic areas and modalities, notably: Our co-stimulatory bispecifics in cancer; our early pipeline in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; as well as our collaborations with Alnylam, Intellia, Decibel and others are expected to drive medium- and long-term revenue growth, profitability and diversification. <br/>Before handing over to George, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the contributions that Dr. Roy Vagelos has made to Regeneron over the nearly 3 decades that he has served as our Board Chair. Over the years, he has provided invaluable guidance and he continues to inspire us as we work to turn world-class science into medicines. Roy will retire from the Board after his current term ends next month. At that time, in addition to our current roles in the company, George and I will be appointed by the Board to serve as co-Chairs, and Christine Poon, a member of Regeneron's Board since 2010, will be appointed as the Board's Lead Independent Director. <br/>With that, let me turn the call over to George.",

			"Thank you, Len. The first quarter of 2023 delivered multiple significant milestones for Regeneron and for our collaborations, from the positive Dupixent Phase III COPD data to progress in our oncology pipeline, as well as exciting new landmarks from our genetic medicines programs. <br/>Starting with Dupixent. In March, together with our Sanofi collaborators, we announced that Dupixent was the first immune mechanism of action treatment to produce statistically significant and clinically meaningful results in a Phase III trial for COPD in over a decade. Our BOREAS trial enrolled COPD patients with moderate to severe disease and evidence of type 2 inflammation. <br/>Dupixent-treated patients demonstrated a clinically meaningful 30% reduction in exacerbations, a significant improvement in lung function as well as quality of life benefits: An impressive trifecta in a potential paradigm-changing treatment for this deadly disease. We are looking forward to presenting the detailed BOREAS results in a late-breaking presentation at the upcoming American Thoracic Society Meeting later this month. We also plan to discuss these exciting results with regulatory authorities and expect to report results mid next year for the replicate Phase III NOTUS study. <br/>I would remind you that we are also trying to address an overlapping COPD population with our IL-33 antibody, which is in Phase III studies based on positive Phase II proof-of-concept data. This approach is further supported by genetic analysis from our Regeneron Genetics Center, which demonstrated association of loss of function in interleukin-33 with reduced COPD risk. Similar genetic analysis supported the role for a Dupixent benefit in COPD. <br/>The BOREAS COPD data indicates that Dupixent can help even more patients beyond the 5 current FDA-approved indications and diseases caused or exacerbated by type 2 inflammation, including atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis. We are also expecting an FDA decision for Dupixent for chronic spontaneous urticaria on October 22, 2023, and we are continuing to tailor Dupixent development to patients with other type 2 inflammatory diseases, most likely to be responsive to this method. <br/>Moving to oncology. With the progress of our late and early stage pipeline, we are looking forward to several important milestones this year. Starting with Libtayo. In addition to expanded use in lung cancer, Libtayo was recently added to the NCCN guidelines for neoadjuvant treatment of CSCC. The Libtayo U.S. label was also recently updated with more mature CSCC and BCC data, supporting its differentiated clinical profile in these tumor settings and satisfying all post-marketing commitments that require full approval in these indications. <br/>Regarding our exciting new combinations with Libtayo. Starting with fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibodies, for which we are planning a broad pivotal program spanning several cancer indications. These efforts were triggered by our robust and confirmed data in first-line metastatic melanoma patients, which will be presented in further detail at ASCO, suggesting that the fianlimab-Libtayo combination could produce about double the response rates with longer progression-free survival, the anti-PD monotherapy standard. Based on this, we have already initiated pivotal trials in metastatic and adjuvant melanoma, and we will start a study in perioperative melanoma in the second half of the year. In addition, based on promising data in small patient cohorts, we started a seamless Phase II/III pivotal study for treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, and we will soon start a Phase II study in the perioperative setting. <br/>Next, the bispecifics for solid tumors, which are being investigated in combination with Libtayo. Earlier this year, ASCO's GU represented initial positive first-in-human data for our PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with Libtayo in advanced prostate cancer, the tumor type considered immunologically cold and largely unresponsive to anti-PD-1 therapy alone. Over the next 12 months we plan to present updated PSMAxCD28 data in more patients, some of which will have been prophylactically treated with our anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, sarilumab, to potentially reduce the severity of immune-mediated side effects while maintaining or improving antitumor activity. Also during this time frame, we plan to present data in advanced ovarian cancer for both our MUC16xCD3 bispecific in our MUC16xCD28 costimulatory bispecific as well as data in several tumor types from our EGFRxCD28 costimulatory bispecific, or in combination with Libtayo. <br/>Our hematology oncology pipeline continues to advance. In an oral presentation at the upcoming ASCO Annual Meeting, we will present updated data for linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific tested in late-line multiple myeloma. We believe these data will show that linvoseltamab has the best-in-class potential with differentiated efficacy, safety and a favorable dosing schedule in the competitive environment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma treatment candidates. We remain on track for a regulatory submission in the United States in the second half of this year for linvoseltamab. <br/>For odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific, we are on track to complete U.S. and EU regulatory submissions for both relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in the second half of this year. Odronextamab in late-line relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma has a potential best-in-class efficacy profile, and our optimized step-up dosing regimen has improved our generic safety profile without impacting efficacy. Also, we have initiated a first-in-human study of our CD22xCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with odronextamab in relapsed/refractory DLBCL, which we hope could further improve upon the anticancer benefit for these patients. <br/>Now to genetics medicines. Starting with our collaboration with Alnylam, and siRNA therapeutics. Just last week, we and Alnylam announced an important update for our Alnylam APP program in early onset Alzheimer's disease. For the first time, an RNAi therapeutic demonstrates sustained silencing of a pathological gene in the central nerve system in a clinical trial. In the earnings call this morning, our Alnylam collaborators provided additional details on these results. Our siRNA approach aims to prevent production of amyloid precursor protein as opposed to clearing existing amyloid plaques after they have already formed, providing a new way to potentially address Alzheimer's disease, which will still have a devastating impact on patients and their families even with the emergence of amyloid-clearing antibodies. <br/>Patients treated with single doses of ALN-APP experienced dose-dependent, rapid and sustained reduction of up to 90% in APP production as assessed by biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid. The safety and tolerability profile with single dosing is encouraging so far. While the multi-dose Part B portion of the study is on partial clinical hold in the United States due to finding reserved in prior nonclinical chronic toxicology studies, Part B has already received regulatory approval to proceed in Canada, where the majority of the part A clinical trial patients had been enrolled. <br/>Detailed results from the study will be presented in an upcoming medical meeting. We are looking forward to advancing additional development candidates for the many other neurodegenerative diseases that currently have few or no therapeutic options such as other targets for Alzheimer's as well as for ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, Parkinson's and Huntington's. <br/>In addition to these exciting developments in central nervous system diseases, we are continuing our progress with liver targeted medicines, including our broad and multipronged approach to develop treatments for NASH, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. We're enrolling a Phase II study of ALN-HSD in NASH patients with genetic risk factors, continuing clinical development of ALN-PNP, and we are planning to progress additional more recently genetically validated NASH targets as well. <br/>Finally, I would like to highlight our recently announced collaboration with Sonoma Biotherapeutics' discover, develop and commercialize regulatory T cell therapies for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. This collaboration will bring together our industry-leading technologies for the discovery and characterization of fully human antibodies and T cell receptors, as well as our additional biologics candidates with Sonoma's pioneering approach to developing and manufacturing gene modified T reg cell therapies. <br/>In conclusion, Regeneron's R&amp;D engine truly continues its productivity in both late and early-stage pipeline. Before turning the call over to Marion, I would also like to thank Roy Vagelos for serving as a role model for all of us at Regeneron as well as for so many others across the industry. I hope that we can continue to live up to the high standards that Roy has set over his distinguished career. <br/>With that, I will turn the call over to Marion.",

			"Thank you, George. Our first quarter performance demonstrates ongoing leadership across multiple therapeutic categories. Taken together, our in-market brands anticipated near-term launches and extensive development pipeline uniquely position Regeneron to expand our leadership across multiple disease areas. <br/>First quarter EYLEA U.S. net product sales declined 6% year-over-year to $1.43 billion. On a sequential quarter basis, EYLEA U.S. net product sales decreased 4%, reflecting the favorable impact of higher demand volume, offset by lower sequential wholesaler inventory levels, higher sales-related deductions and increasing competitive pressure. EYLEA captured approximately 70% branded share in the first quarter. <br/>Based on presentations at scientific meetings, the retina community has expressed increasing enthusiasm about Regeneron's portfolio with the aflibercept 8-milligram PDUFA date, now 7 weeks away. EYLEA is the well-established gold standard anti-VEGF treatment and aflibercept 8-milligram has the potential to be as paradigm changing as EYLEA when it was introduced more than a decade ago. <br/>In clinical trials of aflibercept 8-milligram demonstrated improvements in visual acuity with less frequent injections and a safety profile comparable to EYLEA, exactly what retina specialists have told us they need in a next-generation medicine. Launch preparations are well underway, and we look forward to bringing this important treatment option to patients following FDA approval. <br/>On to Libtayo, which is foundational to Regeneron's oncology portfolio, first quarter global net product sales grew 49% on a constant currency basis, reaching $183 million, which includes $6 million from Sanofi transition sales in international markets. In the U.S., net sales grew 39% to $110 million. Libtayo continues to lead the market in both advanced CSCC and advanced BCC as demand volume increases. <br/>Following last November's FDA approval of Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy for first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer, new patient starts have accelerated as physicians of Libtayo has an important new treatment option, initiatives to raise brand awareness and improve access have driven share gains in both the academic and community settings. Outside the U.S., Libtayo net sales grew 67% on a constant currency basis to $73 million, driven by steadily increasing demand and additional country launches. The European Commission recently approved Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy for PD-L1 positive lung cancer, and we are in the process of securing access and reimbursement for this new indication. <br/>Turning to Dupixent. First quarter global net sales grew 40% on a constant currency basis to $2.49 billion. In the U.S., net sales grew 43% to $1.9 billion, with notable volume growth across all approved indications. Driven by its outstanding efficacy and safety profile, Dupixent is the #1 prescribed biologic for new patients in all 5 of its approved indications. <br/>In atopic dermatitis, Dupixent is the leading systemic treatment based on its unique mechanism of action, clinical profile and real world experience. Strong prescribing trends continue across moderate and severe disease and across approved age ranges. There's also significant opportunity to further increase market penetration as Dupixent is uniquely positioned to provide an effective, safe and convenient treatment for patients 6 months and older. <br/>In prurigo nodularis, Dupixent is the only FDA-approved systemic treatment. Launch update is progressing well, and we anticipate ongoing growth as we leverage our dermatology commercialization capabilities for patients in need. Across the competitive asthma space, Dupixent continues to gain market share as naive and biologic switch patients are initiated on treatment. Dupixent also continues to capture the majority of market demand in nasal polyps with increased prescribing from allergists and ENTs. <br/>Our cytosolic esophagitis launch is exceeding expectations. In the first year following U.S. approval, more than 11,000 patients have initiated therapy, demonstrating extensive unmet patient need and our strong launch execution and collaboration with Sanofi. Both gastroenterologists and analogists have embraced Dupixent as the new standard of care setting meaningful improvements in disease symptoms and quality of life for those now on therapy. A new patient campaign is underway to raise awareness of the scientific advancements in treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis. <br/>Outside the U.S., Dupixent net sales were $587 million, growing 30% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across approved indications and launches in new geographies. Recent European approvals of eosinophilic esophagitis, prurigo nodularis and atopic dermatitis in young children are expected to contribute to Dupixent's ongoing growth. <br/>In summary, our commercial portfolio continues to diversify across many serious medical conditions and delivered solid results in the quarter. Moving forward, we are well positioned to serve even more patients driven by the strength of our existing portfolio, coupled with anticipated launches that have the potential to advance standards of care. <br/>With that, I'll turn the call to Bob.",

			"Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron performed well in the first quarter of 2023 with solid financial results. First quarter total revenues increased 7% year-over-year to $3.2 billion as Dupixent and Libtayo contribute to increasingly diversified revenue and earning streams. First quarter diluted net income per share was $10.09 on net income of $1.2 billion, which included a previously announced $0.42 impact of acquired IPR&amp;D. <br/>Beginning with collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. First quarter 2023 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $847 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis versus first quarter 2022. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $357 million, of which $332 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $798 million in the first quarter and grew 26% versus last year's first quarter, which included a $50 million sales milestone that did not recur this year. <br/>Our share of profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and Kevzara was $637 million, an increase of 53% versus the prior year. We continue to see increasing profitability from our antibody collaboration and expect further margin expansion as we begin to realize drug substance yield improvements from a new Regeneron developed manufacturing process for Dupixent. Finally, we recorded Roche collaboration revenue of $222 million in the first quarter for our share of gross profits from ex U.S. sales of Ronapreve related to a previously signed contract. We do not expect to record any additional revenue from Ronapreve in 2023, absent a new contract. <br/>Moving now to operating expenses. First quarter 2023 R&amp;D expense increased 28% year-over-year to $960 million as we continue to invest in our pipeline to drive organic growth. The increase in R&amp;D was primarily driven by higher headcount and related costs and funding of the company's growing pipeline, which now encompasses approximately 35 programs in clinical development in more than 15 ongoing late-stage studies with additional study starts expected this year. These late-stage programs include our expanding fianlimab development program, upcoming Phase III studies and early reliance for our hem onc assets, as well as ongoing development programs for Dupixent and itepekimab for which we now record our full 50% share of development costs as a result of the Libtayo transaction. <br/>SG&amp;A expense increased 32% year-over-year to $515 million due to higher contributions to an independent, not-for-profit patient assistance organization, higher headcount and related costs, and the impact of the Libtayo transaction. First quarter 2023 COCM was $249 million, up 26% versus last year, due to increases in shipments of ex-U.S. commercial supplies of Praluent to Sanofi and manufacturing costs for Dupixent. Reimbursements for these production costs are recorded as part of other revenue in Sanofi collaboration revenue respectively. <br/>Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the first quarter of 2023, Regeneron generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities, less debt, of $12.3 billion. We have continued to strategically deploy our cash to deliver on our capital allocation priorities, which are focused on investing in innovation, both internal and external, as well as returning capital to shareholders. <br/>We purchased nearly $700 million of our shares in the first quarter with $3.1 billion remaining under our existing authorization as of March 31. Additionally, as George discussed, we announced the collaboration with Sonoma Biotherapeutics, investing $75 million through an upfront payment and equity investment to add a new approach to our scientific capabilities. <br/>I'd like to conclude with some select updates to our financial guidance and outlook for 2023. We are updating 2023 COCM guidance to be in the range of $820 million to $880 million, an increase of $90 million at the midpoint, reflecting increased shipments of ex-U.S. commercial supplies for Praluent and Dupixent to Sanofi. Importantly, these anticipated incremental expenses will be reimbursed by Sanofi, generally resulting in a neutral impact to Regeneron's 2023 operating profit. Approximately half of the incremental $90 million of reimbursements from Sanofi are expected to be recorded as Sanofi collaboration revenue, with the balance recorded as other revenue. <br/>As a result, we now expect 2023 other revenue to be higher than 2022 other revenue. For modeling purposes, second quarter 2023 other revenue is expected to be the lowest of the 2023 quarters, with the vast majority of the remaining other revenue to be recorded in the second half of this year. We are also updating our 2023 gross margin to be between 89% to 91%. The change in expected gross margin is primarily driven by an unfavorable change in product mix, as well as an increase in the start-up costs associated with our new fill/finish facility located in Upstate New York. <br/>Finally, we are lowering our guidance for our effective tax rate to 10% to 12%, reflecting the benefit of higher than previously anticipated stock-based compensation deductions. In conclusion, Regeneron continued to deliver robust financial results in the first quarter of 2023, and the company remains well positioned to drive further growth in the remainder of the year and beyond. <br/>With that, I will now pass the call back to Ryan.",

			"Thank you, Bob. Josh, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&amp;A. To ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. Please go ahead, Josh.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.",
			"<strong>Mohit Bansal</strong>",
			"Great. Maybe, Marion, if you could elaborate a little bit on the EYLEA, or Vabysmo dynamic at this point a little bit. Given the weakness in the quarter, you did mention that Vabysmo is taking some share. So if you could elaborate on where the share is coming from? Is it more of a switch? Or do you think it is also some new patient starts? And your confidence level in terms of flipping this situation once high-dose EYLEA comes along.",
			"<strong>Marion E. McCourt</strong>",
			"Sure, very happy to comment. And as I noted, as we're reporting on the quarter performance on a sequential basis, we did see with EYLEA, if I look at a sequential quarterly basis, we did see with EYLEA a net product sales decrease of 4%. As I mentioned, it was driven by a number of factors. Certainly, competitive pressure is one, but we also reflected on while we had slightly higher demand volume. It was offset by lower sequential wholesaler inventory levels and overall higher sales-related deductions.<br/>Specifically as it relates to competitive pressure, I would say that this is overall competitive dynamic in the anti-VEGF category, not something that we would necessarily identify with a particular product, more the totality of competition. I will comment that in the quarter, we certainly maintained a 70% branded share and over at approximately, I believe it was a 46% share in the overall anti-VEGF category. So certainly standard of care with EYLEA. And very importantly, we look forward to launching aflibercept 8 milligram, as I mentioned now, is about 7 weeks away.",

			"Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist.",
			"<strong>Robyn Kay Shelton Karnauskas</strong>",
			"Just some questions on LAG-3, and thinking about the first-line melanoma market and you're going to be having data relatively soon. So what -- I guess it's a multipart question. What is the bar for success, do you think, for the combination to be competitive? And when you think about penetrating into the nivo and checkpoint monotherapy buckets for first-line melanoma, can you help us understand how big these buckets are to actually model this opportunity better?",
			"<strong>George D. Yancopoulos</strong>",
			"Well, as we've already reported, based on our 2 confirmatory cohorts, we are seeing remarkable overall response rate increases over the PD-1 standard alone, almost doubling with much longer PFS. If we get anywhere near these numbers along with a satisfactory safety profile, which we had seen a favorable safety profile in the small studies, but if we reproduce or come anywhere close to reproducing these results, we believe that this will establish an entirely new standard of care for this disease. <br/>And as we all know, the first-line melanoma opportunity is very large, but we're also moving laterally and earlier and so forth into many additional applications within the melanoma opportunity itself. We're going -- we're already now in adjuvant and entering neoadjuvant studies. We'll also be going to other cancer settings, including lung cancer and so forth. So we consider this a major opportunity, and we can only help to -- if we approach the data that we've already seen in our earlier studies, it really has a chance to make a huge difference for these patients.",

			"<strong>Tyler Martin Van Buren</strong>",
			"For high-dose EYLEA, is there anything left to do on the regulatory front? And have you guys started labeling discussions yet? And forgive me for the follow-up, but just briefly for housekeeping and related to your response to the first question in prepared remarks, Marion, can you quantify the impact of the lower EYLEA inventory for the quarter?",
			"<strong>Leonard S. Schleifer</strong>",
			"So on the regulatory update, we don't comment on ongoing stuff. I'd like to say we're looking forward, hopefully, to the action of the FDA on June 27 and the launch promptly thereafter. Marion, you can comment on the inventories.",
			"<strong>Marion E. McCourt</strong>",
			"Sure, Tyler. I can give you the detail there. So while still within the normal range of inventory related to your question on EYLEA in the quarter in the normal range is 5 to 10 days, our inventory levels were approximately 3 days lower at the end of the first quarter of 2023 compared to the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. And when you do the calculation on that, as I'm sure you all will do, that's a negative impact in the first quarter net sales of approximately $70 million.",
			"<strong>Ryan Crowe</strong>",
			"Thanks, Marion and Tyler. Moving to the next question please, Josh.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.",
			"<strong>Terence C. Flynn</strong>",
			"I was just wondering on the commercial footprint for Dupixent here, given the potential for another indication with COPD. If you could talk about any additional footprint or spend that's required there. And again, maybe just how to think about leverage on the forward.",
			"<strong>Marion E. McCourt</strong>",
			"Sure, very happy to comment. And as we think of Dupixent and all the different therapeutic disease areas and specialists that we cover with some indications, there certainly is an amazing and wonderful synergy. And you give an example with COPD launch potentially. And obviously, today, we're in market with our asthma indication and with nasal polyps. As we look forward with COPD, it's a really important launch, an indication to help patients in a way potentially that, as George described, hasn't been achieved ever for this population.<br/>So we have the opportunity to use our existing footprint, specifically in covering respiratory specialists, pulmonologists. But we'll also evaluate very closely with Sanofi, as you've seen us done in dermatology indications, where we might need some additional coverage and where the synergy is adequate, and we'll be very disciplined and very thoughtful about that. But you can be assured that we'll make certain that we appropriately give commercialization effort to such an important indication of COPD.",
			"<strong>Leonard S. Schleifer</strong>",
			"And it's interesting, just to add a little bit to that, Marion, that the allergists seem to have really understood the concept of type 2 inflammation. And the fact that type 2 inflammation is not a collection of individual unrelated diseases, it's a collection of related diseases. <br/>And I was speaking to an allergist the other day and said when you take an asthma patient, if you look carefully, many of them will have nasal polyps. And if you talk to dermatologists, they're beginning to understand that when they're treating atopic dermatitis, people who have concomitant asthma, for example, they get a benefit there. <br/>So I think Dupixent really is kind of unique. And we are talking to the main doctors, including the allergists, the dermatologists and the pulmonologists, with some of the ENT, as Marion said. We're covering them all, and many of them are covering multiple diseases.",
			"<strong>Marion E. McCourt</strong>",
			"Yes. I'll add to the enthusiasm here too in COPD, the potential to have a second product following Dupixent as well. So this will be a very important future area for helping patients.",
			"<strong>Robert E. Landry</strong>",
			"So with regards to your question on leverage, first off, welcome back. Nice to have you back on the team. You'll see with the issuance of our 10-Q this morning with regards to our share of the antibody alliance, we're going to pick up quarter year-over-year for the quarter, roughly 300 basis points. And again, that's half the economics on the transaction. So we're beginning to see really great leverage in to Marion's comment that should continue on with the COPD indication.",
			"<strong>Leonard S. Schleifer</strong>",
			"Obviously, we work very closely with Sanofi and all of these. And I believe it's fair to say we're equally excited about the potential for the future of Dupixent in all the current and, hopefully, future indications.",
			"<strong>Ryan Crowe</strong>",
			"Thanks, everyone. Next question please, Josh.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Christopher Raymond with Piper Sandler.",
			"<strong>Christopher Joseph Raymond</strong>",
			"Maybe another Dupixent question, if you don't mind. Len, I know you don't talk about regulatory interactions. But when you had the COPD data, I think the signal that I got from you guys that seemed to be pretty strong was that you were hoping to have some discussions with the agency on BOREAS alone.<br/>Just kind of -- maybe can you map out how you anticipate communicating the results of that discussion with FDA once it happens? And then maybe a second part of that question is, our KOL checks have been pretty consistent when we asked them about this data. They're very impressed. But one of the things we've heard consistently is that this cutoff or clinical is to greater than 300 as sort of arbitrary and that this drug would see and maybe add value to patients with clinical accounts as low as 200 to 250. Just maybe your thoughts on this, and how you anticipate to sort of take advantage of that.",
			"<strong>Leonard S. Schleifer</strong>",
			"Yes. Well, let me start with the regulatory aspect. The -- obviously, what we're all staring at is an incredibly positive study -- I mean a Phase III setting, where, as we've mentioned, that we not only improve people's exacerbations, but we also improved their lung functions and the lung function and their quality of life, and all these other measures that were also part of the statistical hierarchy. <br/>So when you have a very robust study like that, and you have -- I don't know how many patients we currently have, but it's a huge number, a very large patient commercial database and so many indications, I think Sanofi and Regeneron concur, that this is something that we should be discussing with the FDA to see how they feel about whether or not there is a potential filing. We don't have any update for you, if it's something once we have that meeting, if it's something definitive, I'm sure Sanofi and Regeneron will figure out a way to properly communicate that. <br/>In terms of cutoffs and what have you, I think it's a little bit premature to talk about that, other than to say you stick with what you brought to the trial, which is a cutoff of 300. And that's where you commercialize. But the future work one can look at in other studies, that's something obviously we'll think about. But I remind you as George and both Marion mentioned, our IL-33 antibody gives a larger, although somewhat overlapping population potentially. So we really could have cover many, many, many patients, a great opportunity to help people with what has been really a very unfortunate progressive loss of lung function.",
			"<strong>Marion E. McCourt</strong>",
			"Yes. Len to your comment, you were talking about numbers of patients. I can fill in there that as of March worldwide, we had over 600,000 patients on Dupixent in 57 countries.",

			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets.",
			"<strong>Brian Corey Abrahams</strong>",
			"Shifting gears, you recently reported with your partner, APP data in Alzheimer's. I'm curious what this proof of principle potentially opens up beyond this indication? How quickly you can expand into some of the other neurodegenerative diseases that you mentioned, and your level of confidence overall in the safety of the program.",
			"<strong>George D. Yancopoulos</strong>",
			"Well, we think that the data were really game changing. I mean this is the first time in human history that one has been able to use this very exciting siRNA technology within the brain and silence, to a very high degree, higher-than-expected levels an important pathological gene. Obviously, this could have important implications for Alzheimer's itself. But as you point out, the application goes way beyond that. To every neurodegenerative disease, there are also other types of CNS diseases as well. We have a number of programs that we're working with Alnylam. We have an exclusive relationship with them on all of these CNS targets.<br/>And we're trying to expedite a lot of them based on the exciting results from this initial clinical work into the clinic. And we're also trying to expedite many of our programs that are behind as well. So we really think this opens up an entirely new way of addressing a whole assortment of brain diseases and neuropsychiatric diseases, not just neurodegenerative diseases. <br/>We're in exciting times. We have to go cautiously. We have to hope that the initial results, in terms of the safety profile and so forth, hold up. We're all in the early days, and we don't know for sure. But the low doses with which we saw this very marked reduction in the target give us a lot of hope that we can have a sufficient therapeutic window that will be applicable to these large variety of disease that could potentially be addressable by this modality.",
			"<strong>Leonard S. Schleifer</strong>",
			"So I just wanted to add to that, 2 things: streaming on a different channel, I think you might find some further data being discussed by our friends at Alnylam, which will speak to not only impressive result, but the durability of the effect. And one of the other things I want to comment is really to echo something George said. The recent amyloid plaque clearing antibody results by Lilly previously, by Biogen, are really quite important. But as George said, even with the adjuvant, there's still going to be a tremendous burden of Alzheimer's disease. <br/>But what the data seem to be speaking towards is that the process is ongoing, is that the pathologic role of amyloid is not over. And as George said, having another way, perhaps upstream, stopping the production of amyloid, maybe even a more advantageous way to deal with the ongoing process that amyloid seems to be generating, which is what the antibody data, I think, seems to be speaking to us.",
			"<strong>Ryan Crowe</strong>",
			"Okay, thank you. Josh, next question please.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs.",
			"<strong>Salveen Jaswal Richter</strong>",
			"So with regard to EYLEA high-dose becoming the larger share of revenue on the forward here, can you give us any color here on discussions with payers and how to think about formulary fit?",
			"<strong>Marion E. McCourt</strong>",
			"So Salveen, we are actively involved in all aspects of launch preparation. And certainly, that includes all elements and levers associated with premarket activities and then getting ready for the launch activities. We do have in place a very sophisticated market access, payer and pricing team. And at the appropriate times, they most definitely will be involved with payers and other organized customers that will be important in our launch efforts. Additionally, this is a customer base that we know very well from our -- over a decade experience with EYLEA, so we look forward to potential FDA approval and launch activities and working with all of our customer stakeholders. <br/>I'll also mention again the importance in the retinal space of the key opinion leaders and prescribers and the enthusiasm they have for a product that really can be a game changer for their patients in terms of visual acuity, duration and the safety profile they've come to know with EYLEA. So we're very enthusiastic and look forward to the launch opportunity, and we'll be ready.",
			"<strong>Ryan Crowe</strong>",
			"Okay. Next question, please.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Akash Tewari with Jefferies.",
			"<strong>Akash Tewari</strong>",
			"So just to clarify the moving parts on U.S. EYLEA, there was a 5% market share loss, a $70 million inventory impact and then lower price. Any color on what the net price impact was on the quarter, and how it should evolve in the back half of '23? And additionally, should we expect EYLEA market share to hold at 70% going forward, or potentially start to grow again as high-dose EYLEA launches?",
			"<strong>Marion E. McCourt</strong>",
			"So let me take some of the items, and others may want to jump in here, too. But first, I would say that some of the calculation related to market share shift is not exactly correct. There was some decline in the quarter, but not to the height that you mentioned. When I look at market shares through the entirety of the first quarter period, then as described, it is a more competitive market, a variety of, obviously, competitors, very low cost and others. And overall, EYLEA performance is in a very strong situation as we look today to planning for our future portfolio and the aflibercept 8-milligram launch. <br/>As to the specifics of pricing and calculation to the net, I can't give you specifics on that number. But I do think that we gave you some transparency on the overall item related to inventory, overall competitive pressures and then our preparation for our next launch in the category coming up shortly, we hope, following FDA approval.",
			"<strong>Leonard S. Schleifer</strong>",
			"Obviously, as Marion mentioned, on a sequential basis, demand was modestly up. So obviously, we were offset by the factors that Marion referred to.",
			"<strong>Ryan Crowe</strong>",
			"All right. Next question, please.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.",
			"<strong>Christopher Thomas Schott</strong>",
			"I just had a question on the IL-33 in COPD. I guess just the success you've had with your kind of study design and results with Dupixent increase at all your confidence in that program. And just, I guess, maybe just elaborate little bit on, how you see kind of those 2 agents kind of interacting as we think about the space overall?",
			"<strong>George D. Yancopoulos</strong>",
			"Yes. We are more optimistic, obviously, that all of our decisions, all of the data that led us to do the particular study and the particular population of patients in COPD with Dupixent was made based on a lot of factors. And we also had, from our Regeneron Genetics Center, very strong human genetic evidence suggesting that it would have activity particularly where we actually saw activity. And so all of that gives us confidence -- since we use the same criteria, the same approaches and so forth to plan and design our IL-33 study, certainly, the fact that everything that went into one and it all worked so remarkably well gives us confidence that the same approaches will lead to success with the IL-33. <br/>The results with Dupixent were really outstanding, as we've already mentioned. Not only a clinically meaningful reduction in exacerbations, but we hit all these other important endpoints, most importantly, improvement in lung function, as well as you rarely hit these quality of life improvements unless you have a really active agent that the patients can really feel the difference for their function and for their quality of life. <br/>With IL-33, the genetics is very strong. We have a Phase II study in the subgroup that we're doing the Phase III study in. It was in that group. We have demonstrated a 42% reduction in exacerbations in the Phase II study. This will be an overlapping population with our Dupixent population. We think we already have a chance to really make a huge difference for this high unmet need population that really has had no new mechanism of action of drugs brought to help these patients for a very, very long time. We have one with Dupixent, and we're hoping to hit another one with IL-33. And this could make such a huge difference for these patients who have been suffering for so long without much hope. It could really make a big difference for this population.",
			"<strong>Leonard S. Schleifer</strong>",
			"I just wanted to repeat, maybe George said it probably 2 or 3 times, but maybe it's worth saying a fourth time. In yesteryear, the way you did drug development is you identified a target based on some biology or what have you, you did your Phase I and Phase II, and you hope that Phase II was an indicator for how your Phase III was going to turn out. And obviously, that's how it is still done today. But what George mentioned is that we can layer on top of it in sort of a unique way our genetic insights and look and validate and say, is it reasonable to expect that if you block a certain target that you're going to have a beneficial effect? Is that target associated with the disease you're treating?<br/>And I know George said it 3 times, but I think it's worth saying a fourth time. That really gives you added confidence that's uniquely Regeneron in many respects, how we can get this genetic information. People ask us a lot, if you think about the number of people that have been sequenced in the world, George can comment when I'm done, I know we've sequenced a large part of them and coupled that with all this medical, anonymized medical information. We use that in so many ways, not only to identify targets, but to validate the work we're doing in specific targets, specific diseases. George, how much have we done?",
			"<strong>George D. Yancopoulos</strong>",
			"We've seen about half of all the humans who have been sequenced.",
			"<strong>Leonard S. Schleifer</strong>",
			"So I mean, that's a large database of millions. And I think that, that is what you're hearing is that that's why we had more confidence perhaps than others did with Dupixent and now with anti-IL-33.",
			"<strong>George D. Yancopoulos</strong>",
			"Since when expand it a little bit, just let you know how it works. What we do is we identify genetic variations that mimic the blocking of a drug or exacerbation of this type 2 pathway. And what we showed for Dupixent, for the genetic variations that mimic Dupixent, those people were protected from COPD, particularly the type 2 COPD patients. <br/>Whereas increased activity of the IL-4/13 path was associated with more disease. And obviously, that turned out to be the case. I mean it's human genetics. It's a very, very powerful predictor. And we've done the same thing, as Len said, with IL-33, where we have genetic variation at mimics blocking the pathway or exacerbating the pathway. And as I've said, this is one of the secrets to our ability to have high success rates in our studies is we use that as a criteria to make our decisions going forward.",
			"<strong>Ryan Crowe</strong>",
			"Okay. Thank you. Next question please, Josh.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Yatin Suneja with Guggenheim Securities.",
			"<strong>Eddie Hickman</strong>",
			"This is Eddie Hickman on for Yatin. I was wondering if you could talk about the draft guidance from the FDA on the anti-VEGF trial designs? And if that impacts your outlook on the high-dose program at all?",
			"<strong>Leonard S. Schleifer</strong>",
			"I don't think that has any impact on us, on our program.",
			"<strong>Ryan Crowe</strong>",
			"Thank you, Len. Next question, please.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from David Risinger with SVB Securities.",
			"<strong>David Reed Risinger</strong>",
			"Yes. And I guess I'll just go straight to the question. Len, you had mentioned in your opening remarks the ongoing diversification of the company's revenues away from EYLEA. Could you please discuss your expectations for EYLEA U.S. sales growth in the near term, including the total EYLEA franchise prospects after Regeneron launches the HD?",
			"<strong>Leonard S. Schleifer</strong>",
			"Let me go right to the answer since you ran right to the question. We don't give future guidance on specific quantitative measures of our sales. On a qualitative basis, Marion has said, that we're anticipating that the combination of EYLEA and 8 milligrams aflibercept will be a growth franchise over time for the company.",
			"<strong>Ryan Crowe</strong>",
			"Okay, thank you. Next question, please.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Hartaj Singh with Oppenheimer.",
			"<strong>Hartaj Singh</strong>",
			"Just a quick question on linvoseltamab. At ASH, you presented a Phase I data, and these were your dose ranging, I guess, data. Really interesting data you present at ASH. At ASCO, what should we expect to see? Will it be dose expansion data? And then any duration also on the patients from ASH? And then what would FDA like to see before you can go ahead and submit the application?",
			"<strong>George D. Yancopoulos</strong>",
			"Well, I think you're going to actually see an update on our pivotal Phase II data, the actual data that was a little bit more maturing, with a further update we will be hoping to submit to the FDA for our BLA. So the data will be very close. We think the data will even get better as it matures. Because as we all know, response rates and so forth get better with time as you follow these patients. But these data are going to show what we believe are the potential to have best-in-class efficacy, as well as safety in the favorable dosing schedule based on the results that we'll show from our pivotal study at the upcoming ASCO.",
			"<strong>Ryan Crowe</strong>",
			"All right. Thank you, George. I think we have time for 2 more questions.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays.",
			"<strong>Carter Lewis Gould</strong>",
			"Sorry to belabor EYLEA. I guess just simply, what's the pricing pressure that you guys highlighted in Q1. Was that a seasonal dynamic? Or would you characterize it as that? Or something more permanent around that market landscape going forward?",
			"<strong>Leonard S. Schleifer</strong>",
			"Before Marion answers that, I just want to come back to the BCMA story a little bit, because it's one that I'm particularly excited about. The bispecific field, which was initiated by Regeneron in terms of using bispecifics, I think we were the first to put the bispecific into patients, has obviously become a very crowded space and it's sometimes hard to differentiate what you've got compared to what the competition has and you look at somebody claiming one thing and you're claiming another and so on and so forth. <br/>But if you take a dispassionate view, I think for the BCMAxCD3 program, you could really see a differentiated molecule and the potential to be best-in-class. Antibodies are not all created equal. Bispecifics are not all created equally. You do see differences. Clinical trial programs and not all created equally. This is one I'd really encourage you to think a very careful look at and compare. Now there was some question on EYLEA. Marion, you're going to answer that.",
			"<strong>Marion E. McCourt</strong>",
			"Sure. And Carter, getting back to your question on the competitive dynamic and pricing pressure. I think if you look at the anti-VEGF category and look at it over time, go back multiple quarters, there has been increasing competitive pressure. And that does then have a corollary to some extent on pricing dynamic, and that would go forward. <br/>But I just want to share and remind all that in the category, in the VEGF category, what really is rewarded is product profile. And as we look at a product like EYLEA that launched and was a game changer in the category, that was profile not being the least costly, right? There's been a low-cost alternative, very low-cost alternative for a very, very long time, but it was the product profile that made the difference for prescribers and patients. <br/>So that will always be a very important dynamic to look at going forward, and certainly has strong interest for prescribers as we bring a new product into the marketplace following FDA approval with aflibercept 8 milligram. But to your point, pricing pressure will continue in this category. But what's most important is product profile and the clinical attributes that the patient experiences.",
			"<strong>Ryan Crowe</strong>",
			"Thanks. Last question, please.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our last question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO.",
			"<strong>Evan David Seigerman</strong>",
			"I'd love to have you expand on some of the feedback you've been hearing from physicians regarding the 8-milligram dose. Maybe some color as to how they plan on using it and assuming approval comes June.",
			"<strong>Marion E. McCourt</strong>",
			"So of course, the updates on actual prescribing will be even more important as the product comes into the marketplace and physicians have an opportunity to use it and select patients. We obviously have done a lot of work with our medical team, looked at the clinical data with specialists. And to give you an early answer to your question, I think there's opportunity for a variety of patients that are deemed to be appropriate candidates. And there's a range. Certainly, when physicians are considering new patient starts, it's very attractive. <br/>We obviously have a strong portion of patients that are naive to EYLEA today, but in the future, the question becomes, why wouldn't you start a new patient with a product that gives you all the visual acuity benefits and safety of EYLEA, but it also gives you that durability and duration? Because obviously, physicians know their patients are anxious and don't like to have more injections in the eye than they need to. Similarly, you might have a patient that's very well controlled on another product, maybe EYLEA, maybe another product in the anti-VEGF category. But you'd like to give them that opportunity for duration and, maybe in some cases, if the product is in another area of the anti-VEGF category, improved visual acuity and duration. <br/>So I would say it's the combination of interest for patients who might be broadly anti-VEGF category switch patients, or the potential for new patients as well. I hope that helps, and I look forward to the day when we can give you specifics for market experience.",

			"Thank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter earnings call for 2023. Today, we reported solid first quarter results of 4% operational growth in revenue as expected, based on our diverse portfolio and strength in international markets. As we indicated in February, we expected a softer first quarter and a stronger growth for the remainder of the year, and we are reiterating our full year guidance for operational growth of 6% to 8% in revenue and 7% to 9% in adjusted net income given the underlying strength of the pet care market. In the first quarter, our International segment led the way, growing revenue 10% operationally and was partially offset by a 1% decline in the U.S. <br/>Our livestock portfolio drove the results with 12% operational growth in revenue, while companion animal product revenues were flat operationally. The performance in livestock was based on double-digit operational growth for cattle, poultry, sheep and fish.<br/>In the case of U.S. cattle, this performance was supported by an improvement in the supply of key products. Meanwhile, our companion animal portfolio in the U.S. declined due to distributor destocking and reducing their inventories in the first quarter as well as higher purchases in the fourth quarter of 2022, which occurred in anticipation of price increases and based on promotional programs. We see strong end market demand in companion animal channels based on data from veterinary clinics, retailers and pet owners. And we view distributor inventories as a short-term impact on our companion animal sales.<br/>For example, while our sales into distributors declined in the quarter as we expected, our product sales from distributors out to veterinary clinics were up approximately 8%, and our product sales out of retail channels to pet owners were up about 35%, affirming a healthy pet care market in the U.S.<br/>Pet owner demand for product is expected to grow during the second quarter, pulling through more inventory and allowing purchase patterns by distributors to become more aligned with the underlying demand throughout the year.<br/>Other dynamics in the U.S. vet clinics also continue to show momentum and trending in a positive direction. Clinic visits increased 2% in the first quarter, showing an increase for the first time since 2021. Meanwhile, clinic revenue and average spend per visit continue to grow even in the face of inflationary pressures.<br/>Revenue and average dollars per visit increased 11% and 9%, respectively, in the quarter. The combination of evolving pet owner demographics, innovative medicines and an unbreakable human animal bond, all continue to support a positive and growing companion animal market where we lead. Despite the Q1 distributor issues in the U.S., our overall growth was driven by strength in international markets, which delivered 10% operational revenue growth in both livestock and companion animal portfolios.<br/>This quarter's results are a testament once again to how our diverse portfolio and geographic presence helped deliver steady and predictable growth. <br/>Turning now to adjusted net income. We saw a decline of 3% operationally in the first quarter, which was in line with our expectations. The first quarter reflected significant investments in our U.S. pet care field force and shifts in the go-to-market model for diagnostics, costs, which were not incurred fully in the year ago quarter. We also saw increased investments in R&amp;D, which we have discussed previously. The investments in diagnostics are maturing and gaining traction in the U.S., and we continue to grow and expand outside the U.S. We expect a return to growth in U.S. diagnostics for the year as we build our VetScan Imagyst AI platform, refine and grow our reference lab business and bring further innovative offerings to the space.<br/>Looking ahead, we see strong demand driving double-digit operational growth for our innovative companion animal portfolio and relatively flat operational growth in our livestock portfolio this year. We will continue to invest in the franchises and capabilities that support our future growth, including large and growing product areas like parasiticides, dermatology, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines and diagnostics. For example, we continue to build out key product franchises through life cycle innovations and claim extensions in products like Simparica Trio, Cytopoint and DRAXXIN.<br/>We are also expanding our global reach with approvals in additional markets for new livestock vaccines, like Protivity, for beef and dairy calves and Lawsotek for swine. And most recently, we purchased a manufacturing site outside Atlanta, Georgia, which will be used as a new monoclonal antibody vaccine and pet care product operation to add capacity for our expected growth.<br/>As you know, our monoclonal antibody and vaccine platforms are rapidly growing, and this new site would substantially expand manufacturing capacity for our biologics portfolio and ensure long-term supply across all global markets when it begins operations in 2026.<br/>While the overall economic uncertainty remains a headwind globally in 2020, '23, we have proven to be up to any challenge. We have learned valuable lessons and built new muscles, especially over the last 3 years, developing more agility, flexibility and resilience in our business and our people. Despite the unusual mix of results in our first quarter, I continue to feel very positive about our full year guidance and how our diverse portfolio and vision for the future of animal health can drive long-term sustainable growth and create value for our customers and shareholders. We will continue to be disciplined, yet adaptable, and our approach to the opportunities, potential challenges and economic shifts that could occur throughout the year.<br/>We remain committed to delivering strong growth in 2023 based on our market leadership, innovative franchises and diverse portfolio, while continuing to invest for the future.<br/>Thank you. Now let me hand this off to Wetteny. Wetteny?",
			"<strong>Wetteny N. Joseph</strong>",
			"Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. We had a solid start to the year with growth driven by our livestock business and strong international market performance. Echoing Kristin's comment, our Q1 results are in line with our expectations. As we indicated on our Q4 earnings call, we expected the first quarter to be below the low end of our forecasted annual operational growth rate of 6% for 2023. In the first quarter, we generated revenue of $2 billion, growing 1% on a reported basis and 4% on an operational basis.<br/>Adjusted net income of $607 million declined 3% on both a reported and on an operational basis. Of the 4% operational revenue growth, 5% is from price, with a 1% decline in volume. The volume decline is driven primarily by U.S. companion animal distributor destocking in the quarter.<br/>Our livestock portfolio led the way in terms of species growth, growing 12% operational only with companion animal revenues flat on an operational basis in the quarter. Livestock growth was broad-based with double-digit operational growth across cattle, poultry, sheep and fish. The growth in cattle was driven by additional supply of key products in the U.S. We saw growth in our poultry portfolio driven by higher sales of vaccines. Our sheep products benefited from favorable market conditions in Australia as well as our acquisition of Jurox in the fourth quarter of 2022. Finally, our fish portfolio continues to perform well with double-digit operational growth driven by strong vaccine performance in Norway.<br/>Sales of our companion animal products were flat operationally in the quarter with growth in our monoclonal antibody products, Cytopoint, Librela and Solensia, offsetting declines in Apoquel, parasiticides and anti-infectives. Our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, Librela and Solensia, posted $51 million in revenue globally in the quarter with strong demand for both products.<br/>Additionally, Solensia benefited from our U.S. launch in the third quarter last year. As for Librela in the U.S., we still anticipate approval in the first half of this year, with the launch later in the second half. Simparica Trio posted global revenue of $151 million in the quarter, representing an operational decline of 7% versus the comparable 2022 period. This was primarily the result of U.S. distributor destocking during the quarter, as well as preprice increase buying and promotional activity during the fourth quarter.<br/>This decline was partially offset by growth in our international markets from increased unit penetration and launches in new markets. Our key dermatology portfolio declined 3% operationally with $290 million in global revenue. This decline is attributed to the impact of preprice increased buy-ins in the U.S. in Q4 and in Japan in the comparable period in 2022. Cytopoint partially offset this decline with double-digit growth based on continued veterinary preference for injectables, which keep revenues in the clinic. Cytopoint better reflects underlying market demand due to our direct sales model on our dermatology portfolio and the lack of retail channel impacts. While we do believe conversion from Apoquel to Cytopoint may be accelerating, our overall outlook for our key dermatology portfolio remains unchanged. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio declined 3% operationally with declines in the U.S., partially offset by growth internationally. <br/>Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1 billion in the quarter, declining 1% with companion animal products declining 7% and livestock sales growing 15%. Companion animal performance in the quarter is reflective of the expectations we set in the prior quarter and is a result of distributor inventory and promotional impacts. As Kristin mentioned, demand for the veterinary market, as demonstrated by distributor sales to clinics is healthy and growing. We continue to see robust sales outgrowth across our companion animal portfolio, including strong growth in parasiticides and our key dermatology products and our outlook for the full year remains unchanged.<br/>U.S. vet practice trends are improving with clinic visits up 2% in the quarter and clinic revenue growth up 11%. Average revenue per visit is up 9%. These trends are slightly better than we expected and largely reflect the normalization of the COVID impact on vet clinic visits. Total business in the quarter remained above pre-pandemic levels and clinic revenues have grown an average of 10% annually over that period. Spend per visit remains elevated as the standard of care continues to increase. <br/>Turning to product performance. The companion animal decline in the U.S. was driven largely by a decrease in sales of our parasiticide portfolio as well as key dermatology products. Simparica Trio sales of $127 million in the quarter, declining 13%, driven by distributor destocking, partially offset by growth in patient share, where we continue to outpace the over -- the oral flea, tick and heartworm market. Our outlook for Trio remains unchanged as we continue to see strong customer demand and continued conversion from topicals and collars.<br/>Key dermatology products sales were $184 million for the quarter, declining 5%. Apoquel sales were negatively impacted by high sales in Q4 ahead of our 2023 price increases and significant retail buy-in in Q1 2022. Cytopoint sales growth partially offset the Apoquel decline due largely to its injectable administration, which is preferred by clinics. The U.S. companion animal decline was partially offset by growth in sales of Solensia, which launched in the third quarter. We continue to see solid cleaning penetration growth in Solensia and expect to drive awareness of feline OA through our DTC advertising campaigns.<br/>U.S. livestock grew 15% in the quarter, primarily resulting from our cattle business where we have improved several supply outages, which impacted our revenues throughout 2022 and replenished our channel partner inventories. While we will continue to see benefit from improved supply, the replenishment impact is largely isolated to this quarter.<br/>We also saw growth in Suvaxyn due to expanded label claims. Our poultry business also contributed to growth, driven by expanded sales of vaccines. Moving on to our International segment, where revenue grew 3% on a reported basis and 10% operationally in the quarter, with companion animal and livestock revenue both growing 10%.<br/>Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from our monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of osteoarthritis pain, small animal parasiticides as well as the impact of our Jurox acquisition, which was completed in the fourth quarter of last year.<br/>We continue to be encouraged by the performance of Librela and Solensia. Librela generated $34 million or 74% operational growth driven by strong underlying demand and the removal of supply allocations that were in place for the first half of 2022. Solensia delivered $9 million in the first quarter sales internationally, driven by stronger demand. Simparica Trio was the top contributor to growth for our international small animal parasiticides with $24 million in revenue, growing 47% operationally due to expanding market share in the fleet, tick and heartworm space.<br/>Our international key dermatology portfolio was flat operationally in the quarter. We saw double-digit operational growth across most of our major markets, driven by higher compliance and new patients. However, this growth was offset by large prepriced buy-ups of Apoquel in Japan in Q1 2022. Our international livestock segment also grew 10% operationally in the quarter with growth in 4 of our 5 core species.<br/>Growth was driven by our cattle portfolio, which benefited from price increases in certain emerging markets. Our sheep business had an exceptional quarter with high demand in Australia due to favorable market conditions as well as the impact of our Jurox acquisition. Poultry also contributed to growth in the quarter with higher key account penetration in the Middle East and Eastern Europe as well as the benefit of price.<br/>And lastly, our fish portfolio continues to perform well, driven by growth in salmon vaccines in Norway. Swine was flat for the quarter with strong sales in China, partially offset by intermittent supply constraints in some markets.<br/>Now moving on to the rest of the P&amp;L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 70.8% declined 80 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year, resulting from higher manufacturing costs and unfavorable product mix. This was partially offset by favorable foreign exchange and price increases. Adjusted operating expenses increased 12% operationally with SG&amp;A growth of 11% operationally, driven by headcount-related compensation costs as a result of our U.S. small animal field force expansion, which largely began in Q2 of 2022 and higher T&amp;E.<br/>R&amp;D grew 19% on an operational basis, driven by higher project spend for our pipeline candidates. Advancing projects include disruptive novel innovation and life cycle management. R&amp;D remains our first priority in capital allocation.<br/>Other income introductions in the quarter are reflective of a favorable benefit associated with the settlement in the current period for prior period underpaid royalties related to sales of certain products. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.5%, an increase of 160 basis points, driven by lower net discrete tax benefits in the quarter and less favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings, partially offset by a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income.<br/>And finally, adjusted net income declined 3% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS declined 1% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $223 million. We are still anticipating a significant increase in capital expenditures for the full year 2023. We continue to make investments to support our future growth, including manufacturing capacity for monoclonal antibodies as well as oral solid dosage.<br/>In the quarter, we repurchased $283 million of Zoetis shares and grew a dividend over 15% versus Q1 2022.<br/>Now moving on to guidance for the full year 2023. As we have mentioned, the first quarter has gone largely as we expected. We are therefore reaffirming our 2023 guidance provided during February's earnings call. Note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late April. Foreign exchange rates have been volatile over the quarter. We will continue to monitor the impact of this volatility going forward.<br/>For the year, we continue to expect revenue between $8.575 billion and $8.725 billion, representing a range of 6% to 8% operational growth. We also continue to expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.49 billion to $2.54 billion, representing operational growth of 7% to 9%. And finally, we expect this adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.03 to $5.14, both consistent with our February guidance. <br/>Just to summarize before we go to Q&amp;A. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full year guidance commitments and expect more normalized growth in subsequent quarters. We continue to see positive trends and solid fundamentals in the underlying demand and are confident that our innovative portfolio will continue to allow us to grow in line with or faster than the market.<br/>Now, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Jon Block with Stifel.",
			"<strong>Jonathan David Block</strong>",
			"I will ask both upfront. I think importantly, is the channel now normalized in the U.S., Kristin, and then some rough crude math. But if you were down 7%, U.S. companion animal and sales out were up 8%, it's like a 1,500 basis point delta. And I sort of landed over $100 million in sales if you quantify that. So can you guys bridge how you get there? I guess there's the $25 million to $30 million of parasit last quarter. Are the (inaudible) working down inventory by a week, whatever you can do to bridge that would be helpful. And then a quick one, and easier one. Librela, I think you said approval still expected 1H. So launch 2H, is that the full launch, call it, before the end of the year. And then, again, Kristin, how do you feel in your ability to serve demand, we believe there's a lot of Solensia users that are chomping at the bit to get at it. So do you expect U.S. Librela supply to be an issue at all, call it, 1H, '24.",
			"<strong>Kristin C. Peck</strong>",
			"Sure, Jon. I'll start with your second question. It's pretty straightforward. Yes, we continue to expect approval of Librela in the first half with the launch in the second half. The timing of exactly that a full launch. We would -- obviously, we've always said do early experience first and then go to a full launch. The full launch could be very late in the year. But as we continue to -- and I'll reiterate again, the Librela is not in our numbers for the year. We do not include in our numbers for the year, a product that's expected to launch very late in the year. for obvious reasons. So we would do early experience as we've always done with a full launch. We did a full launch very late in the year based on what we're saying. And no, we do not anticipate any supply challenges on a full launch in 2024, whether it's late this year or early 2024, we don't see any challenges there.<br/>On your second question on distributor, I think we'll spend a bunch of time on that today. Obviously, there's a lot of complexity in that one. But again, it is in line with what we expected. And we really don't think the trend you see in the quarter is going to continue. Let me get Wetteny get into all the details because I know this is probably the biggest question we've been hearing early this morning. So Wetteny, do you want to go through some of the details?",
			"<strong>Wetteny N. Joseph</strong>",
			"Sure. John, the start of your question was, are we at normalized levels. So I'll start there first. And yes, we're at normalized levels here sitting here in the second quarter. And let me just step back and give you a little bit more details here. As Kristin said, we came into the year and as you may recall on the last call, we described how we saw increased buying in the fourth quarter, driven by promotions that we ran on parasiticides given we have recovery of supply late in the year as we go through some of our supply constraints. And there was more prepriced buying given the level of price increases were coming into 2023 with in the fourth quarter above what I would call normal levels of prepriced buying. So we expected to see destocking in the quarter, which is why we said that the first quarter would be below the low end of the range of growth that we have for the year at 6% to 8%.<br/>So we've seen destocking in the first quarter down to, I would say, the lower end of our normal range that we've experienced historically. And as we step into -- and by the way, given rising interest rates, that is not unexpected. And then as we got into April, we saw slightly more destocking as we started the quarter, but those have normalized and have been reflected in the guidance that we just reiterated today. And so we're not anticipating a return back to normal levels in terms of inventory. So our assumption in our guidance is that they'll stay about where they are now.<br/>Now to be clear, if you look at the end market demand dynamics, they remain very strong. As we said in our earnings release, sales out of distributors into clinics were up 8% on a volume basis in the quarter. And if you look at retail, sales out to pet owners were up 35% on the quarter.<br/>We've seen, for the first time in about a year, vet visit increased by 2%. And if you look at derm patients, for example, visits increased in the quarter versus a year ago. And so again, we've seen normalization since then. And by the way, in international markets, where we didn't see, we haven't seen and don't expect to see the level of destocking that we've seen in the U.S., you saw 10% operational growth in our international markets across livestock and companion animal. And so again, [with an extremely return] to those levels, and these are factored into our guidance, and we're contemplated when we gave the initial guidance back in February.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And we will take our next question from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.",
			"<strong>Erin Elizabeth Wilson Wright</strong>",
			"Great. Two questions, one on livestock, one on companion. So on the livestock side, was there a stocking benefit across livestock in the segment in the quarter? Can you quantify that for us and how much of the strength in U.S. livestock should continue in the coming quarters given that you expect flat for the year. And you touched on derm a little bit on the companion animal side, but you mentioned Apoquel declined with no competitors in that segment and your direct distribution strategy. What drove the decline? And does that volatility that you're seeing across that retail channel for this product change how you think about leveraging that alternative channel? And are you proactively shifting customers decide a point ahead of competition?",
			"<strong>Kristin C. Peck</strong>",
			"Sure. Thanks, Erin. Again, livestock did grow 12%, as you mentioned, which was in line with what we expected. But the growth really was driven by resupply or increased supply of a lot of key products. As we reiterated in our prepared remarks, we continue to expect a flattish growth for livestock for the year. If you look at it, we saw, if you look at the U.S. business, we think you'll see it's really more of a onetime sort of getting back into supply and some of this. If it's slightly up or slightly down, I think a lot of that is genuinely going to depend on China.<br/>With this return to travel and dining out in China will drive growth in a number of our markets around the world, in our export markets such as Brazil or Australia or even the U.S. So we continue to expect and built into our guidance for the year is to have a flattish livestock number, which obviously gets back to Wetteny's point, which is we're expecting very strong double-digit growth in companion animal.<br/>As you look at derm for the quarter, it did decline, but this is largely due to the destocking of the preprice buy-ins and promotions in the U.S. And as Wetteny mentioned in his remarks, the onetime issue in Japan back to Q1 of 2022. In fact, if you pull that out, International had double-digit growth if you take out Japan. So again, this performance was in line with our expectations, but really importantly, it is not indicative of our view of our expectations for the year.<br/>We continue to expect double-digit growth for the rest of the year and for the overall year for dermatology. Our sales out remain really strong. We're seeing a lot of uptake right now in Cytopoint. More and more pet owners are really seeing the compliance benefits of it, the efficacy of it and vets love it because it obviously stays in the clinic. As we continue to see the shift here with compliance, I think, again, will underscore our growth there. And the other thing I'd mention, that Wetteny mentioned is, derm visits continue to grow in Q1. And we're not really seeing any pushback from customers on the price increases that we did do. So we continue to expect strong growth for derm for the year for our last guidance, double-digit growth for derm.",
			"<strong>Wetteny N. Joseph</strong>",
			"Yes. I would just add, the first quarter is not indicative of the year here, Erin, similar to the overall results. And so to your point around retail channels, et cetera, we don't see us changing that. I think the fact that Cytopoint, we expect to continue to lead the growth for key derm franchise will change the mix between those 2, but not changing the overall picture. And our expectations for derm remain the same for the rest of the year, and we're off to actually a strong start in the second quarter for derm, both in the U.S. and internationally.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And we will take our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America.",
			"<strong>Michael Leonidovich Ryskin</strong>",
			"Great. First, I want to ask about sort of the top line progression through the rest of the year. I think you had pointed to some softness like you previously and you talked about just now let me on when you saw distributors to start the second quarter. But any additional color you could give us as sort of we go through the rest of the year, given there is a relatively steep ramp implied in numbers right now, just to hit your $8.65 billion and 6% to 8% operational growth. So just talk about the step-up in 2Q -- 1Q to 2Q versus 2Q to 3Q, 4Q. And then as a follow-on to that, Kristin, you touched on Librela earlier, but I was wondering if you guys could comment on the other product launch expected this year. The competitor to Simparica Trio. We haven't seen that yet. Obviously, it can come any day, but just curious what you're hearing on that?<br/>And if your thoughts on what's going on in parasiticide market have changed regarding to that in terms of what some of your competitors are doing with stocking, what some of your competitors are doing with promotions of some of their products and sort of how that's impacting your view on tariff through the rest of the year?",
			"<strong>Wetteny N. Joseph</strong>",
			"Mike, I'll start with the progression for top line for the year, and then I'll turn it over to Kristin and she'll cover Librela launch and Trio competition. So with respect to progression for the balance of the year, we expect normalized growth across the year, starting with the second quarter, which, obviously, we're already about halfway into the second quarter. And as I mentioned just a little bit ago, we've got a strong start, particularly in derm, but across the board, to what I'll call more normalized mix and normalized cadence for the balance of the year. One thing I would say is with respect to Q2, and that normalized operational growth rate I'm referring to. If you take a look at FX, for example, that was about 3 points of headwind in the first quarter based on where rates are right now, I would expect about 2 points of headwind on the second quarter.<br/>So when you map out operational growth to reported growth, you should take that into consideration. That turns around in the second half, again, based on where rates are now. And it ends up being slightly unfavorable in the year year-on-year on FX on the top line and slightly favorable at the bottom line.<br/>So that's how I would sort of think through the progression. But again, starting with the second quarter, you should expect normalized growth to get to the guidance that we just reiterated at 6% to 8%.",
			"<strong>Kristin C. Peck</strong>",
			"Sure. And let me pick up your second question, which was the other products. We are continuing to expect competition in the second half of the year for Simparica Trio. But I want to underscore that as you look at the first quarter, we actually gained share. So as we said, there's very strong underlying demand for Simparica Trio in the U.S. and even with competition coming. If you look at our performance, it was in line with our expectations. Again, we said it's not indicative of the year. And we continue to expect strong growth for the remainder of the year, even with competition in the second half.<br/>So we have been expecting this competition. The good news is it's later than we did expect. As we think about it, we've talked about this before, we're not expecting them to radically change any pricing if they would really -- I think given they are the leader right now with HEARTGARD, NexGard, they would really cannibalize their own business. And I think it's important to keep in mind, even if you look at the quarter, they ran very strong promotions ahead of their launch. And even with those promotions, we gained share in that quarter. So we remain very confident in the strength of Simparica Trio and the strength of our relationships with vets in the pet owner satisfaction of it, we do expect competition. We think they'll bring a product, as I said, in the second half of the year, but we remain confident of the strong growth for Simparica Trio, as we said before, for the year.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And we will take our next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.",
			"<strong>Nathan Allen Rich</strong>",
			"Sorry to keep honing in on the destocking dynamics, but could you maybe just talk about how the first quarter U.S. companion animal sales kind of played out month by month? It seems like January and February price saw the bulk of the impact from the pre-buying and pull forward into the fourth quarter. Sounded like the destocking might have occurred a little bit later in the quarter. I think this is people are looking to get better visibility on the improvement in the second quarter. Could you maybe just comment on how March or April played out just as we think about kind of where the business is heading into the second quarter?",
			"<strong>Wetteny N. Joseph</strong>",
			"Yes. So look, I'll be happy to answer the question of destocking. Look, we saw destocking from the start of the quarter, just as we anticipated and as we discussed on the prior call, given the dynamics coming out of Q4. As we mentioned, too, in the last call, the timing of our supply recovery in terms of last year would have had an impact on the cadence on the year, which we -- which is playing out exactly as we thought. I'll give you a little bit more color perhaps that might be helpful if you think about what the end market demand looks like. When we look at our sales out of distribution to clinics, we said it's 8% volume growth in the quarter.<br/>If you look at how those played out for March, at the end of the quarter, they're actually above that number for us. So we haven't seen anything in terms of what the end markets are that would indicate a slowdown. And as I said, we've had a strong start to the second quarter, and we're sitting here in the middle of the second quarter and are saying that we would see normalized growth starting in this current quarter for the balance of the year.",
			"<strong>Kristin C. Peck</strong>",
			"Yes. And I think I want to also reiterate what Wetteny said earlier, which is -- they are at very low levels, the lower end of their ranges, but our guidance expects that they do not go back up. We believe that given the current interest rate environment, our expectation is that they will stay at this level. So again, our confidence in the guidance we're providing is assuming that they're not going back up, they will stay at the levels that they're at now.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And we will go next to Louise Chen with Cantor.",
			"<strong>Louise Alesandra Chen</strong>",
			"So I wanted to ask you on your upcoming investor event. What will you discuss here? What are some of the key things that you're going to be going over. It's been a while since you have had an investor event? And will you be disclosing more additional pipeline products, longer-term guidance, anything from that front? And then I also wanted to ask you on your diagnostics business, what's the outlook for the remainder of the year on that business?",
			"<strong>Kristin C. Peck</strong>",
			"Sure. We are excited for our Investor Day. We spent the time talking to a lot of our investors over the last 6 months as to what they're looking about. Our focus there will be really on building confidence in our medium- to long-term growth expectations. We've gotten a lot of questions, obviously, on our pipeline in R&amp;D. So you'll see us, as we mentioned in our press release, Rob Polzer, our Head of R&amp;D, will be coming to give more detail on our R&amp;D portfolio. And we also look forward to introducing you to other members of our leadership team. So you get to meet them as well. We're excited to sort of share what we view as the short, medium and long-term growth aspirations and give you some confidence in more detail around all of those. So Wetteny, do you want to take her second question of diagnostics?",
			"<strong>Wetteny N. Joseph</strong>",
			"Yes, happy to, Kristin. So look, on diagnostics, we have seen increased productivity from our diagnostics team, particularly as you look at the U.S. where we made the change about a year ago into the second quarter. In this first quarter, we actually saw very strong placements across our instruments, including images, as well. Those will help drive growth from a consumables perspective, as I look at the rest of the year. <br/>Consistent with our guidance, we said we would expect to see improvements in terms of that to the productivity given the new field force and the change out that we did last year, and we would expect to see return to growth in the U.S. in the back half of this year. And again, we're lapping those changes that we made, which we believe -- firmly believe are going to drive long-term growth for the business in addition to innovation that we continue to work on in terms of diagnostics.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And we will take our next question from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler.",
			"<strong>David Michael Westenberg</strong>",
			"So just on the Simparica Trio franchise and sort of the distributor dynamics here. I usually think about the parasiticide portfolio as being heavy in March to August season. As we take a step back or take a zoom outlook, do you think any of the dynamics that have happened with some of the distributor destocking is going to be a net negative for the annual sales of the product. <br/>Put another way, do you think -- maybe this impacts the timing of missing the flea and tick season in any of this kind of dynamic? And then just to reiterate on the inventory question on the livestock portfolio. It doesn't have the same dynamics, right? So I mean, like the price increases in livestock were not the same as the price increases in companion. Therefore, you wouldn't see some of that same distributor dynamic. And then if I could squeeze just one more. I just don't want to -- I didn't see the inventory or the balance sheet yet. So just wanted to see if inventory levels trended up or down.",
			"<strong>Kristin C. Peck</strong>",
			"Sure. Let me start with Trio and then I'll let Wetteny take the other 2. I want to underscore what we said earlier. We have very strong demand in sales out. And so what you saw in Trio in the first quarter was a stocking issue, but as we look at the demand for the product and where it's going, it has no effect on the flea and ticks because we meet it. We had full supply in. I think what makes it a little complicated and as unusual was the supply issues we had in Q3, Q2 and Q3 of 2022 put us putting a lot more inventory into the channel at the end of Q4, trying to restack shelves against what we thought as you remember, it was going to be a launch in Q1 of a competitor.<br/>So I think there's obviously some quarter-to-quarter stocking dynamics, but I want to underscore, demand for this product remains strong. We gained share in the quarter. We are now at normal inventory levels. So no, we do not see anything if you look at the Q2 to Q3 of the product which we would agree that is normally Q2 to Q3 is the strongest sales normally in parasiticide. So we continue to see very strong demand for the product. Obviously, there is some quarter-to-quarter stocking stuff that is relatively unique. As you looked at the end of 2022 and the beginning of 2023. But we don't think that actually signals to anything in the demand for the product or importantly, the strong growth we see for the product for the year, even as we said, assuming competition in the second half.",
			"<strong>Wetteny N. Joseph</strong>",
			"Yes. Look, I think there were a couple of other parts to your question. I'll touch on in terms of livestock. We're not seeing the same dynamics in livestock. Look, I think if you look at where we ended last year, maybe we're in the middle of the range towards the bottom of the range might have been slightly increase in the quarter given the recovery of some supply for certain products, as we mentioned in our prepared commentary. But overall, not any meaningful movement there to speak of. And then with respect to our balance sheet, on inventory, as you know, we are ramping up certain products, anticipating launch and approval of certain other products that will continue to drive inventories for us. If you look at operating cash flows on the quarter, they're actually favorable to last year, because as inventories continue to increase, we saw really strong performance on receivables and other NAP. So overall, operating cash flows look favorable versus a year ago. .",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And we will take our next question from Balaji Prasad with Barclays.",
			"<strong>Balaji V. Prasad</strong>",
			"A couple from me. Firstly, could you give an update on the supply chain issues, which impacted growth in 2022, be it on the vaccine side or Trio? And would you foresee anticipate any supply chain issue impacting any of your key products this year. Secondly, I wasn't sure I got the derm decline fully. This is not a distributed dependent segment. Can you provide some numbers around the derm segment and help us understand what led to the decline?",
			"<strong>Kristin C. Peck</strong>",
			"Sure. I'll start with your first question on supply chain and maybe Wetteny can build on my derm answer from before. With regard to the supply chain, as we expected, we have completely normalized the supply chain. We always have some small level of challenges, as we mentioned before in the biologics. But the challenges we saw in 2022 have been resolved as we indicated they would be. We're back into normal supply on these products as you look at whether that's parasiticides or importantly our monoclonal antibodies, as expected, those are at normalized levels. We'll have some small number in bios as we always have that all of our competitors generally have. But supply chain has been normalized and we don't foresee any specific supply chain challenges in 2023 going forward. But maybe Wetteny you can build on my previous comments on derm and see if you can clarify some of those questions.",
			"<strong>Wetteny N. Joseph</strong>",
			"Yes, I'd be happy to. So as the derm story is similar in terms of destocking from prepriced buy-ins that we saw in the U.S. into retail in Q4 as well as a year ago, if you look at Japan, and if you look at our reporting last year in Q1, you would have seen a significant growth rate for Japan in the first quarter driven by those preprice buy-ups in Apoquel. And then you saw that go the other way in the second quarter. <br/>So if you were to, I would say, pro forma, the results for the first quarter, taking into account what I just said, you will see double-digit growth for the derm franchise in both the U.S. and international.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And we will take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.",
			"<strong>Ekaterina V. Knyazkova</strong>",
			"This is Ekaterina on for Chris. So first, on price increases, any feedback from the price increases in the beginning of the year? Are you seeing any pushback from veterinarians or pet owners? And any initial thoughts on how you'll be approaching price increases in 2024. And then the second question is on Diagnostics. Any thoughts on the proposed Mars, Heska acquisition and the impact that will have on the diagnostics market? Does it change Zoetis' plans in diagnostics or the investments you're making in that market.",
			"<strong>Kristin C. Peck</strong>",
			"Sure. Thanks, Ekaterina. I'll take your second question first and then let Wetteny take your first question on the pricing. I really think the margin -- acquisition of Heska confirms that the veterinary diagnostics market continues to be incredibly attractive investment area. Most importantly, it reinforces our strategy, we think, the sound around committees executed around in the U.S. specifically, building our reference lab network and continuing to invest in innovation importantly at our point of care. We had a robust start to 2023 as we look at our Imagyst, our virtual lab, our reference lab offering. We really believe it's resonating with customers. And really, our focus is on leading with cutting-edge medicine, really rolling out our virtual lab, which we really think is a differentiator. <br/>And we think that's what differentiates Zoetis overall, is innovation in the space, innovation around point of care, innovation in customer experience and innovation in the reference labs. So no, we really see that acquisition as reconfirming our strategy. And really, we're going to accelerate our growth focus on innovative diagnostics. So Wetteny do you want to take your second group of questions around pricing?",
			"<strong>Wetteny N. Joseph</strong>",
			"Yes, sure. Look, we have not seen any pressure in terms of end market demand, given our price increases. We took 5% price on the quarter, that's up versus 3% last year. If you look at the end market dynamics that we described earlier, you're seeing significant growth out from distributors to clinics, but also importantly, you're seeing significant growth from retail into pet owners. And we continue to see increased patient visits, for example, in derm, et cetera. So we have not seen any resistance there in terms of price increase.<br/>And by the way, if you look at international, we grew 10% in companion animal in the quarter given our price increases as well despite some preprice buy-in, which is normal in the fourth quarter. So we haven't seen any signs of that. If you look at livestock that actually offsets some of the -- marginally offset some of the price increases we would have seen in companion animal. We are going to see some impact on [Jackson], but not meaningful -- not at the level that we've seen previously as we previously said, and actually, we saw some volume offset to that positive -- positively offsetting some of the price on the Jackson side. So all told, in good shape in terms of what we're seeing in terms of market reaction to our prices. And in terms of what it means for 2024, too early, too early to tell. We won't go into that yet.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And we'll take our next question from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair.",
			"<strong>Brandon Vazquez</strong>",
			"The first one is just on guidance. You started off the year pretty strong despite kind of inventory levels, creating a little bit of noise here. But if you kind of read through that, you're looking at, I don't know, like high single digits, maybe even double-digit operational growth to start the year, reiterated guide for 6% to 8% operational growth. So the question being, basically, what would get you to that low end of that operational growth range, given the strength you're already seeing in the year if you kind of read through the noise?",
			"<strong>Wetteny N. Joseph</strong>",
			"So look, if you look at the end market dynamics that we see strength there. So I think that supports certainly, the mid- to high-end of our guidance, I would say. If you look at the -- what this means for the rest of the year, and I'll reiterate this point, which is we're already halfway through the second quarter, and again, we're seeing a strong start to the quarter, and we'll see that normalized growth rate, including mix, by the way, for the balance of the year.<br/>And keep in mind, right? Our guidance didn't change, including what we expect from livestock for the balance of the year. We went from saying less that could be minus 1% to plus 1%. We're saying it's flattish, basically the same thing. So how Q1 has played out is exactly as we thought, essentially, and therefore, the rest of the year is the same. And so no point in our guidance range is any, I would say, more power than the other. We feel great about where we are on the year, and how it's starting out for us in the second quarter, in particular, despite what you described as the noise in terms of the inventory levels.",

			"A couple of questions. First, the new manufacturing facility in Georgia, is the investment based predominantly on increased forecast for current products or positive late-stage R&amp;D progress for which we, at least on the outside, currently don't have visibility? Or is it some combination? And in the prepared remarks, you referred to disruptive novel innovation in the pipeline. Should we expect to get a window on that during the May meeting? And can you tell us if this is likely mainly directed at currently untreated diseases, more species, wider claims within existing species, improved dosing or something else?",
			"<strong>Kristin C. Peck</strong>",
			"Sure. The new manufacturing facility in -- right outside of Atlanta, Georgia will be both to support current products and the growth in our current products as well as we'll target launching some of our new monoclonal antibodies out of that facility as well. It's a very large facility. It gives us tons of flexibility which is what we found really exciting about the opportunity to be able to use it for lots of different things and really build a strong center in the south with a great labor market, really good access to workforce that we think makes a lot of sense. So we actually -- we see the facility's ability to do both, and that is currently the intention.<br/>As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we would expect it to be fully operational by 2026 and doing both at that point. With regards to Investor Day, we will be looking at the whole portfolio. We'll give you more details, which we've been asked for around the pain opportunity and what we're expecting there. We'll also talk about some of the new disease areas we've mentioned before. <br/>We'll give you a sense of what we think those markets could look like. A lot of those markets are new markets. So we'll help you size that market. We'll talk a lot about what our pipeline looks like and what we're doing now. So we'll give you information both on a species basis on -- importantly on sort of key technologies, as we talked about in monoclonal areas, monoclonal antibodies. And then also, lastly, talk about some of these emerging big new markets that we think we can attack with some of our new novel technologies.",

			"And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the program back to Kristin Peck for closing remarks.",
			"<strong>Kristin C. Peck</strong>",
			"Thank you. So look, just to summarize, we really see a very positive and sustainable demand for our products. based on what we've talked about for a long time, which is the fundamental drivers of animal health. We are confident that Zoetis has the industry's most diverse and durable global portfolio. And this is really founded on innovative science as we talk about and supported by a high-quality supply chain. We'll remain focused this year and going forward on our 5 key growth catalysts dermatology, parasiticides, pain, diagnostics and emerging markets. And we're going to continue to invest in the talent, the pipeline and the capabilities that support this future growth while ensuring that we can adapt to the dynamic environment that we all operate in. And we really look forward to sharing more about this with you our vision, our pipeline, our strategies for growth at our Investor Day on May 25. And there, you'll hear more from me, Wetteny, our Head of R&amp;D, Rob Polzer; about the confidence we have in the animal health industry, and importantly, our ability to grow faster than that market and the investments that we're making to create that value for our shareholders. <br/>So we announced the event this week, and I hope you can all join us virtually or at the New York Stock Exchange. As always, you can find more details about our Investor Relations information on our website. So thanks so much for joining us today.",

			"There’s been an upsurge of positive sentiment recently, as the 1Q23 earnings reports have been better than expected. Late last week, with 53% of the S&amp;P companies having reported, 79% had beaten the EPS estimates. This is a historically high number, above both the 5- and 10-year averages, and the aggregate beat, of 6.9%, is above the average beat of 6.4% over the past decade.",
			"Morgan Stanley’s chief investment officer Mike Wilson notes that this has investors expecting a ‘meaningful upward inflection in 2H ’23 EPS growth will come to fruition,’ but adds that such hopes are probably unwarranted, a result of hopes beating reality.",
			"Pointing out that a recession is looming in the second half of the year, Wilson, who has been noted for his bearish outlook in recent years, goes on to say, “Bottom line, stock selection and industry group selection becomes increasingly important late in the cycle. We continue to prefer traditional defensive sectors on a relative basis as well as single stocks with stable earnings profiles and high operational efficiency.”",
			"Putting that recommendation into action, the stock analysts at Morgan Stanley been looking for recession-resistant stocks, the type of equities that will provide portfolio protection in a difficult environment. We’ve opened up the <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:TipRanks database;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TipRanks database</a> and pulled up the details on two of their picks; here they are, along with the analyst commentaries.",
			"<strong>Intra-Cellular Therapies</strong> <strong>(<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:ITCI;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/itci/forecast\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ITCI</a>)</strong>",
			"We’ll start in the world of biotech, where Intra-Cellular Therapies has hit its sector’s jackpot – or found the Holy Grail, just choose your metaphor. To put short, Intra-Cellular has a medication on the market, approved by the FDA, with a patient base in a segment that is known for its high unmet medical needs. Intra-Cellular works in the field of neurologic and neuropsychiatric medicine, and is working on new treatments for schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, as well as Parkinson’s disease, opioid addiction, and agitation and psychosis due to Alzheimer’s.",
			"The company’s leading product, Caplyta, is now available on the commercial market by prescription. Caplyta is the brand name for lumateperone, which was approved in December 2019 for use in adults with schizophrenia. This patient population is known for its non-compliance with medication regimens. Caplyta has shown a lower level of interaction with off-target nervous receptors compared to established medications, making it less likely to cause adverse side effects and more likely to encourage patients to adhere to their physician’s instructions. This is an important feature for promoting commercialization.",
			"So far, commercialization has been proceeding apace. In the first quarter of 2023, the company reported Caplyta product revenues of $94.7 million, up 173% year-over-year. Total revenue in Q1 came to $95.31 million, beating the Street’s forecast by $2.9 million. Turning to the bottom line, the company saw a net loss per share, by non-GAAP measures, of 46 cents, which was 16 cents above expectations.",
			"The company is currently putting the drug through an additional set of clinical trials to evaluate it as a treatment for MDD and bipolar depression. Late in March, the company announced positive topline results from late-phase study (Study 403) of lumateperone as a monotherapy in this patient population.",
			"Intra-Cellular is not resting on its Caplyta successes. The company has an active pipeline program, with another three drug candidates in various stages of pre-clinical and clinical-stage studies.",
			"According to Morgan Stanley analyst Jeffrey Hung, who holds a 5-star rating from TipRanks, the near-term outlook for Caplyta is the primary catalyst for the stock’s performance.",
			"Looking at prescription numbers, he writes, “New patient starts are now 5-6x higher than prior to the label expansion, and the Caplyta prescriber base grew to 25,000+ unique prescribers by the end of 1Q (vs. ~22,000 unique prescribers reported in 4Q) with ~4,000 new first-time prescribers in 1Q, of which 1,400+ were in March alone. We are encouraged that Caplyta continues to demonstrate script and prescriber growth momentum, and we still believe that Caplyta sales will remain strong in 2023 with potential to exceed the company’s 2023 guidance.”",
			"Putting some numbers on the share potential, Hung rates the stock as Overweight (i.e. Buy) with an $80 price target that suggests a 29% one-year gain. (To watch Hung’s track record, <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:click here;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/jeffrey-hung\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>)",
			"Overall, there are 12 recent analyst reviews for this stock, and they include an 11 to 1 breakdown favoring the Buys over the Holds – for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock’s average price target is $74, implying 19% growth over the next year from the share price of $61.97.

			"For the second Morgan Stanley pick we’ll stick with the healthcare sector – but move over to a health insurance provider. While the Elevance name may not be immediately recognizable, the company was well-known under its previous moniker, Anthem. The company rebranded to Elevance in June of last year, but retained its customer base and market share.",
			"As Elevance now, the company boasts 48.1 million members, a total that reflects the 1.3 million new members added in 1Q23. Elevance, with its $110 billion market cap, is one of the largest health insurance providers in the US market, offering customers a range of services that includes insurance plans for medical, dental, disability, long-term care, behavioral health, and pharmaceutical services. The company works with Blue Cross Blue Shield, and is the largest managed health care company in the BC/BS network.",
			"The US healthcare sector is big business, making up more than 18% of the nation’s total GDP. Elevance capitalizes on that, to good results – the company saw $41.9 billion in revenue in its last reported quarter, 1Q23. That number marked a 10.6% year-over-year increase, and represented $960 million beat compared to analyst expectations. At the bottom line, Elevance reported a non-GAAP EPS figure of $9.46. This was 17 cents ahead of the forecast, and was 14.6% ahead of the year-ago number.",
			"Also in the first quarter, Elevance reported an operating cash flow of $6.5 billion. When early receipts of the April premium payments are stripped out, the company still shows $3.5 billion in cash flow, up $963 million y/y. The cash flow supported the dividend, which is currently set at $1.48 per share, or $5.92 annualized. At that rate, the payment yields a modest 1.3%. In Q1, Elevance paid out a total of $351 million in dividends.",
			"In February of this year, Elevance completed its acquisition of the pharmacy services company BioPlus. Details of the transaction were not disclosed – but BioPlus brings with it a range of services for patients dealing with serious, chronic condition, including MS, Hep C, autoimmune conditions, and cancer. BioPlus operates in all 50 states, and covers more than 100 medications of limited distribution.",
			"The completion of the BioPlus transaction is major win for Elevance, and forms the base for Morgan Stanley analyst Michael Ha’s portrait of the company.",
			"“We see strong long term earnings growth upside from fully scaling their specialty pharmacy, BioPlus. As we look beyond 2024, we believe Elevance is intentionally building specialty pharmacy (BioPlus) and claims adjudication (DomaniRx) capabilities to position themselves to fully in-source all of their drug spend to CarelonRx. Over time, as BioPlus fully scales… we estimate these drivers could add +110bps to +290bps of upside to Elevance’s long term earnings growth,” Ha opined.",
			"Ha goes on to rate Elevance stock an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and to set a price target of $571, indicating his belief that the stock will appreciate 25% over the next 12 months.

			"All in all, this stock has a unanimous Strong Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 14 positive reviews.

The type of consistency we crave in our dividends tends to be a cultural consistency and one that can be found throughout the years of various management at the firm. On the surface, we are looking for dividend stocks to buy. But in reality, we are looking for dividend aristocrats that can deliver across the board. That doesn’t mean simply paying out or raising a dividend. It also includes consistency with its business and the long-term returns generated for investors. Put simply, I want to own a business that can hold up to various fluctuations in the stock market, regardless of what’s going on. Let’s look at a few dividends for 2023.",

			"There’s one moment that really sticks with me and that was April 2020. The Covid-19 pandemic had exploded around the world and stocks were getting killed. It wasn’t odd to see the <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong> down 5%, 6%, 7%, or more — in a single session!",
			"Then <strong>Johnson &amp; Johnson</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:JNJ;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/jnj-stock-quote/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>JNJ</strong></a>) reported solid earnings, told a pretty reassuring tale, and raised its dividend. The stock jumped 4.5% the next day and the report kickstarted a 12.5% rally in the share price. What a way to reassure investors during a time of immense uncertainty. Fast-forward a few years and the firm recently <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:raised;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-dividend-increase-of-5-3#:~:text=New%20Brunswick%2C%20N.J.%20(April%2018,share%20to%20%241.19%20per%20share.\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">raised</a> its dividend for the 61st consecutive year. While it pays just a 2.9% dividend yield, it’s one of the most dependable yields in the market. Then consider J&amp;J’s other attributes and it becomes very difficult to ignore.",

			"For instance, shares trade at roughly 15 times this year’s earnings estimates, while analysts expect mid-single-digit earnings and revenue growth. That’s a rather low valuation and even if the growth rate isn’t robust, growth is growth and in a tough environment, that’s all we can ask for.",
			"Source: Shutterstock",
			"Want something with a little bit more growth? Try out <strong>PepsiCo</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:PEP;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/pep-stock-quote/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>PEP</strong></a>), a name every investor knows. This stock has quietly rallied to all-time highs and given the uncertain investing environment, it’s no surprise that investors are piling into names with predictable earnings and dependable cash flow.",
			"Think about it. PepsiCo not only dominates the beverage space with brands like Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Tropicana, OceanSpray, and others, but it also dominates snack brands too, owning Tostitos, Ruffles, Rold Gold, Lay’s, Cheetos, Doritos and <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:plenty of others;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.pepsico.com/our-brands/creating-smiles/our-products\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">plenty of others</a>. Put simply, PepsiCo dominates the food and beverages aisles at the grocery store. In good times and bad, there will be demand for its products — and so far, demand has remained pretty strong.",
			"The company <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:recently beat;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3959537-pepsico-non-gaap-eps-of-1_50-beats-0_11-revenue-of-17_85b-beats-580m\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recently beat</a> earnings and revenue expectations and gave a slight boost to its organic growth expectations.

While it yields “just” 2.65%, the firm has now raised its payout in 51 consecutive years. So regardless of what the stock market does, it’s clear that PepsiCo is one of the best dividend stocks out there.",
			"Source: Shutterstock",
			"A list of dividend stocks to buy in any environment could be pretty long. Perhaps the hardest was choosing between <strong>Procter &amp; Gamble</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:PG;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/pg-stock-quote/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>PG</strong></a>) and <strong>Realty Income</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:O;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/cryptocurrency/o/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>O</strong></a>). Ultimately I went with the latter, but there is a pretty big caveat to mention.",
			"This is not a stock for short-term investors. Further, Realty Income — or O stock for short — is one of the few stocks out there that hasn’t gone on to make new highs since the Covid-19 selloff. Conversely, P&amp;G has roared to 52-week highs in recent trading. Despite the rally, P&amp;G trades at roughly 26 times earnings with a nearly non-existent growth forecast for this year. That’s okay for some investors, as P&amp;G is a dividend stud. However, Realty Income shouldn’t be ignored either.",
			"Although there is the commercial real estate risk that could weigh on REITs — that being the “caveat” I mentioned a moment ago — Realty Income is really impressive when it comes to long-term investors buying, holding, and dripping the dividend. Shares yield just over 5%, the highest on this list, while the company pays its dividend monthly, not quarterly. Lastly, it has <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:raised;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.realtyincome.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">raised</a> its dividend in 102 consecutive quarters (or more than 25 years) and has paid its monthly dividend consecutively for more than 52 years!",

			"A holding company — usually a corporation or LLC — is created for the primary business of holding a controlling interest in the securities of other companies. Oftentimes known as parent companies, holding companies are quite common <a class=\"link yahoo-link\" data-ylk=\"slk:around the world;elm:context_link;itc:0;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-holding-companies-world-180637937.html\">around the world</a>, especially when it comes to large firms operating in lucrative industries such as finance and consumer goods.",
			"Somewhat similar to hedge funds, mutual funds, and investors in that they can hold an interest in certain firms, what sets holding companies apart is that they hold a controlling stake within a company that provides them with the ability to decide management and set long-term strategic goals for the target firm. This, in turn, allows a holding company to be entitled to the profits of its subsidiaries.",
			"There are certain advantages that come with a holding company, including liability protection. Since they are relatively easy to create or change, holding companies can take advantage of geographical differences in taxation regimes. If a location has high tax taxes, the holding company can simply relocate to a more business-friendly environment while continuing operations in the original area of operation.",
			"While the picture seems rosy for holding companies, the same isn't guaranteed for their subsidiaries. As an example, a subsidiary cannot raise capital by issuing new shares, and it is also at risk if the parent runs into legal troubles. Additionally, if a subsidiary company goes bankrupt, the holding company may experience a capital loss and a decline in net worth. That said, the bankrupt company’s creditors cannot legally pursue the holding company for remuneration.",

A company’s market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the share price by the number of shares outstanding. By that metric, all of the shares listed below qualify as large cap. Each stock listed below also pays out a dividend, providing shareholders with a dependable source of income. </span>",
			"<span>May is a great month to buy these companies despite the old adage to “sell in May and go away.” There may be a historical precedent for weaker performance during the summer, but investors in these dividend-paying large-cap stocks generate passive income year round. Investors who choose to direct their capital into the safety of large-cap <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:dividend stocks;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/stock-types/dividend-stocks/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dividend stocks</a> should consider doing so right now, at least in these names. </span>",

It is indeed among the group of large-cap stocks, boasting a market cap north of $250 billion. Broadcom designs, develops, and sells its software well. This is reflected in the company’s strong fundamentals and valuation metrics, which I think make it a company worthy of investment. </span>",
			"<span>Although it is currently earnings season, Broadcom actually released its <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:results;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-inc-announces-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2023-financial\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">results</a> two months ago. Earnings were strong, and the market reacted in kind, sending share prices from $598 to around $630 overnight. That would have been a better time to establish a position, but now is as good a time as any. That’s partly because the company’s share price has since sunk back down toward the $610 level, significantly below the average analyst target price above <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:$700;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AVGO/research-ratings\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$700</a>. </span>",
			"<span>In short, Broadcom grew its revenue 16% on a year-over-year basis. This enabled the company to repurchase shares and provide a decent outlook for 8% growth in Q2.  </span>",
			"<span>Broadcom is still working to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:acquire VMWare,;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.networkworld.com/article/3688515/broadcom-vmware-extend-deadline-to-complete-acquisition-by-90-days.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">acquire VMWare,</a> which is likely to spike its stock price closer to that $700 level if it goes through. </span>",

			"<span>There’s good reason to believe</span><b> Raytheon</b><span> (NYSE:<span><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:RTX;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/rtx-stock-quote/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>RTX</strong></a></span>) stock could move $10 higher toward its target price in the coming months. The defense company released Q1 results on April 25 which showed investors a strong, predictable firm with good prospects. </span>",
			"<span>Raytheon <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:reported;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investors.rtx.com/static-files/f391dc2f-926a-4d71-a85a-3630a59e89b1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> 10% overall sales growth along with 10% organic growth. So, why should RTX stock be expected to grow now? I think the answer to that question relates to a few key factors. For one, demand for its products and services is high. The company has a record $180 billion backlog and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.25. Book-to-bill is a comparison of booked orders relative to those that have been processed and are ready to bill.  </span>",
			"<span>Those figures seem to vindicate the general idea that defense spending is trending upward as geopoltical tensions rise. Raytheon reduced its dividend in 2021, but has since increased it <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:twice;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/RTX/dividend\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">twice</a>.

Currently, LIN stock yields 1.4%, and was last reduced in <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:1996;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/LIN/dividend\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1996</a>.

Although sales were flat at $8.2 billion and up only 3% year-over-year, the period was strong overall. Operating profit increased by over 16%, reaching $2 billion. However, earnings per share was where Linde really shined. The company delivered earnings per share of $3.42, well beyond the highest end of the analyst range. In fact, it was the fourth straight quarter in which Linde’s EPS exceeded analysts’ predictions. </span>",
			"<span>Linde’s continued strong earnings performance suggests that it has strong upside potential over the long-term. </span>",

			"<span>Now is the time to invest in</span><b> AbbVie</b><span> (NYSE:<span><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:ABBV;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/abbv-stock-quote/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>ABBV</strong></a></span>), even as Humira sales decline sharply. The blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug accounted for $5.587 billion of AbbVie’s $12.23 billion in sales during <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Q1;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investors.abbvie.com/news-releases/news-release-details/abbvie-reports-first-quarter-2023-financial-results\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Q1</a>. However, sales also declined sharply for the drug, falling 25.2% year-over-year.</span>",
			"<span>That led to an overall sales decline at AbbVie of 9.7%. None of this sounds particularly positive. AbbVie relies on Humira, which is losing patent protection for a large portion of its business. A predictable decline is occurring as expected. </span>",
			"<span>But there’s a caveat here. AbbVie’s sales were slightly above those expected on <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Wall Street;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/abbvie-stock-earnings-humira-sales-drop-10b6875e?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D24867010846680895882203808307966566715%7CMCORGID%3DCB68E4BA55144CAA0A4C98A5%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1682715250\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Street</a>. The earnings beat, though small, suggests AbbVie is strategically doing what it should be, in promoting the other parts of its portfolio and pushing for greater sales and market share.  </span>",
			"<span>AbbVie didn’t do worse than expected, but investors simply didn’t care to see Humira sales soften, although everyone knew they would. The markets were being irrational when they dinged ABBV stock for these results, meaning there’s an opportunity for keen investors. </span>",

Let me explain. </span>",
			"<span>Hershey currently expects sales to decline by 8% in 2023 after releasing Q1 <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:earnings;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.thehersheycompany.com/content/hershey-corporate/en-us/home/newsroom/press-release/press-release-detail.html?122737\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">earnings</a> on April 27. Additionally, the company expects its earnings per share to shrink by 15%. This is a case of seemingly bad news being good news. </span>",
			"<span>An 8% decline in 2023 sales is an upward adjustment to the high end of Hershey’s previous range. That is also true for its earnings per share figures. Indeed, this appears to all be a result of strong consumer demand that resulted in a revenue increase of 12.1% (12.2% organic) in Q1, with overall revenue reaching $2.898 billion. Net income also came in at $587.2 million, up 10.9%. </span>",
			"<span>These strong results are attributable to the fact that consumers remain willing to pay more for everyday items. That truth has been evident across the market as earnings continue to come in and companies continue to report the same idea that consumers are still willing to absorb higher prices. </span>",
			"Source: Alexander Yakimov / Shutterstock.com",
			"<b>Mastercard</b><span> (NYSE:<span><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:MA;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/ma-stock-quote/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>MA</strong></a></span>) is a dividend-paying stock to consider buying right now. Notably, MA stock pays a very modest 57 cent dividend that yields 0.6%. Admittedly, that isn’t a particularly compelling reason to buy. Investors don’t really buy this stock for its dividend – it’s the company’s growth profile that continues to shine. </span>",
			"<span>Indeed, </span><span>Mastercard is a smart choice right now for a different set of reasons. Consumer spending remains very strong for one. Mastercard notes as much in its earnings <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:report;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://s25.q4cdn.com/479285134/files/doc_financials/2023/q1/1Q23-Mastercard-Earnings-Release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">report</a>. Management also notes that cross-border travel continues to strengthen given the company further tailwinds. </span>",
			"<span>But at the same time, that’s all a positive spin on a bitter truth. American credit card debt is spiraling out of control. It reached <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:$986 billion;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.lendingtree.com/credit-cards/credit-card-debt-statistics/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$986 billion</a> in total in Q4, up by $61 billion in Q3. American consumer spending benefits Mastercard tremendously as balances rise. The bill is going to come due, and Mastercard will likely be one of the primary beneficiaries.</span>",

			"<span>The insurance and healthcare provider’s better-than-expected first quarter results reaffirm that idea. The company’s earnings per share of $6.26 beat expectations by 10 cents. Likewise, the company’s medical loss ratio, at 82.2%, came in lower than expected. That means the company paid fewer medical care premiums overall, in turn contributing to stronger earnings per share figures. </span>",
			"<span>UnitedHealth Group’s dividend is rock-solid, yet modest. Currently, UNH stock yields only 1.35%, but was last reduced in 1990. Let’s run some hypothetical math here to understand the real beauty of UNH stock as an investment. Shares currently trade for $492 but have a<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:target price;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/UNH/research-ratings\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> target price</a> of $596. Assuming dividends remain the same for the next year an investor could reasonably expect their $492 to be worth $602.60 if analysts are correct ($596 + 1.65(4)). That equates to a 22.47% return. That’s an excellent return over a 12 to 18 month period. </span>",

Kenvue’s $3.8 billion IPO was the biggest in New York since Rivian Automotive Inc. in November 2021 due to five quarters of volatility and interest-rate uncertainty that stalled most deals in the pipeline.",

			"“We are extremely well positioned, as Kenvue, to start a new chapter as a publicly trade company. We have a great portfolio,” Chief Executive Officer Thibaut Mongon said during an interview. He said the company would consider acquisitions, but is looking to its current products and brands for growth.",

While there’s been concern about consumers pulling back spending in the US, the latest earnings reports from peers including Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Kimberly-Clark Corp. show that Americans are still willing to pay higher prices for household essentials.",

			"What Bloomberg Intelligence Says",
			"“Johnson &amp; Johnson’s spinoff of its consumer health brand segment, Kenvue, will likely be good for the health-care giant, but it’s unclear if it will be good for the stand-alone Kenvue.

			"Kenvue CEO Thibaut Mongon joins Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange to discuss the IPO of the Johnson &amp; Johnson spinoff and the company's outlook in the personal pharmaceutical space.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">AKIKO FUJITA:</span> Well, Johnson &amp; Johnson's consumer health spin-off, Kenvue, is officially going public on the New York Stock Exchange today. Kenvue will now be the company behind brands like Tylenol, Band-Aid, and Listerine. Trading under the ticker, KVUE, shares were priced at $22 a share. And now you're seeing it up about 20% almost here on its initial day.",
			"It is the biggest IPO in more than a year and we've got Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with Kenvue's CEO. Anjalee.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">ANJALEE KHEMLANI:</span> That's right, Akiko. I have here with me Thibaut Mongon, who used to head J&amp;J's consumer segment and is now sliding into the CEO position of Kenvue. Thibaut, thank you so much for joining us today. Obviously, a really lovely start for you for the stock. More than you expected, I imagine?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">THIBAUT MONGON:</span> No. Thank you for having me. We are very excited. Today is a great day. We just listed Kenvue view for the first time, bringing it to life as the world's largest pure-play consumer health company. $15 billion in revenue, presence in 165 countries. So today millions of consumers have in their house Kenvue brand.",
			"Think about Tylenol, Neutrogena, Band-Aid, Listerine, Aveeno. These are brands that have been with consumers for decades and sometimes for generations. And we are happy to bring Kenvue to the world today and make sure that we are excited about today, but also what lies ahead.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">ANJALEE KHEMLANI:</span> Absolutely. To your point, brands that people know very well. The company already valued close to $50 billion based on the IPO right now, largest this year. Really good start for the brand, but talk to me about separating from that legacy J&amp;J brand, which is what these consumers know, and about how Kenvue now fits in this new consumer health market.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">THIBAUT MONGON:</span> Yeah, we do this from a position of strength. Kenvue have strong leadership positions across the different categories where we play. We are the only company our size covering all aspects of consumer health, self-care, skin health, essential health. But with the depth and expertise that we have because we have been in this space for 135 years. So that's what really makes Kenvue unique and that's what makes us very confident in our ability to thrive as a publicly traded company.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">ANJALEE KHEMLANI:</span> How does it fit into the broader market? We know that GSK, for example, spun-off Haleon. And so there's examples of this, and they've been performing pretty strongly as well quarter-over-quarter. How do you think about investment, innovation, and the like when it comes to Kenvue moving forward?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">THIBAUT MONGON:</span> Yeah, we are very pleased with the portfolio we have. We are very well positioned in the categories where we play, but also the unique portfolio of iconic brands we have at Kenvue, and we see ample opportunity for our brands to continue to grow, to continue to innovate, so we can bring to consumers a product and solution they need to take better health-- better care of their health. And that's really our mission at Kenvue.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">ANJALEE KHEMLANI:</span> Almost like you're separating from the company. You're like a 16-year-old being given the keys to the car and you get to just take off, right?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">THIBAUT MONGON:</span> Yeah, a 135-year-old 16-year-old. Yes, we are going to be more focused with more agility. Really being able to focus on our mission to be close to our consumers and understand how we can innovate to better serve their needs.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">ANJALEE KHEMLANI:</span> And I know this is just a starting off point. You obviously have build out. J&amp;J still holding a majority stake in the company for the rest of the year. You're also building out a new space, a new headquarters. But in terms of looking at old J&amp;J, there's also the talc situation, the litigation there.",
			"You have the product coming under this new consumer brand, but you are indemnified against the case. Talk to me about the baby powder and baby products moving forward and the plans for them.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">THIBAUT MONGON:</span> Yeah. Let me be very clear. The liability in the US and Canada stays with J&amp;J. So at Kenvue we are laser-focused on what we do best, building brands that have strong trust and leadership position with consumers. That's why we are focused on right now and we continue to evolve our portfolio to more natural, sustainable solutions. And that's what we will continue doing moving forward.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">ANJALEE KHEMLANI:</span> Tell me about the read on the market for consumers. What is it that you think they're looking for when it comes to the outlook of the brand development of what types of products you're looking to introduce. Anything new on the horizon?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">THIBAUT MONGON:</span> Yeah. There is no limit for you to take care of your own health and there is no limit for Kenvue to invent products and solutions that allow you to do that. So it is summer is coming. So if you take sunscreen, as an example, unfortunately, millions of Americans do not use sunscreen on a regular basis today.",
			"So that's something that we look at at Kenvue. Our Neutrogena teams did step up and launch innovation with a new product. Neutrogena Invisible Defense that doesn't leave any residue on your skin, whatever your skin tone. And so that's going to be a great new reason for Americans to reconsider sunscreen and have a great summer thanks to Neutrogena.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">ANJALEE KHEMLANI:</span> I may or may not be one of those people that skips out on sunscreen sometimes. OK. So final question for you. Going forward, you taking over at the helm of the company, is this a long-term takeover for you? Do you imagine you're going to be with the company for quite some time? Because you've already been with legacy J&amp;J.",
			"You've overseen the growth of the consumer business through the pandemic and everything. How do you feel about going forward?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">THIBAUT MONGON:</span> Well, very excited today, but also about the future what lies ahead for me, but also for the 22,000 team members who around the world work every single day to make sure that they help consumers realize the extraordinary power of everyday care. That brings them products and solutions that are grounded in science.",
			"And those by doctors, health care professionals helping them take better care of their health. That's what we are focused on in Kenvue and we are very excited about it.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">ANJALEE KHEMLANI:</span> Love it. Well, Thibaut Mongon, new CEO of Kenvue. Congratulations on the IPO today. Seana, back to you.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">SEANA SMITH:</span> Great stuff, Anjalee. Great interview. Thanks so much. Kenvue shares up 20% today in their public debut."

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including McDonald's Corporation (MCD), Deere &amp; Company (DE) and Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. (MMC). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.<br/><br/>You can <strong>see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong><br/><br/>Shares of<strong> McDonald's</strong> have performed in-line with the Zacks Restaurants Industry in the year-to-date period (+12% vs. +12.5%), but have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index (+7.1%)</span><span>. The company’s top and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis in the March-quarter report on April 25th. The upside was fueled by strong comps performance, digital initiatives, marketing campaigns and loyalty programs.</span>",
			"<br/><span>McDonald’s is increasing its focus on menu innovation, as it believes that the strengthening of the core menu and solid marketing are likely to pave the way for additional growth in the upcoming periods.<br/><br/>The company is also undertaking efforts to drive growth in international markets. Robust digitalization is likely to help the company support long-term growth. Earnings estimates for 2023 have increased in the past 30 days.<br/><br/>(You can <strong>read the full research report on McDonald’s here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br/><br/><strong>Deere</strong> shares have outperformed the Zacks Manufacturing - Farm Equipment industry over the past year (+1.0% vs. +0.2%). The company is witnessing solid growth in order levels, which is expected to aid its top-line performance in the forthcoming quarters. Strong replacement demand will also continue to boost the company's results.<br/><br/>Demand for its construction equipment will likely benefit from anticipated growth in infrastructure investments in the United States. Improved prices will help negate the impact of high material and labor costs on the company's margins. The earnings estimates for the company for the ongoing quarter and fiscal year have undergone positive revisions lately.<br/><br/>Product launches equipped with the latest technology to make farming automated will continue to provide Deere with an edge over its competitors. The company is poised to benefit in the long run from rapid growth in global population as well as the rising worldwide infrastructure needs.<br/><br/>(You can <strong>read the full research report on Deere here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br/><br/>Shares of <strong>Marsh &amp; McLennan</strong> have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry over the past six months (+10.7% vs. +7.7%). The company is well-poised to grow on the back of acquisitions made within its operating units, the launch of new products and branching out into new businesses. Its increased stake in Marsh India will further buoy growth.<br/><br/>Revenues have been increasing thanks to a wide geographic presence and strong client retention. The Zacks analyst expects the top line to grow 4.6% year over year in 2023. The Risk and Insurance Services unit has been contributing to revenue growth for a while. MMC had around $4 billion left under authorization as of Mar 31, 2023.<br/><br/>However, high operating costs might weigh on the margins. A debt-laden balance sheet is a concern. Its valuation remains stretched at the current level. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.<br/><br/>(You can <strong>read the full research report on Marsh &amp; McLennan here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br/><br/>Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX), Uber Technologies, Inc.

			"<strong>Moderna </strong>MRNA reported earnings of 19 cents per share for the first quarter of 2023, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate of a loss of $1.77 and $2.09, respectively. Earnings declined 98% in the quarter. The year-over-year decline in the bottom line was due to lower revenues and higher operating expenses incurred during the first quarter.",
			"Revenues in the quarter were $1.86 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate of $1.16 billion and $1.05 billion, respectively. Total revenues declined 69% year over year due to lower COVID-19 vaccine sales during the quarter.",
			"Moderna’s shares were up 2.3% in pre-market trading on May 4, likely due to the better-than-expected earnings reported by the company. Investors were expecting the company to report a loss in the first quarter. However, the company’s positive earnings in the quarter took the investor community by surprise. The better-than-expected earnings performance was driven by higher-than expected revenues generated by the company from its COVID-19 vaccine product sales.",
			"In the year so far, the stock has declined 27.6% compared with the industry’s 6.2% fall.",
			"<br/>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research",
			"Product sales, entirely from the sale of COVID-19 vaccines, were down 69% year over year to $1.83 billion due to lower sales volume compared with the year-ago period’s levels. Per management, the figure represents majority of the deferred 2022 revenues worth $2.0 billion, expected in first-half 2023.",
			"Grant and collaboration revenues were $34 million compared with $141 million in the year-ago quarter. The company earns collaboration revenues from agreements with several big pharma/biotech companies, including <strong>Merck</strong> MRK and Vertex Pharmaceuticals.",
			"Selling, general and administrative expenses were $305 million, up 14% year over year. The upside can be attributed to increased spending in commercialization activities to support the company’s marketed products and expansion.",
			"Research &amp; development expenses were $1.1 billion, up 104% from the year-ago period’s levels. The significant increase was primarily attributable to higher clinical costs and personnel-related expenses.",
			"Moderna reiterated its product revenue guidance for 2023. Management expects to record a minimum of around $5.0 billion from COVID vaccine sales in 2023, based on confirmed advance purchase agreements and contract deferrals. Management also reported that this figure does not include product sales in the United States or new contracts with Europe, Japan and other key markets. The company expects to record approximately $2.0 billion in product sales in first-half 2023, indicating product revenues in second-quarter 2023 between $0.2-$0.3 billion.",
			"The company maintained combined R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses to be approximately $6.0 billion in 2023, with nearly $4.5 billion in R&amp;D. It expects capital expenditures to be around $1.0 billion.",
			"Moderna has 48 mRNA-based investigational candidates with 36 candidates in clinical development stage. The company has three late-stage candidates — mRNA-1647, mRNA-1345 and mRNA-1010 — in its pipeline, which are being developed as cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine and influenza vaccine, respectively.",
			"Management is on track to file a regulatory application with the FDA seeking approval for its RSV vaccine candidate, mRNA-1345, before the end of second-quarter 2023. The company also reported that it has completed more than 50% of the enrolment in the pivotal phase III study, evaluating its CMV vaccine candidate mRNA-1647.",
			"Since the onset of 2023, Moderna faced two major setbacks in late-stage clinical studies evaluating its influenza vaccine mRNA-1010. This February, Moderna announced mixed results from a late-stage study (P301), evaluating mRNA-1010 conducted in the Southern Hemisphere. While the vaccine showed promise against the influenza A virus, it did not show any improvement against the influenza B virus. Last month, management provided the first interim analysis from a phase III efficacy study (P302) evaluating mRNA-1010 conducted in the Northern Hemisphere. The P302 study failed to meet the statistical threshold needed to declare early success.",
			"Based on these analyses of data, management announced that it initiated a phase III immunogenicity study (P303) to test an updated formulation of mRNA-1010, which is expected to improved immune responses against influenza B strain. The P303 study will also allow the company to seek accelerated approval for the vaccine.",
			"Last month, Moderna and Merck announced detailed results from the phase IIb KEYNOTE-942 study, evaluating their personalized cancer vaccine (PCV) candidate mRNA-4157 in melanoma patients. The companies revealed that after a follow-up period of around two years, 22.4% of patients treated with mRNA-4157 plus Merck’s blockbuster drug Keytruda reported disease recurrence/death compared with 40% in the control arm. Moderna and Merck are currently discussing these results with regulatory authorities. The companies intend to start a phase III study in melanoma patients later this year and also intend to expand the PCV vaccine to other cancer indications, including non-small cell lung cancer.",

			"(Adds reference to Novo earnings in paragraph 3)",
			"By Michael Erman",
			"NEW YORK, May 4 (Reuters) - The enormous demand for weight-loss treatments like Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy could support as many as 10 competing products with annual sales reaching up to $100 billion within a decade, mostly in the United States, industry executives and analysts said.",
			"More than half a dozen companies, from Pfizer Inc and Amgen Inc to smaller players like Altimmune Inc , are working on weight-loss therapies similar to Wegovy, viewing them as important future growth drivers.",
			"Novo was first to introduce an effective treatment shown to help people lose up to 15% of their weight. The company on Thursday reported better-than-expected profits fueled by demand for Wegovy, and told Reuters that it would prioritize U.S. supplies of the weight-loss drug over launching in new markets.",
			"Eli Lilly and Co is expected to receive a U.S. weight loss approval for its similar drug, Mounjaro, later this year.",
			"Both treatments are given by weekly injection and belong to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 agonists originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes. In addition to controlling blood sugar, they affect hunger signals to the brain and slow the rate at which a person's stomach empties, making them feel full longer.",
			"Would-be rivals see room for treatments that are more convenient or provide additional health benefits. Even a small share of the market could be worth billions.",
			"\"We're going full guns on this,\" said Bill Sessa, chief scientific officer at Pfizer's Internal Medicine Research Unit. \"If we can accelerate, we will.\"",
			"The company has two oral GLP-1 drugs in mid-stage trials, and aims to choose one for a late-stage trial this year. An obesity therapy \"is going to be one of the main drugs for Pfizer moving forward,\" Sessa said.",
			"Over 650 million adults worldwide are obese, more than triple the rate in 1975, and roughly another 1.3 billion are overweight, exacerbating conditions such as heart disease and diabetes, according to the World Health Organization.",
			"The United States is expected to account for as much as 90% of weight-loss drug sales due to the number of potential patients and higher pricing than other countries, industry analysts and executives say.",
			"\"We're seeing a sea change in how we treat metabolic conditions,\" said BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman. He forecasts GLP-1s or similar drugs topping $100 billion in annual sales early in the 2030s, with Lilly's product accounting for more than $50 billion in sales.",
			"Morningstar analyst Damien Conover believes the weight loss market will be similar to lucrative categories like cholesterol-lowering statins and blood pressure drugs \"where the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth to market were blockbuster drugs,\" with annual sales topping $1 billion.",
			"UNMET NEED",
			"Pfizer believes an oral therapy will appeal to people who want to avoid injections. The company plans to enroll some patients in its late-stage trial who have already used Wegovy or Mounjaro to show they can effectively switch to the Pfizer alternative.",
			"Eli Lilly is working on an oral GLP-1. Novo Nordisk already offers Rybelsus, an oral version of the same compound (semaglutide) in Wegovy for diabetes, although its success has been limited.",
			"\"More treatment options to help improve the lives of those living with obesity are good advancements for patients and a testament to the significant unmet need of addressing obesity,\" a Novo spokesperson said. Dr. Jamie Kane, chief of obesity medicine at New York's Northwell Health, called the new weight-loss drugs \"very promising.\"",
			"\"And you never know who will respond better to one versus the other, so having a variety of similar but not identical products will probably be helpful,\" Kane said.",
			"Doctors expect patients will need to stay on these drugs long term to maintain their weight loss. Last year, a Novo Nordisk-funded study found patients regained about two-thirds of their lost weight a year after stopping treatment.",
			"Smaller biotechs are also vying for a piece of the obesity market and hope large pharmaceutical companies will pay up for partnerships.",
			"\"There's interest from multiple parties who want to play in the space,\" said Altimmune Chief Executive Vipin Garg.",
			"The company's pemviditude, which targets GLP-1 as well as another hormone called glucagon, is in Phase 2, or mid-stage, trials. Garg says the combination could help reduce liver fat that contributes to a condition called NASH, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, another large unmet need.",
			"\"I don't know if it's $90 billion or $80 billion or $50 billion. Does that really matter in the end?\" he said. \"Even just 10% of that market size is a very significant slice of the pie.\"",
			"Germany's Boehringer Ingelheim is testing a similar dual-action therapy developed with Danish biotech Zealand Pharma .",
			"OPKO Health has completed a Phase 2 trial of its obesity drug that it expects will have fewer side effects. The current GLP-1 drugs can cause nausea and vomiting.",
			"China's LeaderMed has agreed to develop and sell OPKO's compound there. OPKO is also in talks with larger Western drugmakers for a partnership.",
			"\"This is not a market that you can ignore,\" said OPKO president Elias Zerhouni, Sanofi's former research chief. \"It's going to be a 5 to 10 company market.\"",

Some dividend ETFs may focus on a particular sector, such as utilities or consumer staples, while others may have a more broad-based approach and invest in stocks across multiple sectors.",
			"The consistent changes in monetary policies last year presented a challenging environment for investors because the Fed struggled to tame inflation. This scenario opened new investment ideas for investors as they searched to generate additional income. Dividend ETFs provided a way out for investors because they offered regular income, long-term growth potential, diversification, and lower volatility than non-dividend stocks. <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Morningstar;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1131236/a-brutal-year-in-the-markets-doesnt-rattle-etf-investors\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Morningstar</a> reported that dividend-centric ETFs raked in $69.7 billion in net inflows in 2022, $51.6 billion of which was directed into the large-value category.

			"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.",
			"While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.",
			"<b>Cigna in Focus</b>",
			"Cigna (CI) is headquartered in Bloomfield, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of -25.76% since the start of the year. The health insurer is currently shelling out a dividend of $1.23 per share, with a dividend yield of 2%. This compares to the Insurance - Multi line industry's yield of 2.27% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.76%.",
			"In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $4.92 is up 9.8% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Cigna has increased its dividend 3 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 306.36%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Cigna's current payout ratio is 19%. This means it paid out 19% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.",
			"Looking at this fiscal year, CI expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $24.78 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 6.49%.",
			"<b>Bottom Line</b>",
			"Investors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.",
			"For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, CI is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).",

			"As the banking turmoil continues, bank investors are in a lot of pain. Investors are selling first and asking questions later. Given the volatility in banks, seeking safety in the best undervalued blue-chip stocks within the sector is advisable.",
			"Due to the indiscriminate selling, strong banking franchises like <strong>Wells Fargo</strong> (NYSE:<span><strong><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:WFC;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/wfc-stock-quote/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WFC</a></strong></span>) are emerging as value plays. Unlike regional banks facing questions about funding costs, the bank is in pristine shape. It is the fourth-largest bank in the U.S., with a nationwide branch presence. This strong retail franchise enables it to have one of the lowest deposit costs in the industry.",
			"The bank had a challenging decade from its <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:cross-selling scandal;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/19/heres-what-the-wells-fargo-cross-selling-scandal-means-for-the-bank.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cross-selling scandal</a> and the ensuing regulatory scrutiny. Today, these legacy problems are still an overhang on the stock, particularly the $1.95 trillion asset cap by the Federal Reserve.

For instance, in December 2022, it settled with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for $3.7 billion.",
			"Since the asset cap restriction, Wells Fargo has focused on improving its efficiency and streamlining its operations. These initiatives have led to an improved operating ratio. Analysts hope the Fed will eventually lift its asset cap as Wells Fargo works through the remaining consent orders. A quick look at analyst research on the stock reflects this. The current <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:consensus rating;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/wfc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">consensus rating</a> is a strong buy, with an average price target representing a 20% upside.",
			"And the bullish analyst view is also backed by a cheap valuation. Wells Fargo is trading at a relatively low price-to-book (P/B). At the end of 1Q 2023, the book and tangible book value per share were $43.02 and $35.87, respectively. Finally, besides the low P/B, the bank has an attractive 3% yield.",

One of the company’s key strengths is its diversified portfolio of assets. Its operations span upstream and downstream operations, chemicals and lubricants. This portfolio mix helps to mitigate oil and gas volatility risks and provides a source of stable earnings.",
			"After a challenging pandemic period, when oil crashed to below zero, business is booming. In the past two years, the company has benefited from higher oil prices. However, the company isn’t relying on commodity inflation alone for revenue growth.",

Exxon has been a dividend grower, raising its annual dividend for 39 consecutive years. Management expects to increase shareholder distributions through dividends and buybacks.",

			"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $3.05, expectations were $3.",
			"<strong>Operator:</strong> Good day, and welcome to the Vertex Pharmaceuticals First Quarter 2023 Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Susie Lisa. Please go ahead.",
			"<strong>Susie Lisa:</strong> Good evening, all. My name is Susie Lisa, and as the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, it is my pleasure to welcome you to our first quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. On tonight's call making prepared remarks, we have Dr. Reshma Kewalramani, Vertex's CEO and President; Stuart Arbuckle, Chief Operating Officer; and Charlie Wagner, Chief Financial Officer. We recommend that you access the webcast slides as you listen to this call. The call is being recorded and a replay will be available on our website. We will make forward-looking statements on this call that are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in today's press release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
			"These statements, including without limitation, those regarding Vertex's marketed cystic fibrosis medicines, our pipeline and Vertex's future financial performance are based on management's current assumptions. Actual outcomes and events could differ materially. I would also note that select financial results and guidance that we will review on the call this evening are presented on a non-GAAP basis. In addition, the impact of foreign exchange is presented inclusive of our foreign exchange risk management program. I will now turn the call over to Reshma.",
			"<strong>Reshma Kewalramani:</strong> Thanks, Susie. Good evening, all, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We're pleased to have opened with a strong start to 2023, as first quarter global CF product revenues grew 13% versus the first quarter of 2022. In addition, we completed the Exa-cel U.S. rolling BLA submissions for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia and secured U.S. approval for TRIKAFTA in patients two years to five years of age. Now is an especially exciting time at Vertex because within our five launches in five years, or five in five goal, we see multiple programs with near-term launch potential including exa-cel and sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia, the vanzacaftor triple in CF, and VX-548 for acute pain.",
			"In total, we now have programs in eight disease areas, in mid and late-stage development, six of which are past the proof-of-concept stage as depicted on slide five. With this breadth of compelling opportunities, we're investing accordingly to drive continued pipeline success, clinical trial progress, and the buildout of commercialization capabilities. In addition, beyond the eight disease areas already in the clinic, the next wave of innovation is advancing through preclinical development, including programs in Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, Myotonic dystrophy type 1, NAV1.7 for pain, and gentler conditioning agents for use with exa-cel. With a uniquely strong and durable CF franchise, multiple near-term commercial opportunities, a broad and rapidly advancing pipeline, a strong balance sheet, and an exceptionally talented and committed team, Vertex has never been as well-positioned to deliver for patients and shareholders for years to come.",
			"With that overview, I'll turn to the details of recent R&amp;D progress starting with CF. Our next in-class vanzacaftor triple combination has completed enrollment in its two Phase 3 clinical trials in patients ages 12 years and above, known as SKYLINE 102 and SKYLINE 103 and is progressing well. Enrollment in patients ages six to 11 known as the RIDGELINE study is also advancing rapidly. We continue to anticipate the completion of the SKYLINE studies by the end of this year, and I'm pleased to share, we now project the completion of the RIDGELINE study at approximately the same time as the SKYLINE studies. Recognizing the very high bar set by TRIKAFTA, we have high expectations for the vanzacaftor triple program based on the totality of the evidence generated to-date, and as was recently reported in Lancet Respiratory Medicine.",
			"Preclinically, our HBE assays which have consistently proven to have robust translation from the bench into the clinic showed greater restoration of chloride transport with the vanzacaftor triple than with TRIKAFTA. In the Phase 2 clinical program, the vanzacaftor triple drove greater CFTR function and correspondingly lower levels of sweat chloride that has been seen with TRIKAFTA. As such, we believe the vanzacaftor triple has the potential for enhanced clinical benefit along with the convenience of once-daily dosing. In addition, we expect the vanza triple to carry substantially lower royalty burden. Another important study in our CF portfolio pertains to VX-522, our CFTR mRNA therapy that we're developing in partnership with Moderna for the more than 5,000 CF patients who cannot benefit from CFTR modulators.",
			"We have initiated the single ascending dose or SAD study of VX-522 and are actively enrolling and dosing CF patients. We anticipate completing the SAD portion of the study and initiating the multiple ascending dose portion of the study this year. Turning now to exa-cel, our gene editing program for severe sickle cell disease and transfusion dependent beta thalassemia. exa-cel holds the potential to be the first CRISPR-based gene editing treatment to be approved, as well as the promise to be a one-time functional cure for these diseases. This is our most advanced program outside of CF and we expect exa-cel to be our next commercial launch. Per our prior guidance, we completed our BLA submissions for both sickle cell disease and TDT in the U.S. at the end of last quarter.",
			"We now await acceptance of our filings and assignment of the PDUFA date. Our filings include requests for Priority Review, which if granted will result in an eight months review by FDA from the time of submission. Internationally, as previously announced, both the EMA and MHRA have validated our exa-cel MAA submissions, and those filings are under review. We see a significant opportunity for exa-cel. Stuart will comment further on the market opportunity and our launch preparations in just a few minutes. Turning next to our pain program and VX-548, our novel highly selective NaV1.8 inhibitor that holds the promise of effective pain relief without the side effects or addictive properties of opioids. We have confidence in the outlook for this program, given, one, NaV1.8 is a genetically and pharmacologically validated target.",
			"Two, we have multiple positive proof-of-concept results with our predecessor NaV1.8 inhibitor VX-150 across acute, neuropathic, and musculoskeletal pain, and with VX-548 itself in acute pain. And three, our Phase 3 program with VX-548 in acute pain is substantially similar to the positive Phase 2 II trials we have already concluded. VX-548 has been granted Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations for acute pain in the U.S. We initiated pivotal development last year and enrollment and dosing across the three Phase 3 studies continue to progress nicely. These studies have been designed to support our goal of a broad moderate-to-severe acute pain label that would enable prescribing and usage across multiple care settings, including at the site of care post discharge and in the home.",
			"We continue to anticipate completing the acute pain Phase 3 pivotal program towards the end of this year or beginning of next creating another potentially significant and near-term commercial opportunity. In addition, we continue to enroll and dose patients in a twelve-week Phase 2 dose-ranging proof-of-concept study of VX-548 in diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a form of peripheral neuropathic pain. I am pleased to share, we also anticipate completing this Phase 2 study towards the end of this year or beginning of next. Transitioning now to inaxaplin or VX-147, the first potential medicine to target the underlying cause of APOL1-mediated kidney disease or AMKD. In March, we were very pleased with the publication of the Phase 2 results for inaxaplin in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
			"Importantly, the paper was accompanied by an editorial and a feature on the science behind the study. We see this coverage in the New England Journal of Medicine as underscoring the importance of the inaxaplin data and the medicine's potential. The Phase 2b dose ranging portion of the global Phase 2, 3 pivotal study remains on track to complete this year. Recall, this study has a preplanned interim analysis at 48-weeks of treatment, which, if positive, could serve as the basis to seek accelerated approval in the U.S. With inaxaplin, we see the potential to bring a first-in-class treatment to the approximately 100,000 patients with AMKD in the U.S. and Europe and unlock a multibillion-dollar market opportunity. Moving now to Type one diabetes.",
			"There are more than 2.5 million people with Type one diabetes in North America and Europe alone, and we are committed to delivering a transformative, if not, curative medicine for this disease. We have three programs in our type one diabetes portfolio, all of which use the same fully differentiated insulin producing islet cells, which have already demonstrated proof-of-concept. Our first program or VX-880, the naked cell program use a standard immunosuppressive to protect the islet cells from the immune system. I am pleased to share that both part A and part B of the study are now fully enrolled and dosed. In both portions of the study, dosing of patients with staggered with Part A patients receiving half dose and Part B patients receiving the full target dose.",
			"The next step in the program is Part C in which patients will be treated concurrently with the full target dose. This should facilitate faster timelines. We look forward to sharing VX-880 data from more patients and with longer duration of follow-up at medical congresses this year, including the ADA Scientific Sessions in June. Our second program, VX-264 or the cells plus device program encapsulates these same cells in a proprietary device that is designed to shield the cells from the body's immune system, and hence there is no requirement for immunosuppressants. Both the IND in the U.S. and the CTA in Canada have cleared. Site activation and study initiation activities are underway in both the U.S. and Canada, and we look forward to enrolling and dosing patients in this Phase I, II study in the near-term.",
			"Third, our hypoimmune program in which we added the same cells to cloak them from the immune system. This would represent another path to obviating the need for immunosuppressives. In March, we expanded our collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics into type one diabetes and this new licensing agreement will enable us to use CRISPR-Cas9 to edit the cells. This research stage program continues to make progress. Lastly, also in the T1D portfolio, the ViaCyte VCTX-211 hypoimmune program using a ViaCyte cell line remains on track. This program is finished enrollment and dosing in Group one of the Phase 1, Phase 2 study. Let me conclude with our Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency or AATD program, which continues to enroll both the Phase 2 study for VX-864 and the Phase 1 study for VX-634.",
			"Photo by freestocks on Unsplash",
			"The Phase 2 program for VX-864 is a 40 eight week study in patients with AATD that will assess both liver clearance of the polymer and serum functional AAT levels. This study is projected to complete enrollment later this year. The Phase 1 healthy volunteer study of VX-634, the next in class molecule with multi-fold greater potency and better drug-like properties is projected to complete this year. With that, I'll now turn over the call to Stuart.",
			"<strong>Stuart Arbuckle:</strong> Thanks, Reshma. From a commercial perspective, our focus continues to be to reach all patients eligible for our CFTR modulators and maintain high levels of adherence among patients already on therapy, while also preparing for potential near term launches for exa-cel, VX-548 in acute pain, and the vanzacaftor triple combination in CF. I'll first review our CF first quarter commercial results and then the longer term outlook for our CF portfolio. I will then comment on the exa-cel opportunity and our launch preparations, given that we have now completed our regulatory filings in the U.S., Europe, and the U.K. We had a strong first quarter with growth predominantly driven by bringing our medicines to younger patients, including TRIKAFTA in children ages six to 11 in the U.S., pus Europe and Canada, and we remain confident in the growth outlook for 2023.",
			"Last week, as expected, we received FDA approval for TRIKAFTA in the U.S. for children ages two years to five years, which adds approximately 900 new patients who for the first time will have a treatment to address the underlying cause of their disease. Turning to the longer term outlook. We see continued growth in CF beyond 2023. As Reshma mentioned, at the beginning of this year, there were more than 20,000 people in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand with CF who could benefit, but were not yet been treated with our approved medicines. Beyond the key growth driver of reaching younger patients through new approvals, we also continue to make progress in securing additional reimbursements. This includes multiple agreements spanning our CF portfolio for younger patients in Europe, and most recently also Australia and New Zealand.",
			"A second driver of CF product growth is the compelling portfolio of real world outcome studies, including model data which validate the positive outlook for long term growth in the overall CF population due to improved survival. Model data related to projected survival and long term health outcomes were recently published in the Journal of Cystic Fibrosis and include a 33.5 year increase in median projected survival with TRIKAFTA therapy versus the standard of care. The third growth driver for our CF portfolio will be our next generation vanzacaftor triple, which provides an opportunity to bring a new and potentially improved treatment option to patients, including those who discontinued therapy with our other medicines. We estimate that there are approximately 6,000 patients who have discontinued one of our existing CFTR modulators.",
			"And longer term, a fourth factor that helped drive extended growth in our CF portfolio is VX-522, which is designed to provide mRNA therapy for the more than 5,000 patients who cannot benefit from CFTR modulators. Shifting now to exa-cel, which holds curative potential for patients with sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. With the recent completion of our exa-cel regulatory submissions in the U.S., Europe, and U.K., our commercial teams are preparing for the potential approval and launch of this multi-billion dollar opportunity. Sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia are neither silent nor undiagnosed diseases. Our initial launch will focus on the approximately 32,000 most severe patients in the U.S. and Europe.",
			"These patients have been sick their entire lives with a chronic often disabling disease that carries a high burden of care. They could soon have the opportunity for a potential lifetime cure. Our launch preparations are informed by extensive market research and insight generation, including through direct engagement with patients, providers, and payers to understand their perceptions of gene therapy and the potential uptake of a product like exa-cel. We are encouraged by the strong interest and enthusiasm shown by all stakeholders for a genetic therapy that could provide transformative benefit for patients. Starting with patients. The journey for someone to receive exa-cel can be summarized in three key phases. One, the pre-treatment period where patients decide a genetic therapy is right for them, and are referred to an authorized treatment center by their hematologists and begin the cell collection process.",
			"Two, the manufacturing period where a patient cells are edited and become the exa-cel drug product. And three, the treatment period where a patient receives myeloablative conditioning, then their edited cells, and is followed for successful engraftment. Survey data from sickle cell and beta thalassemia patients indicate that more than a quarter strongly believe genetic therapy is the right choice for them. Of the balance, the vast majority want to learn more about future treatment options through their own research and through the lived experience is of exa-cel patients and their treating physicians. With providers, we've learned there is a clear recognition of the differences between various genetic therapy approaches and a strong preference for gene edited therapies like exa-cel over gene insertion approaches using lentivirus.",
			"Our market research suggests that approximately 70% of providers prefer a gene editing approach over other gene therapy mechanisms. Our teams are focused on providing access to key support and systems for both patients and providers to ensure the best possible treatment experienced. Accordingly, we have made strong progress toward ensuring authorized treatment centers are administratively and logistically prepared to initiate the exa-cel treatment journey for patients upon approval. Approximately 50 U.S. centers are actively engaged in the process to become an ATC located in those areas with the highest prevalence of patients. Similarly. in all four key European markets, all 25 targeted ATC sites are in process. Payers are another important area of focus.",
			"We are actively engaging with key commercial and government payers and policymakers in the U.S. and Europe. First, with regard to commercial payers in the U.S. Our conversations are focused on the patient need and clinical profile of exa-cel including dramatic reductions in VOCs and hospitalizations for sickle cell disease patients and in transfusions for beta thalassemia patients. We are confident that payers will recognize exa-cel's value in patient populations where current lifetime cost of care can exceed $4 million. We are working with insurers to ensure broad access for the approximately 35% of sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients who are commercially insured. Now to government payers. Approximately 45% of severe sickle cell disease patients in the U.S. are insured by Medicaid and thus, we've also been working with state agencies to ensure Medicaid patients have broad access to exa-cel.",
			"We recognize that a critical element for adoption is ensuring a separate payment for the exa-cel therapy in addition to the reimbursement already in place for the transplant procedure costs. Encouragingly, many states are already providing access to cell and gene therapies with separate payment policies for the procedure and the therapy, and we continue to engage with state agencies around payment models ahead of the launch. In addition, in February of this year, the Biden administration demonstrated their commitment to ensuring access to cell and gene therapies like exa-cel through the announcement of a CMS demonstration project called the Cell and Gene Therapy or CGT access model. The CGT access model will be administered through CMS's innovation center, which is a total budget of approximately $10 billion for the exploration and testing of novel delivery methods and approaches intended to accelerate and enhance broad Medicaid access for sickle cell disease patients.",
			"The CGT access model will overtime facilitate this in two important ways, by creating a pathway for state Medicaid agencies to delegate authority to CMS to coordinate and facilitate innovative payment models including outcomes-based agreements or OBAs with cell and gene therapy manufacturers like Vertex. And in addition, CMS has confirmed any outcomes based arrangement for inpatient therapies requires payment separate from the hospital inpatient bundle. We view the CGT access model as an important indicator of the understanding of the severity of these diseases and the need to provide broad access to potentially transformative therapies for these historically underserved patient populations. We are extremely excited about the potential for exa-cel, our first commercial launch outside of CF in many years and look forward to updating you further on our launch preparation activities on future calls.",
			"I'm also looking forward to updating you on our continued progress to discover, develop. and secure access to transformative medicines for all people living with CF. I will now turn the call over to Charlie to review the financials.",
			"<strong>Charlie Wagner:</strong> Thanks, Stuart. Vertex's results in the first quarter of 2023 demonstrate our consistent strong performance and attractive growth profile regardless of macroeconomic conditions. First quarter 2023 revenue increased 13% year-over-year to $2.37 billion. Growth was led by a 33% year-over-year increase outside the U.S. on continued strong uptake of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO in markets with recently achieved reimbursement, as well as label extensions into younger age groups. U.S. CF revenue grew 3% year-over-year with ongoing consistent performance. First quarter 2023 combined non-GAAP R&amp;D, acquired IPR&amp;D, and SG&amp;A expenses were $1.2 billion compared to $687 million in the first quarter of 2022. Q1, 2023 results include $347 million of acquired IPR&amp;D charges, compared to just $2 million of such charges in the first quarter of 2022.",
			"First quarter 2023 IPR&amp;D expenses resulted from several new collaborations, which augment our internal innovation efforts as detailed on slide 15, including collaborations with Entrada Therapeutics and DM1 ImmunoGen for gentler conditioning agents and the expansion of our relationship with CRISPR Therapeutics into Type one diabetes. Aside from our investments in external innovation and the resulting higher acquired IPR&amp;D charges, operating expense growth was driven as expected by continued investment in research in our advancing pipeline, which includes mid and late stage clinical assets across eight different disease areas. For example, these investments are directed towards clinical studies for the vanzacaftor triple in CF, VX-548 in acute pain, and type one diabetes, as well as pre-commercial build-out activities for exa-cel and other potential near-term launches.",
			"Given the potentially transformative benefit to patients and multibillion-dollar market opportunities for our programs, we will continue to invest appropriately. First quarter 2023 non-GAAP operating income was $902 million in the quarter, compared to $1.17 billion in the first quarter of 2022. First quarter adjusted earnings per share were $3.05. We ended the quarter with $11.5 billion in cash and investments, as our cash flow generation and balance sheet remain very strong. Now switching to guidance. Given our first quarter results and our consistent execution, there are no changes to our 2023 financial guidance as detailed on slide 16. We continue to expect product revenue guidance of $9.55 billion to $9.7 billion, representing 7% to 9% growth year-over-year.",
			"Note that, this guidance continues to include an expected approximate 1.5 percentage point headwind to our revenue growth, inclusive of our foreign exchange risk management program. As we mentioned in early February, given our years of experience in CF, we have strong visibility to our 2023 revenue guidance range, which is inclusive of expected new approvals like the TRIKAFTA U.S. approval in patients ages two to five and new reimbursements outside the U.S. Note too that 2023 product revenue guidance continues to reflect revenue from cystic fibrosis products only. Exa-cel is not included in guidance as potential approval and launch dates in the EU, UK and US are still to be determined. We are also reiterating our 2023 guidance for combined non-GAAP R&amp;D, acquired IPR&amp;D, and SG&amp;A expenses in the range of $3.9 billion to $4 billion.",
			"Our 2023 non-GAAP operating expense guidance now includes approximately $400 million of upfronts and milestones from previously existing or recently completed BD transactions versus the $300 million that was anticipated at the beginning of the year. Our operating expenses continue to be more than 70% allocated to R&amp;D and are funding the significant continued progress of our multiple mid and late stage clinical development programs. Additionally, we are funding the expansion of our commercialization capabilities in anticipation of the multibillion dollar market opportunities represented by our programs with near term launch potential. Our guidance for projected full year 2023 non-GAAP effective tax rate of 21% to 22% is also unchanged. In closing, Vertex performed exceptionally well in the first quarter of 2023.",
			"We delivered strong revenue growth, invested internally and externally, and accelerated programs across our diverse pipeline. We're also proud of our industry leading culture of innovation that we believe will continue to drive long term success. A few highlights from our recently published Corporate Responsibility Report are found on slide 17. And as we continue to advance our programs in 2023, we anticipate further important milestones as highlighted on slide 18 to mark our continued progress in multiple disease areas. We look-forward to updating you on our progress on future calls. And I'll ask Susie to begin the Q&amp;A period.",

			"Novo Nordisk operates under two segments: Diabetes and Obesity Care and the Rare disease segment.",
			"The Diabetes and Obesity Care segment’s sales were DKK 48.8 billion, which represents growth of 31%. In Diabetes Care, fast-acting insulin, Fiasp’s revenues were up 3%. NovoRapid revenues were down 10%. Human insulin revenues were also down 11%. Premix insulin (Ryzodeg and NovoMix) revenues declined by 7%. Also, sales of long-acting insulins (Tresiba, Xultophy and Levemir) decreased 14%.",

			"Obesity Care (Saxenda and Wegovy) sales were up 124% year over year. Wegovy sales increased significantly after the company solved supply issues in the United States for the drug.

This increase was due to International Operations and North America Operations owing to Wegovy relaunch, promotional activities related to Ozempic and Rybelsus as well as Obesity care market development activities.",
			"Research and development costs were up 29% in DKK and increased 28% at CER from the year-ago quarter figures. Higher costs were driven by clinical activity for late-stage studies and increased early research activities compared to the first quarter of 2022.",
			"Administrative costs increased 10% in DKK and were up 9% at CER from the year-ago quarter’s figures.",
			"For 2023, the company now expects sales to grow 24-30% (earlier estimate – 13-19%), while operating profit is now expected to register 28-34% growth as compared with the earlier forecast of 13-19%.",
			"The increase in guidance primarily reflected Wegovy prescription trends in the first quarter and higher full-year expectations for sales of Wegovy in the United States. Additionally, a second contract manufacturer of Novo Nordisk is now ready to begin production, which is anticipated to increase Wegovy’s supply capacity.",

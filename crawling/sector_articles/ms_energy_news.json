			"Portfolio Wealth Advisors President and CIO Lee Munson joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss Warren Buffett's comments on a potential purchase of Occidental, interest in Apple, and outlook for streaming platforms.",
			"[AUDIO LOGO]",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">-</span> Warren Buffett is putting an end to speculation that Berkshire Hathaway might buy Occidental. The CEO saying, quote, \"We are not going to be making an offer for control of Occidental.\" You can see, shares are almost 2%-- almost down 2%, I should say. Now 3% here on the news.",
			"For more, we're joined by Lee Munson, Portfolio Wealth Advisors President and CIO. Lee, good to talk to you today. This is a stock that was one of the best performing in the S&amp;P 500 last year, it is down already. Are you still bullish on Occidental, even after what we heard from Warren Buffett over the weekend?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">LEE MUNSON:</span> Yeah, let's think about what we know about Warren Buffett, OK? He's got about a quarter of the shares, he's authorized to buy half of it, and he's got warrants at 59 bucks, right, where he can buy a ton of it. He's got some preferred stock that he's making 8% yield. I mean, in this market, when we're expecting-- I mean, earnings to be a little flat, maybe a mild recession, why is he in such a big hurry?",
			"But here's the thing, what we do know is where he'd like to buy the stock. And it's around that $59 where he has the warrants. So why is he going to go in and say, hey, I want to pay a big, what, 10, 20, 30% premium when he can sit around all year and accumulate the stock. So I don't necessarily look at this as a negative, I don't think it's a-- I think it just tells you that right around here is a good and fair value that he's comfortable with. And I think that that's all there is really is to read into it.",
			"And he loves the CEO. He loves how that company is run. And that's what we're supposed to gleam from his comments, not that there's going to be some easy money. As if we go and listen on Saturday for stock picks, right. That's not what the point of the Berkshire Annual Meeting is. It's to try to get some sense of wisdom from these two old guys.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">-</span> Yeah, Lee, that's interesting because when you take a look at this share reaction today, you'd think that maybe it brought some fear out there among shareholders, just in terms of what exactly the future looks like for Occidental. But it sounds, like what you're saying, is that some of these people that have possibly been chasing Buffett here buying in on Occidental Petroleum, they shouldn't necessarily be discouraged by this. Rather, they should be encouraged by how well positioned he thinks the company currently is, right?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">LEE MUNSON:</span> Yeah, and also that he likes the valuation, right? I mean, if you're a value investor, you don't want the stock to jump up all at first, you want to be able to accumulate it at a reasonable price. Remember, this is a guy who has about 20 to 25% of the company right now. And he has-- I mean, he might buy up to half of it. And I know he says, well, we wouldn't know what to do with it right now, right. We don't want to take over the whole firm.",
			"He didn't say he doesn't want to accumulate more. But he did make it very clear, it's hard for him to want to buy the whole company when he's going to be giving up a bunch of yield. So I think you just have to think about what his psychology is, right. He's not here to give you a hot stock pick. He's not here to make you rich on some sort of buyout rumor. What he's here to do is use accumulating companies that he thinks that you can compound in the future and make a lot of money.",
			"And when he says the words, we've got all these warrants around $59, and he says, oh, we we're comforted. We like that we have all these warrants. We like that we can buy it at roughly the price it's trading at today, right. So if he likes $59, that means we should like $59 and consider accumulating. If you're looking to buy an individual stock in the energy arena, I would agree and say that this is probably one of your better bets.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">-</span> Yeah, Lee, you could argue that Warren Buffett, sort of a calming voice over the weekends in light of the choppiness that we saw last week, especially with the banks. Apple, specifically, he highlighted that we know he's added to those holdings recently, but he said, look, this is a better company than any we own. In fact, he said I made some mistakes a few years ago when I sold shares when I shouldn't have. I'm curious what stood out to you in some of those comments that we got from him on that space because you talk about him value investing. I mean, Apple has been steady value for him.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">LEE MUNSON:</span> Well, it has. And I think it should suggest that-- when he says, I don't know what interest rates are going to be in 5 or 10 years, I don't know. I think there's another company-- I think it might have been Ford Motor Company or Tesla or something like that-- where he says, I don't know where it's going to be in 5 or 10 years but he said, I believe I know where Apple is going to be 5 to 10 years from now.",
			"And what he means when he says that, the way I interpret that, because I've been reading his annual shareholder letter forever, I've been watching this stuff since I was a little kid, he believes that Apple will still be able to compound at a reasonable rate of return. In fact, he thinks Apple is his best compounder right now, right.",
			"And so when he thinks that he has that future site, I think that what it means is that you can tell me that we don't know where Apple, the share price is going to be over the next three months, but he definitely is long on this stock. He thinks it's the one best place where he wants to keep his money, that's why it's such a large position. And he thinks it's going to continue to compound.",
			"Now the valuation is a different thing. We've seen Warren Buffett, quarter to quarter, year to year, chop certain positions just based on valuation, but he's not saying that right now. And because Apple is the largest component of the S&amp;P 500, I think that bodes well for the broader cap weight index, which everybody wants to hate on right now. I think the issue is that everybody hates that they don't own only five companies of the S&amp;P 500. But I don't think it's time to necessarily ditch out on the S&amp;P because of that.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">-</span> Lee, what about some of his comments? I mean, Apple clearly has worked out for Buffett. What did you make of what he had to say about streaming? Because he was a little bit more-- much more critical of what we have seen in that space, yet he's sticking with his investment, has stuck with his investment in Paramount.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">LEE MUNSON:</span> The problem with value investors, we all stick with some companies that we should sell, and we sort of kick ourselves in the head. Even 92-year-old Buffett will do that too. Here's what we need to know, Buffett is very clear, there's not going to be a bunch of new eyeballs coming to streaming, right. We're not going to have a billion new people coming to streaming.",
			"And he told this story about the gas station that he owned when he was 20. You know, like when we were teenagers and owned gas stations and things like that. And he said, his gas station out in Omaha, his profit was determined by his larger competitor, right. And he's saying streaming is the same way. You have big players and none of them want to quit.",
			"And you can tell Buffett's frustrated with it. He wants to shake out some of these weak players, and they're not being shaken out. And so I understand that pain, I own Disney, right, Disney Plus, Hulu. Streaming is a big reason why I own that Disney stock. He owns Paramount because of streaming.",
			"But as long as we have these major players that are-- basically what's happening is every competitor is keeping the ability to profit from everybody else. So I think you have to stick with the top two or three streamers and hope that we eventually become profitable. But you'll notice he's not selling Paramount. He's not. He just doesn't like the prospects because of that dividend cut.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">-</span> Yeah, just hope that they become profitable, that's a big one there, Lee. Lee Munson, Portfolio Wealth Advisors President and CEO. It's good to talk to you today.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">LEE MUNSON:</span> Thank you."

		"content": [
			"(Bloomberg) -- Aramco plans an additional dividend, potentially raising payouts for investors and Saudi Arabia’s government just as weaker oil prices edge the kingdom’s budget into a deficit.",
			"The move could increase Aramco’s dividend — which at $75.8 billion last year was already the highest of any listed firm — by more than $20 billion in 2023, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. RBC Capital Markets LLC forecasts an increment of $12 billion to $18 billion.",
			"The stock surged as much as 7.2% in early trading, before trimming gains to 3.2%, still taking it to the highest level since September.",
			"Aramco increased dividends by 4% in March and said it wanted to continue growing them over the coming years. It has come under pressure to pay more to boost the attractiveness of the stock relative to those of rivals such as BP Plc and Shell Plc, which have been shelling out billions more to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.",
			"The new “performance-linked dividends” will be calculated as 50%-70% of Saudi Aramco’s annual free cash flow, net of the base payout and external investments, the world’s largest energy company said on Tuesday, shortly before it released earnings. The amount will be “determined with the annual results.”",
			"Low Liquidity",
			"“We have been deleveraging for some time and now we’re comfortable enough to introduce a mechanism that increases dividends in a way that shares the upside,” Chief Financial Officer Ziad Al Murshed said on a call with analysts.",
			"He also hopes it will increase the “relatively low” liquidity in the stock, which only has a free float of 2%. That’s “certainly front and center” of what Aramco is looking at, he said.",
			"The new payouts may increase Aramco’s dividend yield to around 4.2%, according to RBC, putting it more in line with peers.",
			"The Saudi Arabian government directly owns 90% Aramco, with a further 8% held by the sovereign wealth fund. The stock is now up 15% this year in Riyadh, outperforming that of Western Big Oil firms such as Shell and Exxon Mobil Corp.",
			"The country’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, has said the government may sell more shares in Aramco through a secondary offering.",
			"Aramco made a net profit of $31.9 billion for the first quarter, slightly below analysts’ expectations and down 19% from a year earlier. Free cash flow was $30.9 billion and the quarterly dividend was maintained at $19.5 billion.",
			"The gearing ratio, a measure of net debt to equity, fell further into negative territory, reflecting improved finances. It dropped to -10.3% from -7.9% in December.",
			"The firm’s free cash flow soared to almost $150 billion last year as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine roiled energy markets and pushed oil above $125 a barrel. That meant Aramco easily covered its annual dividend, a crucial source of funding for the Saudi government.",
			"The kingdom reported a $770 million fiscal deficit for the first quarter as spending on public sector salaries and massive projects to diversify the economy from energy increased. Growth slowed to 3.9% year-on-year, compared with 10% at the start of 2022.",
			"Oil prices have dipped sharply since the middle of last year after the global economy weakened and central banks raised interest rates to combat inflation. Brent averaged $82 a barrel between January and March. The benchmark has since fallen further to around $76.",
			"“The markets overreacted,” Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser said, reiterating that oil demand will rise 2% this year to a record of around 102 million barrels a day, with China and India continuing to show strong growth.",
			"Aramco, based in Dhahran in eastern Saudi Arabia, is targeting capital expenditure of $45 billion to $55 billion for 2023. It’s spending billions of dollars to raise its daily oil-production capacity to 13 million barrels from 12 million by 2027, and its gas output by more than 50% this decade.",
			"Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, has criticized Western companies for not investing more in fossil fuels and for trying to transition to cleaner forms of energy too quickly. While Aramco is also putting money into solar and hydrogen, it says fossil fuels will be needed for decades to ensure the world has secure and affordable energy.",
			"“We believe oil and gas will remain critical,” said Nasser.",
			"Still, much of Aramco’s spending is focused on petrochemicals in Asia. The company believes the use of plastics, paint and fertilizers — often made from crude-based chemicals — will rise over the coming decades. Selling more petrochemicals could protect it against any slowing of demand for gasoline and diesel as electric vehicles become more popular.",
			"Aramco bought 10% of Rongsheng Petrochemical Co., one of China’s refining giants, for $3.6 billion in March, a move that will expand its presence in the world’s biggest energy importer. That deal and another to invest in a new $12 billion refining and petrochemical plant in the northeastern province of Liaoning could see the company eventually ship nearly 700,000 barrels of additional oil a day to China for conversion into chemicals.",
			"“Our global downstream strategy is gaining momentum,” Nasser said.",
			"The downstream unit, responsible for fuel distribution and trading as well as refining and chemicals, made a pretax profit of $3.4 billion in the first quarter, down 67% from the same period of 2022. That was mainly due to a fall in chemicals margins.",
			"The unit is still dwarfed by the upstream, or production, unit, which generated earnings of $57 billion.",
			"Aramco, which produces all the oil in Saudi Arabia, pumped 10.4 million barrels a day of crude between January and March. That figure will probably drop in the second quarter because OPEC+ — an alliance led by Saudi Arabia and Russia — announced supply cuts. The Saudis are meant to lower output by 500,000 barrels a day from this month.",

			"The terms and conditions of the Tender Offer are described in an Offer to Purchase dated May 9, 2023 (as it may be amended or supplemented, the \"Offer to Purchase\"). The Tender Offer is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions as set forth in the Offer to Purchase, including the receipt of aggregate gross proceeds of at least $750.0 million from the concurrent public offering of senior debt securities issued by CPCo and guaranteed by COP, on or prior to the Early Settlement Date on terms acceptable to COP. Subject to applicable law, the purchasers may waive any and all of these conditions or extend, terminate or withdraw the Tender Offer with respect to one or more Series of Notes and/or increase or decrease the Maximum Aggregate Purchase Price. The Tender Offer is not conditioned upon any minimum amount of Notes being tendered. Capitalized terms used in this news release and not defined herein have the meanings given to them in the Offer to Purchase.",
			"The amounts of each Series of Notes that are purchased in the Tender Offer will be determined in accordance with the priorities identified in the column \"Acceptance Priority Level\" in the table above. The Tender Offer will expire one minute after 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on June 6, 2023, unless extended (such date and time, as the same may be extended, the \"Expiration Date\") or earlier terminated. In order to receive the applicable Total Tender Offer Consideration, holders of Notes subject to the Tender Offer must validly tender and not validly withdraw their Notes before the Early Tender Deadline, which is 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 22, 2023, unless extended. Holders of Notes subject to the Tender Offer who validly tender their Notes after the Early Tender Deadline and before the Expiration Date and whose Notes are accepted for purchase will receive the applicable Late Tender Offer Consideration.",
			"The applicable Total Tender Offer Consideration for each $1,000 in principal amount of Notes tendered and not withdrawn before the Early Tender Deadline and accepted for payment pursuant to the Tender Offer on the Early Settlement Date (as defined below) will be determined in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase. The consideration will be determined by reference to a fixed spread specified for each Series of Notes over the yield based on the bid-side price of the applicable Reference U.S. Treasury Security specified in the table above, as fully described in the Offer to Purchase. The consideration will be calculated by the Lead Dealer Managers for the Tender Offer at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the business day immediately following the Early Tender Deadline, unless extended (such date and time, as the same may be extended, the \"Price Determination Date\"). The Price Determination Date is expected to be May 23, 2023. The Early Tender Premium for each Series of Notes is $30 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. The Late Tender Offer Consideration for the Notes purchased pursuant to the Tender Offer will be calculated by taking the Total Tender Offer Consideration for the applicable Series of Notes and subtracting from it the Early Tender Premium of $30 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes.",
			"In addition to the applicable Total Tender Offer Consideration or applicable Late Tender Offer Consideration, as the case may be, accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the applicable Settlement Date will be paid in cash on all validly tendered Notes accepted for purchase in the Tender Offer. The purchase price plus accrued and unpaid interest for Notes that are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn on or before the Early Tender Deadline and accepted for purchase will be paid by the Company in same day funds promptly following the Early Tender Deadline (the \"Early Settlement Date\"). The Company expects that the Early Settlement Date will be May 25, 2023, the second business day after the Price Determination Date. The purchase price plus accrued and unpaid interest for Notes that are validly tendered after the Early Tender Deadline and on or before the Expiration Date and accepted for purchase will be paid by the Company in same day funds promptly following the Expiration Date (the \"Final Settlement Date\"). The Company expects that the Final Settlement Date will be June 8, 2023, the second business day after the Expiration Date, assuming Notes representing an aggregate purchase price equal to the Maximum Aggregate Purchase Price are not purchased on the Early Settlement Date. No tenders will be valid if submitted after the Expiration Date. If Notes are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn having an aggregate purchase price equal to or greater than the Maximum Aggregate Purchase Price as of the Early Tender Deadline, Holders who validly tender Notes after the Early Tender Deadline but on or before the Expiration Date will not have any of their Notes accepted for purchase. Holders of Notes subject to the Tender Offer who validly tender their Notes on or before the Early Tender Deadline may not withdraw their Notes after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 22, 2023, unless extended (such date and time, as the same may be extended, the \"Withdrawal Deadline\"), except in the limited circumstances described in the Offer to Purchase. Holders of Notes subject to the Tender Offer who validly tender their Notes after the Withdrawal Deadline but on or before the Expiration Date may not withdraw their Notes except in the limited circumstances described in the Offer to Purchase.",
			"Subject to the Maximum Aggregate Purchase Price, all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or before the Early Tender Deadline having a higher Acceptance Priority Level will be accepted before any validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes having a lower Acceptance Priority Level, and all Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Deadline having a higher Acceptance Priority Level will be accepted before any Notes tendered after the Early Tender Deadline having a lower Acceptance Priority Level. However, if Notes are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn having an aggregate purchase price less than the Maximum Aggregate Purchase Price as of the Early Tender Deadline, Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or before the Early Tender Deadline will be accepted for purchase in priority to Notes tendered after the Early Tender Deadline, even if such Notes tendered after the Early Tender Deadline have a higher Acceptance Priority Level than Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or before the Early Tender Deadline.

			"With its stock down 8.3% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Chevron (NYSE:CVX).

			"ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.",

			"<strong>Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:</strong>",
			"Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity",
			"So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Chevron is:",
			"22% = US$36b ÷ US$160b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).",
			"The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.22.",
			"We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.",
			"First thing first, we like that Chevron has an impressive ROE. However, a comparison to the industry average of 33% stops us from getting too excited. However, we are pleased to see the impressive 25% net income growth reported by Chevron over the past five years. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio. However, not to forget, the company does have a high ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. So the high ROE levels also provide some context to the high earnings growth seen by the company.",
			"Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Chevron's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 21% in the same period, which is great to see.",
			"Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for CVX?

			"Chevron has a three-year median payout ratio of 32% (where it is retaining 68% of its income) which is not too low or not too high. So it seems that Chevron is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered.",
			"Moreover, Chevron is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 47% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 16%, over the same period.",
			"Overall, we are quite pleased with Chevron's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company has seen significant growth in its earnings backed by a respectable ROE and a high reinvestment rate.

			"Socially responsible investing is quickly becoming a norm rather than an exception as more and more people understand the importance of taking into account social conscience when making investment decisions. <a class=\"link yahoo-link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Socially responsible investing;elm:context_link;itc:0;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-best-ethical-companies-invest-181936013.html\">Socially responsible investing</a> includes investing in companies that adhere to ethical or socially conscious business practices or steer clear of businesses or actions that harm the society according to many, including tobacco, alcohol, gambling, weapons, carbon emissions, child labor, etc. Socially responsible investing, ESG investing and impact investing have all seen a huge rise in popularity over the past few years.",
			"According to estimates from Bloomberg Intelligence, assets in the ESG space were expected to reach $41 trillion by the end of 2022. Historically, Europe has been at the forefront of ESG policy making and ESG investing but the Bloomberg report said that the US is now leading the investments in the ESG space.",
			"One of the most important trends seen in the socially responsible investing or ESG investing circles is the rise of ETFs and mutual funds. These give individual investors an easy and cost-effective way to have exposure to socially responsible companies. As an individual investors it’s difficult to find which companies are sticking to socially responsible business practices and ESG goals. So why not leave this legwork to the experts and just put your money into an ETF or mutual fund that is focused on finding such companies? The Bloomberg report cited data from Morningstar, which says that money held in ESG ETFs and sustainable mutual funds worldwide jumped 53% in 2021 to reach $2.7 trillion.",
			"As investors grow socially conscious, hedge funds are also upping their activism in the space and many companies are facing heat from ESG-focused hedge funds that are forcing companies to get their act together and stick to environment-friendly business practices. For example, environment-focused fund Engine No. 1 in 2021 managed to defeat oil giant ExxonMobil and installed its two members on the company’s board. The fund, which was not popular until this victory, received support from some of the biggest institutional investors of ExxonMobil, including BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. This shows the massive change ESG investing is ushering in at the Wall Street and how many investment firms and companies either willingly or unwillingly have to give in to this pressure.",
			"Engine No.1 in a scathing <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:letter;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://reenergizexom.com/materials/letter-to-the-board-of-directors-february-22\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">letter</a> to ExxonMobil’s board of directors criticized the company’s lack of adherence to its goals and targets related to climate. Here’s what the historic letter said:",
			"But not all is good and rosy for the ESG investing world. ESG investors and climate activist funds are facing a backlash from some circles and ESG funds also saw a huge exodus of investors amid losses and tough macro backdrop.",
			"For example, the iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF assets have dropped to $13.8 billion from $25 billion recorded a year ago, according to a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Bloomberg report;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-30/why-esg-in-america-may-face-a-rough-road-ahead-this-year?leadSource=uverify%20wall\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg report</a>. The report said that as of March 2023, global assets of ESG ETFs were about $471 billion, as compared to $486 billion recorded in January. The report said that investors pulled a whopping $4.4 billion in a single week in March.",
			"The report also said the industry was facing a “concentration” problem, in which a handful of major funds were invested in the ESG space and when a single major fund decides to pull money from a fund, the overall industry sees a decline.",
			"Some investors are also getting frustrated with what they believe an overemphasis on environment in the ESG spectrum. Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones, who is the cofounder of  Just Capital, believes worker treatment should be the center of the ESG equation and not the environment.",
			"According to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNBC;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/11/paul-tudor-jones-hedge-fund-billionaire-wants-to-do-away-with-esg.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC</a>, Jones said:",

			"The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Mastercard Inc., The Coca-Cola Co. and T-Mobile US, Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.<br/><br/>You can <strong>see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong><br/><br/><strong>Mastercard</strong> shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+18.0% vs. +10.2%). The company's numerous acquisitions are helping it to grow addressable markets and drive new revenue streams. We expect the company's top line at $25.2 billion in 2023. The COVID-19 crisis accelerated the adoption of digital and contactless solutions, providing an opportunity for MA's business to expedite its shift to the digital mode.<br/><br/>Mastercard is well-poised to gain from steady cash-generating abilities. A strong capital position allows it to pursue acquisitions and prudently deploy capital.<br/><br/>However, steep operating expenses might stress margins. High rebates and incentives may weigh on the company's net revenues. Its dividend yield is still lower than the industry average. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.<br/><br/>(You can <strong>read the full research report on Mastercard here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br/><br/>Shares of <strong>Coca-Cola</strong> have gained +1.4% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry's gain of +10.3%. The company's earnings and sales improved year over year and surpassed the Zacks analyst estimates in the quarter. KO's results benefited from the continued momentum in its business.<br/><br/>Sales gained from revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and a rise in concentrate sales. It is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments. It provided an upbeat guidance for 2023.<br/><br/>However, shares of Coca-Cola lagged the industry in the past three months. Pressures from higher supply chain costs, higher marketing spends and currency headwinds are concerning.<br/><br/>(You can <strong>read the full research report on Coca-Cola here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br/><br/>Shares of <strong>T-Mobile US</strong> have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+18.0% vs. -4.8%). With industry-leading growth in postpaid and broadband customers driven by superior 5G network and focus on customers, T-Mobile reported solid first-quarter 2023 results driven by diligent execution of operational plans.<br/><br/>The company has augmented its 5G footprint by introducing 5G Home Internet services in several states. T-Mobile plans to reach 300 million people within 2023. It intends to bring more competition to home broadband, especially in underserved rural markets.<br/><br/>However, T-Mobile operates in a fiercely competitive and almost saturated U.S. telecom market, which lowers its growth potential to some extent. Several promotional activities to lure additional customers are further eroding profitability. Lower equipment revenues due to a challenging macroeconomic environment remain a concern. Debt obligation woes also persist.<br/><br/>(You can <strong>read the full research report on T-Mobile US here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br/><br/>Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Shopify Inc. and EOG Resources, Inc.",

			"For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.",
			"In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like <strong>Occidental Petroleum</strong> (<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:NYSE:OXY;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-oxy/occidental-petroleum?blueprint=2501320&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=intro&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NYSE:OXY</a>), which has not only revenues, but also profits.

			"In business, profits are a key measure of success; and share prices tend to reflect earnings per share (EPS) performance. So a growing EPS generally brings attention to a company in the eyes of prospective investors. It's an outstanding feat for Occidental Petroleum to have grown EPS from US$2.12 to US$13.83 in just one year. While it's difficult to sustain growth at that level, it bodes well for the company's outlook for the future. This could point to the business hitting a point of inflection.",
			"One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The good news is that Occidental Petroleum is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 20.5 percentage points to 37%, over the last year. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.",

Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$120m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.2% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.",
			"Occidental Petroleum's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics.

			"Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Hess Corporation (<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:NYSE:HES;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-hes/hess?blueprint=2501269&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=intro&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NYSE:HES</a>) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!",
			"Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Simply Wall St analysis model;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://github.com/SimplyWallSt/Company-Analysis-Model/blob/master/MODEL.markdown#discounted-cash-flow-dcf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Simply Wall St analysis model</a>.",
			"<span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:See our latest analysis for Hess;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-hes/hess?blueprint=2501269&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Hess </a></span>",
			"We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.",
			"A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:",
			"<i>(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)</i><br/><strong>Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF)</strong> = US$20b",
			"After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.6%.",
			"<strong>Terminal Value (TV)</strong>= FCF<sub>2032</sub> × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.3b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.6%– 2.1%) = US$72b",
			"<strong>Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)</strong>= TV / (1 + r)<sup>10</sup>= US$72b÷ ( 1 + 9.6%)<sup>10</sup>= US$29b",
			"The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$49b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$137, the company appears about fair value at a 14% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.",
			"Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Hess as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.263. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.",
			"<strong>Strength</strong>",
			"<strong>Weakness</strong>",
			"<strong>Opportunity</strong>",
			"<strong>Threat</strong>",
			"Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Hess, we've put together three further factors you should further research:",

			"Chicago, IL – May 9, 2023 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Exxon XOM, Chevron CVX and BP BP.",
			"Crude oil prices appear to be reversing last week's losses, but prices are down significantly from the year-earlier level. There are multiple factors at play in the commodity's price action, including supply-demand fundamentals to OPEC action, the Ukraine war, the exchange value of the U.S. dollar, and even seasonality.",
			"Worries about oil demand trends stemming from an uncertain outlook for the U.S. economy and a less-than-robust post-Covid momentum in China appear to be the main reasons for the commodity's recent weakness. But given constrained crude oil exploration spending trends, particularly outside of the OPEC countries, the commodity's long-term supply fundamentals indicate higher-for-longer oil prices going forward.",
			"The pandemic was tough on the oil patch, with the immediate aftermath of Covid lockdowns pushing oil futures into negative territory. But the rebound was equally impressive.",
			"As you can see above, the Zacks Energy sector is on track to bring in $42 billion in earnings in 2023 Q1, up from $36.5 billion in the year-earlier period but down significantly from the recent 'peak earnings' of $65.4 billion in 2022 Q2.",
			"You can also see in the above chart that the group lost money in the 2020 Q2 and Q3 periods as a result of Covid lockdowns.",
			"Keep in mind that the Energy patch was struggling on the earnings front even in the pre-Covid period.",
			"What this chart is telling us is that the Zacks Energy sector is currently expected to bring in $158.4 billion in earnings this year, down from $210 billion in 2022.",
			"This year's $158.4 billion is a significant decline from last year's $210 billion tally, but it is still the all-time second-highest earnings tally for the group, second only to the 2022 record.",
			"You can see in the chart below that the group's previous record of $127.5 billion in 2008, when oil prices went above $140 per barrel, is not only below the 2023 level but also below what is currently expected for the next two years.",
			"A big reason for the group's improved profitability picture in the current cycle is the enhanced efficiencies that oil producers were forced to achieve in the 2005 to 2019 period.",
			"Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that the Energy sector was one of only a handful that enjoyed positive estimate revisions in 2022, even as estimates for most of the other sectors were coming down. This trend reversed around last Fall when the oil prices shifted course.",
			"You can see this in the revisions trend for the oil majors like Exxon, Chevron, BP and others.",
			"Chevron is currently expected to earn $14.39 per share in 2023. This is down from $14.56 per share at the end of March 2023 and $17.53 per share at the end of September 2022.",
			"The corresponding revisions chart for Exxon and BP isn't as stark as what you can see above with Chevron, as it has long been seen as the 'oilier' of the 'super majors.'",
			"Exxon, Chevron, and the broader Energy space were all standout stock market performers in 2022 but have struggled this year as the revisions trend has reversed.",
			"The sustainability of the group's stock market performance will be determined by how enduring current commodity-price trends turn out to be.",
			"These stocks don't need spiking oil prices; they need stable prices instead. Greater confidence in the forward price curve will keep the revisions trend stable, which should help these stocks reverse their recent underperformance.",
			"It is hard to accurately forecast the near-term outlook for the U.S. and global economy, which drives oil's demand function. But we know from history that down economic cycles are followed by rebounds and growth. Given the sub-par spending trends on oil exploration at present, particularly outside of the OPEC region, it is reasonable to envision a very tight supply-demand balance once current macroeconomic clouds lift.",
			"Including all the quarterly reports that came out through Monday morning, May 8<sup>th</sup>, we now have Q1 earnings from 430 S&amp;P 500 members, or 86% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are down -3.7% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues, with 77.4% beating EPS estimates and 74.9% beating revenue estimates.",
			"The proportion of these companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 62.3%.",
			"<em>Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have been referring to the overall picture emerging from the Q1 earnings season as good enough; not great, but not bad either. With results from more than half of the S&amp;P 500 members already out, we can confidently say that corporate earnings aren't headed towards the 'cliff' that market bears were warning us of. </em>",
			"<em>The way we see it, the 'better-than-feared' view of the Q1 earnings season at this stage may be a bit unfair, given how resilient corporate profitability has turned out to be. But the view isn't entirely off the mark either.</em>",
			"To get a sense of what is currently expected, 2023 Q1 earnings are expected to be down -4.3% on +4.2% higher revenues. This would follow the -5.4% earnings decline in the preceding period (2022 Q4) on +5.9% higher revenues.",
			"Embedded in these 2023 Q1 earnings and revenue growth projections is the expectation of continued margin pressures, which has been a recurring theme in recent quarters. The favorable surprise in the Q1 reporting cycle has been on the margins front, which has come out better than what the market was factoring in ahead of the start of this reporting cycle.",
			"On the revisions front, there is a notable sign of stabilization lately, with estimates not falling as much as would have normally been expected, given the overall sentiment about the macro backdrop.",
			"We see this favorable revisions trend for the current period (2023 Q2) as well as for full year 2023.",

			"Independent oil refiner and marketer, <strong>Marathon Petroleum Corporation</strong> MPC reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.09, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.74 and compared with a profit of merely $1.49 per share in the year-ago period.<br/><br/>The company’s bottom line was favorably impacted by the stronger-than-expected performance of its key Refining &amp; Marketing segment. Operating income of the segment totaled $3 billion, ahead of its Zacks Consensus Estimate by 19.9%.<br/><br/>Marathon Petroleum reported revenues of $35.1 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32.4 billion but dropped 8.6% year over year on lower-than-expected throughput volumes.<br/><br/>In October 2022, the company completed its target of buying back $15 billion in common stock. This was after Marathon Petroleum concluded the sale of its Speedway business, comprising approximately 3,900 c-stores in 35 states to Japan-based retail group Seven &amp;i Holdings — the owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain — for $21 billion.<br/><br/>In the first quarter, MPC repurchased $3.2 billion of shares and a further $1.2 billion worth of shares in April. The company, which gave an additional $5 billion share repurchase approval, currently has a remaining authorization of $9 billion.<br/>",

			" ",
			"<em><strong>Refining &amp; Marketing:</strong></em> The Refining &amp; Marketing segment reported an operating income of $3 billion, which soared from the year-ago profit of just $768 million. The jump primarily reflects higher year-over-year margins and refined product sales that more than offset lower capacity utilization.<br/><br/>Specifically, the refining margin of $26.15 per barrel improved significantly from $15.31 a year ago. Capacity utilization during the quarter was 89% compared to 91% in the corresponding period of 2022. The tickdown reflects planned maintenance activity in the Gulf Coast region.",
			"Meanwhile, total refined product sales volumes were 3,352 thousand barrels per day (mbpd), up from 3,293 mbpd in the year-ago quarter. Throughput also edged up from 2,833 mbpd in the year-ago quarter to 2,837 mbpd but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2,851 mbpd.<br/><br/>Further, operating costs per barrel increased 8.8% year over year to $5.68. The cost escalation was blamed on turnaround-related outgo.<br/><br/><em><strong>Midstream:</strong></em> This unit mainly reflects Marathon Petroleum’s general partner and majority limited partner interests in <strong>MPLX LP</strong> MPLX — a publicly traded master limited partnership that owns, operates, develops and acquires pipelines and other midstream assets.<br/><br/>Segment profitability was $1.2 billion, up 13.2% from the first quarter of 2022. Earnings were supported by higher tariff rates and the stable, fee-based revenues from MPLX’s wide range of midstream energy services.",
			"Marathon Petroleum, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), reported expenses of $31 billion in first-quarter 2023, down 4.2% from the year-ago quarter.<br/><br/>You can see <strong>the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br/><br/>In the reported quarter, Marathon Petroleum spent $690 million on capital programs (61% on Refining &amp; Marketing and 35% on the Midstream segment) compared to $573 million in the year-ago period. As of Mar 31, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $8 billion and total debt, including that of MPLX, of $27.3 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 45.5%.",
			"While we have discussed MPC’s fourth-quarter results in detail, let’s see how some other refining companies have fared this earnings season.<br/><br/><strong>Phillips 66</strong> PSX reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.21, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.58. Moreover, the bottom line improved significantly from a profit of $1.32 per share in the year-ago quarter.<br/><br/>PSX’s worldwide margins almost doubled to $20.72 per barrel from the year-ago quarter’s $10.83. The same in the Central Corridor and Atlantic Basin/Europe increased to $26.86 and $16.13 per barrel from the year-ago levels of $7.89 and $11.71, respectively. In the Gulf Coast, the metric registered an improvement to $21.28 per barrel from $8.59 in the prior-year quarter. However, the West Coast witnessed a decline in margins from $17.74 per barrel in the year-ago quarter to $16.53 in the March-end quarter of 2023.<br/><br/>Another refining giant, <strong>Valero Energy</strong> VLO, also reported strong first-quarter earnings. The bottom line of $8.27 per share came in well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.24. The outperformance reflects increased refinery throughput volumes and a higher refining margin. In particular, adjusted operating income in the Refining unit amounted to $4.1 billion, surging from $1.5 billion in the year-ago quarter.<br/><br/>At the end of the first quarter, VLO had cash and cash equivalents of $5.5 billion, while the company’s total debt and finance lease obligations amounted to $11.4 billion. Valero’s first-quarter capital investment was $524 million. Of the total, $341 million was allotted for sustaining the business.<br/><br/>Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.",

			"The recent announcements by <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:BP that it is weakening its climate targets;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/02/01/bp-cut-back-renewable-efforts-disappointment-green-push/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BP that it is weakening its climate targets</a>, and the none too subtle hints from Shell being read by the market that it is likely to do something similar, signals that the lure of short-term profit maximisation is trumping the long-term sustainability of these companies and of our planet.",
			"A disorderly climate transition caused by delayed action will not only <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:miss the goals of the Paris climate agreement;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/environment/2021/08/09/paris-15c-climate-goal-set-breached-within-two-decades/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">miss the goals of the Paris climate agreement</a> but directly work against the financial interests of pension funds and other long-term investors and their beneficiaries.",
			"The pivotal role of the sector is why the Church of England Pensions Board, alongside many other investors, has engaged intensely for many years with European oil and gas companies.",
			"It is fair to recognise that we have seen genuine leadership from some of these companies, in no small part thanks to the dialogue with investors.",
			"Companies have set targets and developed detailed strategies to navigate the energy transition.",
			"While none of the major European players' targets and commitments are ambitious enough, they did set companies on a path that aligned more clearly with long-term investors.",
			"Importantly, they also signalled the companies were seeking to be constructive actors in shaping a low-carbon future and that it was in their interests to do so.",
			"As a fund and along with the rest of the market, we are receiving the <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:signals from Shell’s new chief executive;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/05/04/shell-profit-shareholders-windfall-tax-energy-oil-prices/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">signals from Shell’s new chief executive</a> of a return to the pursuit of maximising short-term returns.",
			"Of course, we along with many investors recognised the war in Ukraine has implications for energy security – in the short term.",
			"But the concern is that the short term is now influencing longer-term horizons as enormous profits do not translate into significantly scaled investments in the transition, compared against continued investment in oil and gas production.",
			"Whilst this thinking may provide short-term dividends, it increases medium to long-term risk for pension funds by making the transition less likely and more unstable.",
			"Most importantly, this shift means Shell is moving away from being an actor seeking to positively shape the future in favour of the transition.",
			"Taking this path is a risky strategy for Shell and any other company given the regulatory and policy trends in Europe and North America and the growing public and consumer concerns about climate change.",
			"The widespread move to electrification is happening at pace alongside rapid growth in demand for electric vehicles.",
			"These are positive trends and are only going in one direction.",
			"At Shell's 2021 AGM, we welcomed the progress that had been made, but clearly stated that we were prepared to sell our shareholding unless the company strengthened its targets in particular in the short and medium term.",
			"As we approach our July 2023 engagement deadline and the end of the first phase of Climate Action 100+ engagement, we have lost confidence in the direction of the company.",
			"As such we will be voting against Shell’s Chair and Directors and the transition plan update, and voting for the Follow This shareholder resolution which calls for more ambitious targets.",
			"We do this with genuine regret at the short-term path the company appears to be choosing. But this is not just about Shell, BP and the other oil and gas companies.",
			"The fact that the long term is not being prioritised in the same way means we as investors need to rethink our approach and focus on the demand side, not just the supply side.",
			"More than 60pc of demand for oil comes from the transportation sector, while most gas is used by property and industrial companies.",
			"Therefore, we must pivot our engagement to these other sectors on their use of oil and gas and encourage them to transition to alternative energy sources.",
			"Furthermore, we need a new dialogue with governments to support a phased moratorium on oil and gas.",
			"Informed by the pace at which the demand side can transition, investors should explore with governments how phasing out usage as quickly as possible can be achieved in line with the Paris Agreement and informed by the International Energy Agency.",
			"But in a fair way that does not penalise developing and emerging economies.",
			"Through our vote at Shell’s AGM we are sending a signal about the importance we assign to the low-carbon transition.",
			"Through a focus on rapidly changing demand for oil and gas and supporting increased regulation we hope this may encourage and incentivise companies in the oil and gas sector to follow a path aligned with the future society wants and not the short term.",

			"Calgary, Alberta--(Newsfile Corp. - May 8, 2023) - <b>Suncor Energy (TSX: SU) (NYSE: SU)<br/></b>",
			"\"I am excited to be working with the dedicated Suncor team, and to be leading a company with a long and successful history combined with a unique, physically integrated and high-quality asset base,\" said Rich Kruger, Suncor's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"My goal is to return Suncor to its industry leadership position by focusing on the fundamentals of safety, operational excellence, reliability and profitability to ensure the company delivers superior, long-term shareholder value.\"",
			"<b>Financial Results </b>",
			"<b>Adjusted Operating Earnings</b>",
			"Suncor's adjusted operating earnings were $1.809 billion ($1.36 per common share) in the first quarter of 2023, compared to $2.755 billion ($1.92 per common share) in the prior year quarter, primarily due to decreased crude oil realizations, increased operating expenses and lower upstream production and refinery throughput, partially offset by increased refined product realizations, decreased royalties and income taxes. Adjusted operating earnings were also impacted by a weakening in crude oil benchmark pricing during the current quarter, compared to a strengthening in benchmark pricing in the prior year quarter, resulting in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) inventory valuation loss in the first quarter of 2023, compared to a significant gain in the prior year quarter.",
			"<b>Net Earnings</b>",
			"Suncor's net earnings were $2.052 billion ($1.54 per common share) in the first quarter of 2023, compared to $2.949 billion ($2.06 per common share) in the prior year quarter. In addition to the factors impacting adjusted operating earnings discussed above, net earnings for the first quarter of 2023 included a $302 million gain on the sale of the company's wind and solar assets, an $18 million unrealized loss on risk management activities recorded in other income (loss), a $3 million unrealized foreign exchange loss on the revaluation of U.S. dollar denominated debt recorded in financing expenses and a $38 million income tax expense related to the items noted. Net earnings in the prior year quarter included a $146 million unrealized foreign exchange gain on the revaluation of U.S. dollar denominated debt recorded in financing expenses, a $75 million unrealized gain on risk management activities recorded in other income (loss) and a $27 million income tax expense related to the items noted.",

			"<span>(1) Non-GAAP financial measure. All reconciling items are presented on a before-tax basis and adjusted for income taxes in the income tax (recovery) expense excluded from adjusted operating earnings line. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this news release.</span>",
			"<b>Adjusted Funds from Operations and Cash Flow Provided by Operating Activities</b>",
			"Adjusted funds from operations were $3.002 billion ($2.26 per common share) in the first quarter of 2023, compared to $4.094 billion ($2.86 per common share) in the prior year quarter. Adjusted funds from operations were influenced by the same factors impacting adjusted operating earnings noted above.",
			"Cash flow provided by operating activities, which includes changes in non-cash working capital, was $1.039 billion ($0.78 per common share) in the first quarter of 2023, compared to $3.072 billion ($2.14 per common share) in the prior year quarter. In addition to the factors impacting adjusted funds from operations, cash flow provided by operating activities was impacted by a larger use of cash associated with the company's working capital balances in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the prior year quarter. The use of cash in the first quarter of 2023 was primarily due to income tax payments made relating to the company's 2022 income tax expense, and the timing of commodity tax and royalty payments.",
			"<b>Operating Results</b>",
			"Suncor's total upstream production was 742,100 boe/d in the first quarter of 2023, compared to 766,100 boe/d in the prior year quarter.",
			"The company's net SCO production was 497,800 bbls/d in the first quarter of 2023, compared to 515,300 bbls/d in the prior year quarter, driven by combined upgrader utilization of 93% in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting the impact of unplanned maintenance in the quarter, compared to 96% in the prior year quarter. During the first quarter of 2023, the company leveraged its regional integration and asset flexibility, through the use of internal transfers between assets, to mitigate the impacts of maintenance during the period.",
			"The company's non-upgraded bitumen production increased to 177,300 bbls/d in the first quarter of 2023, compared to 170,400 bbls/d in the prior year quarter, and included a new quarterly production record from the company's In Situ assets. The increase in non-upgraded bitumen production to market included the impacts of lower bitumen volumes processed at upgrading compared to the prior year quarter. At Fort Hills, production in the first quarter of 2023 was 69,200 bbls/d, compared to 87,500 bbls/d in prior year quarter, reflecting the execution of its mine improvement plan, which is currently on plan. This was partially offset by increased production associated with the company's acquisition of an additional working interest, which was effective February 2, 2023.",
			"E&amp;P production during the first quarter of 2023 was 67,000 boe/d, compared to 80,400 boe/d in the prior year quarter, with the decrease primarily due to natural declines, and asset sales at E&amp;P International.",
			"Refinery crude throughput was 367,700 bbls/d and refinery utilization was 79% in the first quarter of 2023, compared to 436,500 bbls/d and 94% in the prior year quarter, with the decrease primarily due to the completion of repairs and subsequent progressive restart activities at the company's Commerce City refinery, as the asset returned to operations by the end of the quarter. Refinery utilization for the company's Canadian refineries was 94% in the first quarter of 2023, compared to 98% in the prior year quarter. Refined product sales in the first quarter of 2023 were 514,800 bbls/d, compared to 551,900 bbls/d in the prior year quarter, primarily due to the decrease in refinery crude throughput at the company's Commerce City refinery in the current quarter.",
			"\"I have spent some time at our major operating sites over my first few weeks, getting familiar with our operations, our workforce, and understanding our full capabilities,\" said Kruger. \"Our operational performance in the first quarter reinforces the importance of executing the fundamentals of our business and my focus going forward, in addition to safety and operational excellence, will be to maximize the reliability and financial performance of each asset.\"",
			"The company's total operating, selling and general (OS&amp;G) expenses were $3.424 billion in the first quarter of 2023, compared to $3.088 billion in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to increased maintenance costs, including the impacts of repair activities at the company's Commerce City refinery, inflationary impacts, increased mining activity and the company's additional working interest in Fort Hills, partially offset by a decrease in share-based compensation expense. The company's exposure to commodity costs within OS&amp;G are partially mitigated by revenue from power sales that are recorded in operating revenues.",
			"<b>Strategy Update</b>",
			"\"My overriding objective for Suncor is to deliver industry-leading performance. I believe we can achieve this by driving clarity and simplification throughout the organization, and by instilling a laser-like focus on the fundamentals of safety, operational excellence, reliability and profitability,\" said Kruger.",
			"The company continues to progress disciplined decisions to streamline its portfolio, enabling greater fit and focus and allowing the company to allocate resources to its highest value core assets to maximize shareholder returns. On February 2, 2023, Suncor completed the acquisition of an additional 14.65% working interest in Fort Hills for $712 million, bringing the company's and its affiliate's total aggregate working interest in Fort Hills to 68.76%. Subsequent to the first quarter of 2023, Suncor entered into an agreement to purchase TotalEnergies' Canadian operations through the acquisition of TotalEnergies Canada, which holds a 31.23% working interest in Fort Hills, a 50% working interest in Surmont, located in the Fort McMurray region, as well as certain other associated assets. The acquisition is for cash consideration of $5.5 billion, before closing adjustments and other closing costs, with the potential for additional payments of up to an aggregate maximum of $600 million, expiring after five years and conditional upon WCS benchmark pricing and certain production targets. Subject to closing, the transaction will have an effective date of April 1, 2023. The Surmont in situ project is operated by ConocoPhillips Canada, which holds the remaining 50% working interest. Under the terms of the Surmont joint venture arrangements, ConocoPhillips Canada has certain pre-emptive rights including a right of first refusal on the 50% Surmont working interest. Closing of the transaction is anticipated to occur in the third quarter of 2023 and is subject to waiver of the right of first refusal on the Surmont working interest and other customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.",
			"Upon closing, Suncor will be the sole owner and operator of Fort Hills. This transaction, in addition with the previous acquisition of 14.65% interest in Fort Hills from Teck Resources Limited in the first quarter of 2023, adds approximately 163,000 bbls/d of bitumen production capacity to Suncor's portfolio. The additional bitumen production capacity advances the company's long-term bitumen supply strategy for when the company's Base Mine reaches its end of life. With 100% ownership of Fort Hills, Firebag and MacKay River, there is sufficient bitumen supply from the company's regional Oil Sands assets to continue to feed the Base Plant upgraders at full rates post the end of the Base Mine life, which is expected in the mid-2030's. Additionally, the increased production volumes will provide immediate and accretive cash flow for the company.",
			"The company intends to fund the acquisition primarily through debt issuances. As a result, the company plans to maintain its current capital allocation levels, allocating excess funds equally towards debt repayment and share buybacks. Should the acquisition close as contemplated, Suncor's Board of Directors currently intends to increase the quarterly dividend by approximately 10% following transaction close.",
			"In E&amp;P, during the first quarter of 2023, the company reached an agreement for the sale of its U.K. portfolio for gross proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion, including a contingent consideration of approximately $338 million, before closing adjustments and other closing costs. The sale is pending regulatory approval and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023. Also during the first quarter of 2023, the company completed the sale of its wind and solar assets for gross proceeds of $730 million, before closing adjustments and other closing costs, resulting in an after-tax gain on sale of approximately $260 million.",
			"The Terra Nova Floating, Production, Storage and Offloading facility returned to Canada in the first quarter of 2023. The timing of Terra Nova return to production has been delayed as the company has identified additional maintenance and commissioning activities, that are currently ongoing quayside, in order to ensure full confidence in the safety and reliability of the asset before returning to production.",
			"In the downstream, in the first quarter of 2023 the company entered into a co-ownership agreement with North Atlantic, a leading gas station and convenience store operator in Atlantic Canada, to combine retail fuel networks. The combined network has 110 sites in three Atlantic Canadian provinces, and will include the rebranding of a number of North Atlantic's sites to the Petro-Canada™ brand. Additionally, subsequent to the first quarter of 2023, Petro-Canada™ and Canadian Tire Corporation announced a new partnership. The partnership will result in the rebranding of over 200 of Canadian Tire Corporation's retail fuel network sites to the Petro-Canada™ brand, increasing the presence of Petro-Canada's brand across the country. This will include partnering of the two iconic brand's loyalty programs, driving additional value for millions of loyalty members. Suncor will also become the primary fuel provider for Canadian Tire Corporation's retail fuel network over time.",
			"Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is a key component of the company's business strategy and long-term vision, and Suncor continues to work collaboratively with industry peers through the Pathways Alliance and with federal and provincial governments. In the first quarter of 2023, the Pathways Alliance was awarded exploratory rights from the Government of Alberta for the proposed carbon capture and storage hub to safely and permanently store CO<sub>2 </sub>captured from over twenty oil sands facilities in northern Alberta. Also during the first quarter of 2023, an engineering contract was awarded to Wood, a global engineering and consulting company, to develop detailed plans for a 400-kilometre CO<sub>2</sub> transportation line that would eventually link the oil sands facilities with the carbon capture and storage hub. This engineering and field work is expected to support a regulatory application later this year.",
			"<b>Corporate Guidance</b>",
			"Suncor has updated its full-year business environment outlook assumption for AECO-C Spot from $5.00/GJ to $2.50/GJ due to changes in forward curve pricing for the remainder of the year.",
			"In addition, the production range for E&amp;P has been updated from 65,000 bbls/d-75,000 bbls/d to 50,000 bbls/d-60,000 bbls/d, with no change to the company's total production range, reflecting the delay of Terra Nova return to production, as well as the timing of the U.K. divestiture.",
			"For further details and advisories regarding Suncor's 2023 corporate guidance, see <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:www.suncor.com/guidance;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/GOWDvs1VZL\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">www.suncor.com/guidance</a>.",
			"<b>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</b>",
			"Certain financial measures in this news release - namely adjusted funds from operations and adjusted operating earnings and related per share or per barrel amounts - are not prescribed by GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are included because management uses the information to analyze business performance, leverage and liquidity, as applicable, and it may be useful to investors on the same basis.

Except as otherwise indicated, these non-GAAP financial measures are calculated and disclosed on a consistent basis from period to period. Specific adjusting items may only be relevant in certain periods.",
			"<b>Adjusted Operating Earnings</b>",
			"Adjusted operating earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts net earnings for significant items that are not indicative of operating performance. Management uses adjusted operating earnings to evaluate operating performance because management believes it provides better comparability between periods. Adjusted operating earnings is reconciled to net earnings in the news release above.",
			"<b>Adjusted Funds From (Used In) Operations</b>",
			"Adjusted funds from (used in) operations is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts a GAAP measure - cash flow provided by operating activities - for changes in non-cash working capital, which management uses to analyze operating performance and liquidity. Changes to non-cash working capital can be impacted by, among other factors, commodity price volatility, the timing of offshore feedstock purchases and payments for commodity and income taxes, the timing of cash flows related to accounts receivable and accounts payable, and changes in inventory, which management believes reduces comparability between periods.",

			"Warren Buffett, also commonly called the Oracle of Omaha, is a name that jumps to the forefront of many minds when thinking of the financial world.",
			"As we’re all aware, many mimic his portfolio moves.",
			"And just over the weekend, Berkshire Hathaway hosted its annual shareholder meeting, putting the Oracle of Omaha and his go-to man, Charlie Munger, in full focus.",
			"With the legendary investing icon making headlines following the meeting, let’s take a look at three companies that Buffett has placed big bets on.",
			"<strong><u>Apple (</u></strong>AAPL<strong><u>)</u></strong>",
			"Apple is a long-time favorite of Buffett, reflecting the largest holding of Berkshire. Over the weekend, the icon spoke positively about the iPhone’s rock-solid status among consumers, a big reason why he believes in the company.",
			"Apple’s quarterly results took the spotlight last week, with the tech titan delivering a positive 5.6% EPS surprise and reporting revenue nearly 2% above expectations. The company also announced a 4% increase to its quarterly cash dividend, payable on May 18<sup>th</sup>.",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span>",
			"In addition, the company posted solid iPhone results; iPhone revenue throughout the reported quarter totaled $51.3 billion, 4% above the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improving 1.5% from the year-ago period.",
			"As we can see from the chart below, the better-than-expected iPhone results snapped a streak of back-to-back negative surprises.",
			"<strong>Suprise (%) - iPhone Revenue</strong>",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span>",
			"<strong><u>Bank of America (</u></strong>BAC<strong><u>)</u></strong>",
			"Despite the recent turmoil within banking, Buffett still remains optimistic about BAC. The legendary investor is well-known for his purchase of BAC shares back in 2011.",
			"Similar to AAPL, Bank of America posted results that came in nicely above expectations in its latest release, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by nearly 20% and delivering a positive 4.7% revenue surprise.",
			"The market didn’t have a great reaction to the results post-earnings, as we can see by the green arrow in the chart below.",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span>",
			"Still, the company has consistently shown a shareholder-friendly nature, carrying a solid 10.8% five-year annualized dividend growth rate. Currently, BAC shares yield 3.2% annually, well above the Zacks Finance sector average.",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span>",
			"<strong><u>Occidental Petroleum (</u></strong>OXY<strong><u>)</u></strong>",
			"Buffett’s been in the headlines many times over the last year regarding his OXY purchases. At the annual shareholder meeting, the Oracle of Omaha said that there were no plans to fully acquire the company despite the rapid buying of shares.",
			"Keep an eye out for OXY’s upcoming quarterly release expected on May 9<sup>th</sup> after the market’s close; the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $1.30 reflects a pullback of roughly 40% from the year-ago period.",
			"Analysts haven’t been bullish for the quarter to be reported, with the quarterly EPS estimate being revised 15% lower since February of this year.",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span>",
			"A favorable operating environment has allowed OXY to generate substantial cash over the last year, helping it increase its dividend payout by nearly 40% during the period. The company generated $2.4 billion of free cash flow in its latest quarter, down year-over-year but well above pre-pandemic levels.",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span>",
			"<strong><u>Bottom Line</u></strong>",
			"With the Oracle of Omaha making headlines over the weekend following the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting, revisiting some of his favorite holdings is beneficial.",
			"And all three stocks above – Apple AAPL, Bank of America BAC, and Occidental Petroleum OXY – are all examples of companies that the legendary investor has placed sizable bets on.",

			"After immigrating to Canada, in the midst of unpacking and settling into a new life, taking in a ballet performance might seem like an unlikely night out.",

			"\"There are so many benefits of attending and participating in performing arts activities,\" says Janis Galloway, Community Impact Officer at Alberta Ballet. \"You meet new people, are inspired, and learn more about your new community. We know from our agency partners that immigrants look to arts and culture organizations to learn about their new homes, and we want to be a space for that community connection.\"",
			"Tickets for the 2022-23 season, which runs from September until May, have brought Welcoming Newcomers program participants to all sorts of ballet productions, from holiday classics such as The Nutcracker to contemporary performances like Love Rocks, which featured music by R&amp;B and hip-hop artists Lenny Kravitz and Kendrick Lamar.",
			"In May, audiences will enjoy the premier of <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:BOTERO;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://pr.report/LGXbqNEH\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BOTERO</a>, a production from a Colombian-Belgian choreographer that features the iconic characters in the paintings of Colombian artist Fernando Botero.",
			"\"While we'e relieving the financial burden on newcomers who might not otherwise be able to afford a ticket to the ballet during their settlement journey, we're also increasing awareness about the performing arts opportunities here in Alberta,\" says Galloway. \"We're ensuring that they know they're welcome to our theatres, and opening up a collaboration channel that values feedback from diverse Albertans.\"",
			"Enbridge is committed to creating vibrant communities near our operations, by supporting opportunities to be enriched by cultural experiences, and to learn, grow and lead. Our $70,000 Fueling Futures grant to Alberta Ballet allows the dance company to offer about 1,000 tickets for new Canadians to attend performances in Edmonton and Calgary.",
			"\"Enbridge has been one of our most valued supporters,\" says Galloway. \"Our community impact goals align so well, and they have been a reliable partner for decades.\"",
			"Alberta Ballet works with local partners to reach newcomers, gather feedback about their experience in performing arts spaces and distribute tickets. Namely, those partners include Immigrant Services Calgary, the Calgary Immigrant Women's Association, Edmonton Immigrants Services Association, Saranay Filipino-Canadian Association, Action 4 Healthy Communities, and the Institute for Canadian Citizenship Canoo program.",
			"Alberta Ballet also recently launched a new pilot program at its Edmonton and Calgary studios for immigrant youth, which Galloway describes as \"the next evolution\" to the Welcoming Newcomers program.",
			"\"We want to take our impact a step further-from the theatre to our studios, continuing to reduce barriers to participate in dance\" she says.",
			"Everyone is encouraged to check out the ballet season for themselves, but those especially inspired by Alberta Ballet's efforts to support the arts and live dance can <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:contribute directly;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://pr.report/E58Ggym7\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">contribute directly</a> on the website.",
			"\"I get a bit choked up thinking about it, because it's an experience that some of us take for granted, and do not realize what a special experience it is to be able to attend a live dance performance or step into a studio and feel like you belong,\" says Galloway.",
			"\"Our performances are unique-they provide a space where everyone enjoys a shared experience that transcends language barriers.\"",

			"<span><strong>Monday, May 8, 2023</strong><br/><br/>The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Mastercard Incorporated (MA), The Coca-Cola Company (KO) and T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.<br/><br/>You can <strong>see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong><br/><br/><strong>Mastercard</strong> shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+18.0% vs. +10.2%). Company’s numerous acquisitions are helping it to grow addressable markets and drive new revenue streams. We expect the company's top line at $25.2 billion in 2023. The COVID-19 crisis accelerated the adoption of digital and contactless solutions, providing an opportunity for MA's business to expedite its shift to the digital mode.<br/><br/>Mastercard is well-poised to gain from steady cash-generating abilities. A strong capital position allows it to pursue acquisitions and prudently deploy capital.<br/><br/>However, steep operating expenses might stress margins. High rebates and incentives may weigh on the company's net revenues. Its dividend yield is still lower than the industry average. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.<br/><br/>(You can <strong>read the full research report on Mastercard here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br/><br/>Shares of <strong>Coca-Cola</strong> have gained +1.4% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry’s gain of +10.3%. The company’s earnings and sales improved year over year and surpassed the Zacks analyst estimates in the quarter. KO’s results benefited from the continued momentum in its business.<br/><br/>Sales gained from revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and a rise in concentrate sales. It is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments. It provided an upbeat guidance for 2023.<br/><br/>However, shares of Coca-Cola lagged the industry in the past three months. Pressures from higher supply chain costs, higher marketing spends and currency headwinds are concerning.<br/><br/>(You can <strong>read the full research report on Coca-Cola here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br/><br/>Shares of <strong>T-Mobile US</strong> have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+18.0% vs. -4.8%). With industry-leading growth in postpaid and broadband customers driven by superior 5G network and focus on customers, T-Mobile reported solid first-quarter 2023 results driven by diligent execution of operational plans.<br/><br/>The company has augmented its 5G footprint by introducing 5G Home Internet services in several states. T-Mobile plans to reach 300 million people within 2023. It intends to bring more competition to home broadband, especially in underserved rural markets.<br/><br/>However, T-Mobile operates in a fiercely competitive and almost saturated U.S. telecom market, which lowers its growth potential to some extent. Several promotional activities to lure additional customers are further eroding profitability. Lower equipment revenues due to a challenging macroeconomic environment remain a concern. Debt obligation woes also persist.<br/><br/>(You can <strong>read the full research report on T-Mobile US here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br/><br/>Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Shopify Inc. (SHOP), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC) and EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG).<br/><br/>Director of Research<br/><br/>Sheraz Mian<br/><br/><em>Note: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

The outperformance could be attributed to higher volumes and retail fuel contribution.<br/><br/>However, MUSA’s bottom line was significantly below the year-earlier quarter’s adjusted profit of $6.08 per share, dragged down by a fall in the retail gasoline price.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Murphy USA’s operating revenues of $5.1 billion edged down 0.8% year over year but breezed past the consensus mark by $118 million, primarily due to improved merchandise sales.<br/><br/>Merchandise sales, at $966.2 million, rose 8.3% year over year and outperformed the consensus mark of $887 million. However, revenues from petroleum product sales came in at $4 billion, falling 3.4% short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declining 3.7% from the first quarter of 2022.<br/>",

On a bearish note, total fuel contribution (including retail fuel margin plus product supply and wholesale results) came in at 28.9 cents per gallon, which dropped 15% from the first quarter of 2022.<br/><br/>Retail fuel contribution increased 4.4% year over year to $264.7 million even as margins, at 23.2 cents per gallon, remained essentially unchanged from the corresponding period of 2022. Retail gallons rose 4.9% from the year-ago period to 1,141.8 million in the quarter under review but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 1,147 million. Volumes on an SSS basis (or fuel gallons per store) improved 2.2% from the first quarter of 2022 to 227.8 thousand. Meanwhile, the average retail gasoline price during the quarter came in at $3.15 per gallon, down from $3.43 per gallon a year ago.<br/><br/>Contribution from Merchandise increased 6.5% to $187.1 million on higher sales, which more than offset the fall in unit margins, from 19.7% a year ago to 19.4% in the first quarter of 2023. On an SSS basis, total merchandise contribution was up 5% year over year, primarily on the back of 5.6% higher non-tobacco margins. Meanwhile, merchandise sales increased 6% on an SSS basis due to an increase in tobacco as well as non-tobacco sales.<br/><br/>The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s monthly fuel gallons were up 2.4% from the prior-year period, while merchandise sales increased 6% on an average per store month basis.<br/><br/>You can see <strong>the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.",
			"As of Dec 31, Murphy USA — which opened eight new retail locations in the quarter to take its store count to 1,720 — had cash and cash equivalents of $102.1 million and long-term debt (including lease obligations) of $1.8 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 71.4%.<br/><br/>During the quarter, MUSA bought back shares worth $13.7 million.",
			"While we have discussed MUSA’s fourth-quarter results in detail, let’s see how some other refining companies have fared this earnings season.<br/><br/><strong>Phillips 66</strong> PSX reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.21, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.58. Moreover, the bottom line improved significantly from a profit of $1.32 per share in the year-ago quarter.<br/><br/>PSX’s worldwide margins almost doubled to $20.72 per barrel from the year-ago quarter’s $10.83. The same in the Central Corridor and Atlantic Basin/Europe increased to $26.86 and $16.13 per barrel from the year-ago levels of $7.89 and $11.71, respectively. In the Gulf Coast, the metric registered an improvement to $21.28 per barrel from $8.59 in the prior-year quarter. However, the West Coast witnessed a decline in margins from $17.74 per barrel in the year-ago quarter to $16.53 in the March-end quarter of 2023.<br/><br/>Another refining giant, <strong>Valero Energy</strong> VLO, also reported strong first-quarter earnings. The bottom line of $8.27 per share came in well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.24. The outperformance reflects increased refinery throughput volumes and a higher refining margin. In particular, adjusted operating income in the Refining unit amounted to $4.1 billion, surging from $1.5 billion in the year-ago quarter.<br/><br/>At the end of the first quarter, VLO had cash and cash equivalents of $5.5 billion, while the company’s total debt and finance lease obligations amounted to $11.4 billion. Valero’s first-quarter capital investment was $524 million. Of the total, $341 million was allotted for sustaining the business.<br/><br/>Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.<br/><br/>",

			"<b>Energy Transfer LP</b> (ET) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.",
			"Over the past month, shares of this energy-related services provider have returned -1.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Production Pipeline - MLB industry, which Energy Transfer LP falls in, has lost 0.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?",
			"Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.",
			"<b>Earnings Estimate Revisions</b>",
			"Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.",
			"Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.",
			"For the current quarter, Energy Transfer LP is expected to post earnings of $0.33 per share, indicating a change of -15.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.8% over the last 30 days.",
			"For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.34 points to a change of -5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -6%.",
			"For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.35 indicates a change of +0.5% from what Energy Transfer LP is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.1%.",
			"Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Energy Transfer LP is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).",
			"The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:",
			"<b>12 Month EPS</b>",
			"<b>Revenue Growth Forecast</b>",
			"Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.",
			"For Energy Transfer LP, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $23.49 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -9.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $99.37 billion and $99.57 billion estimates indicate +10.6% and +0.2% changes, respectively.",
			"<b>Last Reported Results and Surprise History</b>",
			"Energy Transfer LP reported revenues of $19 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -7.3%. EPS of $0.32 for the same period compares with $0.37 a year ago.",
			"Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.94 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -20.67%. The EPS surprise was -3.03%.",
			"Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.",
			"<b>Valuation</b>",
			"No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.",
			"Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.",
			"The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.",
			"Energy Transfer LP is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.",
			"<b>Bottom Line</b>",
			"The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Energy Transfer LP. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.",

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, Costco Wholesale Corp. COST, Activision Blizzard, Inc. ATVI, Biogen Inc. BIIB and Arista Networks, Inc. ANET",
			"<strong>Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:</strong>",
			"<strong><em>Top Analyst Reports for Exxon Mobil, Costco and Activision Blizzard</em></strong>",
			"The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Exxon Mobil Corp, Costco Wholesale Corp., and Activision Blizzard, Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.",
			"You can <strong>see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>",
			"<strong>Exxon Mobil </strong>shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+15.6% vs. +3.5%) on the back of the company's bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure that has historically produced industry-leading returns make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play.",
			"The firm has made more than 30 discoveries in offshore Guyana since 2015. ExxonMobil also has a strong presence in the prolific Permian Basin, where it delivered record production in 2022. Also, a strong presence in chemicals and refining operations is noteworthy.",
			"However, ExxonMobil has constantly been bearing the brunt of increasing costs, adversely affecting its income. Also, the company's financials were weakened by years-long significant spending on low-return developments and the pandemic.",
			"(You can <strong>read the full research report on Exxon Mobil here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)",
			"Shares of <strong>Costco</strong> have declined -2.6% over the past year against the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry's decline of -4.5%. The Zacks analyst, however, believes that the company being a consumer defensive stock, has been surviving the market turmoil pretty well. The discount retailer's key strengths are strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives, and an emphasis on membership growth.",
			"Its business can navigate the ongoing inflationary environment and supply chain bottlenecks on several fronts. A favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing power, and strong liquidity position should help Costco.",
			"(You can <strong>read the full research report on Costco here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)",
			"<strong>Activision Blizzard</strong> shares have outperformed the Zacks Toys - Games - Hobbies industry over the past six months (+5.0% vs. +1.6%), though the stock has lost ground lately following unfavorable regulatory action on its Microsoft deal out of the U.K.",
			"Activision's first-quarter 2023 earnings and revenues increased year-over-year. First-quarter growth was broad-based, with net bookings increasing year-over-year in Call of Duty, Candy Crush, Warcraft, Overwatch, and Diablo. Call of Duty in-game net bookings on console and PC grew strongly year-over-year in the first quarter.",
			"The Zacks analyst believes that Diablo Immortal on mobile and PC also contributed to Blizzard's first-quarter net bookings growth. Candy Crush payer numbers again grew year-over-year, and Candy Crush was the top-grossing game franchise in the U.S. app stores for the 23rd quarter in a row.",

			"For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.",
			"In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like <strong>Pioneer Natural Resources</strong> (<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:NYSE:PXD;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-pxd/pioneer-natural-resources?blueprint=2499939&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=intro&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NYSE:PXD</a>), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.",

			"Over the last three years, Pioneer Natural Resources has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. In impressive fashion, Pioneer Natural Resources' EPS grew from US$17.36 to US$30.14, over the previous 12 months. Year on year growth of 74% is certainly a sight to behold.",
			"One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Pioneer Natural Resources shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 31% to 40%, and revenue is growing. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.",

			"Since Pioneer Natural Resources has a market capitalisation of US$50b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$319m. This comes in at 0.6% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.",
			"Pioneer Natural Resources' earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here.

			"A big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Prior to this announcement, the company was paying out 290% of what it was earning. Without profits and cash flows increasing, it would be difficult for the company to continue paying the dividend at this level.",
			"The next 12 months is set to see EPS grow by 181.0%. However, if the dividend continues along recent trends, it could start putting pressure on the balance sheet with the payout ratio reaching 114% over the next year.",
			"The company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of CA$1.13 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of CA$3.55. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 12% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.",
			"Some investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. Enbridge has seen earnings per share falling at 3.5% per year over the last five years. A modest decline in earnings isn't great, and it makes it quite unlikely that the dividend will grow in the future unless that trend can be reversed. Earnings are forecast to grow over the next 12 months and if that happens we could still be a little bit cautious until it becomes a pattern.",
			"Overall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Enbridge will make a great income stock. Although they have been consistent in the past, we think the payments are a little high to be sustained. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.",
			"Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Therefore, if you purchase Enbridge's shares on or after the 12th of May, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 1st of June.",
			"The company's next dividend payment will be CA$0.89 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of CA$3.55 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Enbridge has a trailing yield of 6.6% on the current share price of CA$53.43. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether Enbridge can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.",
			"<span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:See our latest analysis for Enbridge;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/energy/tsx-enb/enbridge-shares?blueprint=2498412&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Enbridge </a></span>",
			"Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Last year, Enbridge paid out 290% of its profit to shareholders in the form of dividends. This is not sustainable behaviour and requires a closer look on behalf of the purchaser. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out 102% of its free cash flow in the form of dividends last year, which is outside the comfort zone for most businesses. Cash flows are usually much more volatile than earnings, so this could be a temporary effect - but we'd generally want to look more closely here.",
			"Cash is slightly more important than profit from a dividend perspective, but given Enbridge's payments were not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we are concerned about the sustainability of this dividend.",

			"Companies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. Readers will understand then, why we're concerned to see Enbridge's earnings per share have dropped 6.5% a year over the past five years. Such a sharp decline casts doubt on the future sustainability of the dividend.",
			"Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Enbridge has delivered an average of 12% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. That's intriguing, but the combination of growing dividends despite declining earnings can typically only be achieved by paying out a larger percentage of profits. Enbridge is already paying out a high percentage of its income, so without earnings growth, we're doubtful of whether this dividend will grow much in the future.",
			"Should investors buy Enbridge for the upcoming dividend? Not only are earnings per share declining, but Enbridge is paying out an uncomfortably high percentage of both its earnings and cashflow to shareholders as dividends. Unless there are grounds to believe a turnaround is imminent, this is one of the least attractive dividend stocks under this analysis. Bottom line: Enbridge has some unfortunate characteristics that we think could lead to sub-optimal outcomes for dividend investors.",
			"With that in mind though, if the poor dividend characteristics of Enbridge don't faze you, it's worth being mindful of the risks involved with this business. Our analysis shows <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:4 warning signs for Enbridge;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/energy/tsx-enb/enbridge-shares?blueprint=2498412&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=conclusion&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>4 warning signs for Enbridge</strong></a> that we strongly recommend you have a look at before investing in the company.",

			"Impressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Before this announcement, TC Energy was paying out 229% of what it was earning, and not generating any free cash flows either. Paying out such a large dividend compared to earnings while also not generating any free cash flow would definitely be difficult to keep up.",
			"Earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe we could see the payout ratio reaching 83%, which is definitely on the higher side, but still sustainable.",
			"The company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The annual payment during the last 10 years was CA$1.76 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was CA$3.72. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 7.8% a year over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.",
			"Investors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. TC Energy's EPS has fallen by approximately 15% per year during the past five years. Such rapid declines definitely have the potential to constrain dividend payments if the trend continues into the future. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited.",
			"Overall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. Although they have been consistent in the past, we think the payments are a little high to be sustained. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.",
			"Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one.

			"Schlumberger has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. In impressive fashion, Schlumberger's EPS grew from US$1.49 to US$2.71, over the previous 12 months. It's a rarity to see 82% year-on-year growth like that. That could be a sign that the business has reached a true inflection point.",
			"It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. The good news is that Schlumberger is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 2.9 percentage points to 15%, over the last year. That's great to see, on both counts.",

			"SYDNEY, May 7 (Reuters) - Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers urged minor political parties on Sunday to back proposed changes to the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT) paid by the offshore LNG industry, as the industry's lobby group welcomed the move.",
			"The government estimates the changes, which would hike tax paid by the industry, will lift revenue by A$2.4 billion ($1.6 billion) over the next four fiscal years.",
			"It comes as Australia, which has 10 LNG plants run by companies including Woodside, Chevron Corp, Santos Ltd , Japan's Inpex Corp, ConocoPhillips and Shell, vies with Qatar and the United States as top global LNG supplier.",
			"Asked about potential opposition to the PRRT changes from minor party senators, Chalmers told Sky News television: \"I’d encourage the parliament to support this\".",
			"The Labor government will need the support of minor parties in the Senate, where it is in a minority, to push the reform through.",
			"Speaking ahead of Tuesday's 2023/24 federal budget release, Chalmers said the changes balanced getting \"more revenue sooner to fund our cost of living package\" while protecting \"investment, and supply, and our international relationships\".",
			"Under the changes, the government will adopt most recommendations of a Treasury review - initiated by the previous conservative government - of gas transfer pricing rules, including limiting how much PRRT assessable income on LNG projects can be offset by deductions to 90%, from July 1.",
			"It also plans to equalise treatment of notional upstream and downstream entities so losses will be split evenly rather that attributed entirely to the upstream entity.",
			"Australia's gas industry lobby group, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, said in a statement that the proposals accounted for the \"undeniable need\" for a strong gas sector and \"a more sustainable national budget\".",
			"However, the chief executive of Woodside Energy Group urged the government last month not to change the tax, saying \"over-reaching\" on tax reform could undercut future revenue and hamper investment needed to boost supply.",
			"A spokesperson for Woodside was not immediately available for comment on the proposed changes announced on Saturday. (Reporting by Sam McKeith; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)"

			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Welcome to Yahoo Finance's special coverage of the 2023 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting, known as the Woodstock of capitalism. And it's among the biggest events of the year for investors. We'll hear from legendary investor and Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett, along with his Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, as they give us their unique take on what's been a complicated year for the markets.",
			"A banking crisis, a slowing economy, geopolitical tensions, accelerated digital transformation with AI and a lot more, it's all on the agenda today. We're breaking down the big news from today's meeting and what's happening to the markets and your money.",
			"Brian Sozzi of Yahoo Finance here with Yahoo Finance's head of news, Myles Udland. And Myles and I, along with all of these people, are streaming out of the CHI Health Center in Omaha, Nebraska, have been ingesting hours and hours of Warren Buffett's insights into the economy and stocks alongside his right-hand man, Vice Chair Charlie Munger. And of course, we have a lot of takeaways.",
			"But let's start with three from this really celebration of capitalism, as those Berkshire shareholders love to call it. First off, the big banks, everybody in this room was waiting, Myles, to hear from Buffett on his views on the banks. Of course, First Republic now owned by JP Morgan, Buffett really not disappointing. Out of all the bank stocks that he talked about and the sector itself, he said he liked Bank of America, which he owns 13% of.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, well, so he came through his prepared remarks, which he said will be brief. They ran about 18 minutes, which I guess for Buffett--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> That's brief.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> --counts as brief. And we kind of got right into it with the regional banks. And really the question was, what would have happened had the deposits of Silicon Valley Bank not been insured, and ultimately Buffett going with what I think most people would have expected him to say, where he said it would have been catastrophic.",
			"And I think, you know, Sozzi, it brings me back to that weekend where the bank is seized by regulators Friday morning. And everyone's thinking what's going to happen over the weekend. Ultimately FDIC comes out. They say we're going to backstop these.",
			"And throughout the proceedings there were a couple of questions in this direction. And I think Buffett's takeaway is that effectively all deposits in the US are now backstopped.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> That's good.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Whether they say that or not.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> That's good. And that, of course, as well, Myles, as well, but come Monday morning's open for the market--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> I didn't get the sense that Buffett signaled to the world, go out and buy bank stocks. He sounded like many other people are, yeah, they might do this. They might do that. But I didn't hear that same tone compared to what I heard from Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, a couple of days at Milken, where she said things are stable. I just didn't get that vibe.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, I mean, we'll get to it in a little bit with his comments on Bank of America in more detail. But he did say that if you are an investor in banks right now or a prospective investor, I think he said, if you're a bank shareholder to use his phrase exactly, kind of hard to know what you buy, or what you're owning I guess in that situation. And a lot of it for him has to go with what are deposits.",
			"And he mentioned how sticky are deposits now, because did the whole wind-up. You don't have to stand in line to take him out of a bank. You can just go on your phone and pull your money. Obviously a dynamic that we saw with the Fed's report and the FDIC's report a couple of weeks ago is what happened at Silicon Valley Bank.",
			"What has been happening in the sector is people are wondering who is next. But really I think from Buffett's view, there's just a perception right now that you do not know for sure for sure what the business of a bank exactly looks like.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> And, you know, you mentioned Bank of America, Myles, and you're a student of Warren Buffett and this meeting, been coming to it for many years. I can't say I'm surprised that he called out Bank of America. Of course he owns 13% of it. But under CEO Brian Moynihan, they aren't necessarily out there taking these crazy risks that a lot of these other regional banks are. So a different company, but again, Buffett, being Buffett, suggesting that Bank of America is doing something right in this climate.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, and ultimately I think his takeaway was, well, I bought the thing back in 2011. He puts a bunch of capital in it. And I guess I'm going to see that through 12 years later.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Yep, absolutely. All right, well, outside the bank, of course, another takeaway we have is AI. So everybody was focused on what Buffett and Munger had to say on banks, but also artificial intelligence. And again, I'm going back. I'm thinking through the stock action on Monday. I just don't think these AI stocks, which have been really hot, come out blasting off of what Warren Buffett said out of the gate here.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> I mean sure, if you're trying to play the AI stocks--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> I'm trying to, I'm trying.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Based on what Warren Buffett is going to do, I mean, I don't really know if I can help you with that. But I think that the AI interaction there, and that was, I think, question two, three, four. It was right up there on the proceedings. It really got us our first great Mungerism of the day, when you're talking about what's the power of AI, this, that, and the other. And of course Charlie hits us with, well, I think old fashioned intelligence works just fine. We don't need the artificial stuff.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> There's nothing wrong with that.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> The good old fashioned intelligence is just fine in his view.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> But it is interesting that they view AI, they first went to BYD robots. Of course BYD is that electric car company. That's their first interpretation of what AI is, not Microsoft.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Buffett and that Bill Gates relationship, not what they're doing, robots making cars.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> And I think that the reason that people come to this event, and the reason that Warren and Charlie have an audience, is because they are representative in a lot of ways of the median investor's view on this. And sure, you talked a lot of people who get really excited about language learning models and all these kinds of AGI, right? It's not just AI. It's artificial general intelligence.",
			"And they're just like, I mean, we have robots, you know. Robots are fine. And also in this section, too, I think it's the first time of many times where we got to what if he references to nuclear weapons.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Yes.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> And the technology--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Which he always does, which he does in the past.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Is a regular feature of these. But I think that the risk of-- like the nuclear risk to Buffett is sort of the go to zero risk. And obviously in the '60s, very formative time in his career, and it's something that he brings up quite a bit.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> So bottom line with that takeaway, folks, is if you were looking for Warren Buffett to pitch shares of C3AI, not going to happen. Next take away, of course, value investing. That's why a lot of people that I've talked to at this event, that's why they come here, to get a sense of what Warren Buffett sees in terms of value. And it was interesting what he said on value investing, Myles.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, and, you know, I think this is where we saw the biggest distance between Warren and Charlie. Charlie Munger, very pessimistic on it, he said, I just think it's going to be worse in the future. And Buffett coming back and saying, well, you know, Charlie, you always say that.",
			"And I think that to use Munger's exact quote, my advice to value investors is get used to making less money. And you see the folks kind of behind us here certainly this morning teeming into the building, you know, people in sport coats and khakis, value types. I overheard quite a few conversations on my way in to that effect.",
			"And they weren't just trying to give some encouragement to the crowd. And this is where we kind of got to a Warren zinger, perhaps, where your biggest opportunity as an investor, value or otherwise, is other people doing dumb things.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Yeah, a lot of folks mistaking me for a hedge fund manager at this event. I also point out--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Well, you're dressed like one.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> I know.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> I'm dressed like a normal person. You're dressed like a hedge fund manager.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> I know. Well, I also, on value investing, I caught up with Whitney Tilson, longtime Buffett follower and friend of our shows. He said based on his models, he said this after the event, he calculates that Berkshire is trading at a 13% discount to intrinsic value. So if value investing is really dead, what do you do with Berkshire stock if it is that undervalued?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, well, what did Warren say? $504 billion on a GAAP basis is what the stock is worth? And you kind of, or I think it's $504,000 per share. You do the quick and dirty math on that, divided by the 1,500, you get 333 for B shares, and I think they closed around 320 on Friday.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> All right.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> So, I mean, Whitney always-- I've been in many presentations at this event with Whitney telling me that I should be buying Berkshire Hathaway. So I don't think you're going to get a different answer from him at other points in time.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Fair enough. All right, of course, we have a rapid-fire section for you as well, hitting a lot of these favorite Yahoo Finance tickers. First off Apple, of course, Apple is a key holder, a key holding inside of Berkshire Hathaway. And Myles, naturally, it took a little while to get that Apple question. But it was interesting how it was posed to him.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> It did, and we kind of got to it in two ways. I think what'll draw the headlines is Buffett saying, you know, I don't understand the product at all, or I don't understand the phone. But I understand the business. He understands the business of selling phones, not necessarily how one makes a phone.",
			"But that also got into really what I think Apple has become the most instructive holding within Berkshire's portfolio. They pay a huge dividend. So every quarter, they're getting hundreds of millions-- they're getting $100 million check, or it's not, it's much larger than that. But nine figure check coming to Berkshire Hathaway.",
			"Second thing, they buy back a lot of stock. So Berkshire's holdings in Apple, its percentage of the company that it owns, has gone up organically over time. We saw the announcement on Thursday night from Apple increasing the size of that buyback authorization.",
			"So it's going to continue to go up. And it led to this discussion of how much Apple do you really own. And you look at the equity portfolio, it's out 40%. And Buffett was like, it's not 40%. We own a bunch of other stuff, See's Candies, Garanimals, got tons of runs in a kid's clothing brand. Tons of run today. But basically being like we're not 35% Apple, because our equity holdings are only a small chunk of the whole Berkshire family.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> You look at Apple and you have to think, is this the new Coca-Cola for this generation in terms of an investment for Warren Buffett. Is this Warren Buffett connecting with that next generation of investors?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> I mean, I think, look, you can kind of say, and Buffett would probably say this, doesn't really matter what the product is. They have a dominant position in the market. They make a ton of money. They return a bunch of that money to shareholders.",
			"So whether you're selling Coca-Cola or you're selling iPhones, it hits all those criteria. And whatever generation you want to call any company, any company coming from, Buffett's going to like those characteristics.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Next up rapid-fire session here, Paramount. Of course, on Friday the stock got absolutely slaughtered, slashing its dividend, bad quarter, lots of losses. And one thing that stuck with me from that quarter from Paramount, Myles, when I talked to Amex's CEO, Stephen Squeri, that story is on our homepage now. He says do not surprise Warren Buffett.",
			"To me he sounded surprised this event. He did not come out and say, you know, Bob Bakish is a phenomenal manager. Of course that's the CEO of Paramount. He didn't do it. He didn't do it.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Well, we just talked about how Warren Buffett likes companies that return a lot of capital to shareholders. What did Paramount come out and do on Thursday? They cut their dividend. And Buffett says never good when a company announces a material cut to their dividend.",
			"You're trying to shore up your capital position. You can't give it back to your owners basically. So I'll be interested to see what happens with that position. It kind of is a small part of the Berkshire equity portfolio, kind of came up-- I won't say out of nowhere, he has a long history investing in the media business, but all of a sudden it's a bunch of Paramount. Now he owns 93 million shares of the company.",
			"And so we get into the conversation about the streaming wars. And I thought his comments on your eyeballs were quite hilarious.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Yeah, eyeballs matter, but in that--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> He goes everyone loves to use their eyes.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> No, yes, and that's key, he's clearly bullish eyes. But in that context, there's a lot of competition for our eyeballs, which is why I think that stake in Paramount disclosed in November last year raised a lot of eyebrows, because it wasn't really Warren Buffetty.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> I think everyone thinks the same thing, and, you know, look, the 13F will come out, I guess what, middle of next week, what they did or didn't do in the first quarter. So I think some questions there with that position.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> We're keeping it moving here, Taiwan Semiconductor, a position that Buffett took, what was it, late last year. And then he exited very quickly, not a very Warren Buffett type of move. But he did heap a lot of praise on that company.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, I mean, I'll kick this one right back to you, because you wrote up a quick story for us on this one. He heaped a lot of praise on it. And he kind of had a weird-- I don't know, I couldn't make sense of exactly what the point was on not wanting exposure to Taiwan, but saying US-China relations might be fine. Everyone has blame. I couldn't quite sort that one out.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Yeah, and if you're an Intel and you're a lot of these other chip-makers, to not hear Warren Buffett say you're doing cool stuff, not exactly a great thing. Lastly, Occidental Petroleum. Of course, a lot of investors, Warren Buffett built its position or his position in Occidental Petroleum under the potential, maybe goes out and just buys the darn company. But Warren said, eh-eh, unlikely to happen.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> He was very blunt. We are not going to make a play to take control of the company. They have approval to buy up to 50% of the outstanding shares. I think they own about 25% today. But, yeah, there was an analyst that talked to our RNS friend Josh Schafer last week who surmised maybe Vicki Hollub, CEO, would come in and run Berkshire Hathaway Energy when Greg Abel moves on. I mean, maybe that could happen.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Ooh, that's good.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, it was a good one in the story. But Buffett kind of squashing that today.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> And then final takeaways, Myles, to you. You first.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Really crowded, man, this place is crowded. This place yesterday, extremely stressful going in the Convention Hall.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> For me, two takeaways, one amazing to see Warren Buffett, 92 years old, Charlie Munger 99 years old, answering all these questions in top form. I'm just fascinated by the whole thing. And the next, last but not least, on Monday, the \"Morning Brief\" newsletter, please do check that out, subscribe, whatever. We're looking into the succession battle, or not battle, or succession plan here for Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway. Lots of interesting nuggets that our team pulled here from the event.",
			"But that's it for yours truly and Myles Udland. And we're going to get back and get some air conditioning. It's a little warm here in Omaha, Nebraska. We'll see you guys later."

			"To me, he sounded surprised at this event. He did not come out and say, Bob Bakish is a phenomenal manager. Of course, that's the CEO of Paramount. He didn't do it. He didn't do it.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Well, we just talked about how Warren Buffett likes companies that return a lot of capital to shareholders. What did Paramount come out and do on Thursday? They cut their dividend. And Buffett says, never good when a company announces a material cut to their dividend. You're trying to shore up your capital position when you can't give it back to your owners basically.",
			"So I'll be interested to see what happens with that position. It kind of-- it's a small part of the Berkshire equity portfolio. It kind of came up-- I don't want to say out of nowhere. He has a long history of investing in the media business. But all of a sudden, it's like, oh, Buffett owns a bunch of Paramount. Now he owns 93 million shares of the company.",
			"And so we get into the conversation about the streaming wars. And I thought his comments on your eyeballs were quite hilarious.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Yeah, eyeballs matter. But in that--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> He goes, everyone loves to use their eyes.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> No, yes. It's key. He's clearly bullish eyes. But in that context, there's a lot of competition for our eyeballs, which is why I think that stake in Paramount, disclosed in November last year, raised a lot of eyebrows because it wasn't really Warren Buffetty.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> I think everyone thinks the same thing. And look, the 13-F will come out, I guess, what, middle of next week, what they did or didn't do in the first quarter. So I think some questions there with that position.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> We're keeping moving here, Taiwan Semiconductor a position that Buffett took-- what was it, late last year? And then he exited it very quickly, not a very Warren Buffett type of move. But he did hear a lot of praise on that company.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, I mean, I'll kick this one right back to you because you wrote up a quick story for us on this one. He heaped a lot of praise on it. And he kind of had a-- I don't know. I couldn't make sense of exactly what the point was on not wanting exposure to Taiwan but saying US-China relations might be fine. Everyone has blame. I couldn't quite sort that one out.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Yeah. And if you're an Intel and you're a lot of these other chip-makers, to not hear Warren Buffett say you're doing cool stuff, eh, not exactly a great thing.",
			"Lastly, Occidental Petroleum, of course, a lot of investors have been watching Warren Buffett build its position or his position in Occidental Petroleum under the potential, maybe he goes out and just buys the darn company. But Warren said, eh, eh, eh, unlikely to happen.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> He came-- he was very blunt. We were not going to make a play to take control of the company. They have approval to buy up to 50% of the outstanding shares. I think they own about 25% today. But yeah, there was an analyst that talked to our Ines Ferre and Josh Shafer last week who surmised maybe Vicki Hollub, CEO, would come in and run Berkshire Hathaway Energy when Greg Abel moves on. I mean, maybe that could happen.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Ooh, that's good.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, it was a good one in the story. But Buffett kind of squashing that today.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> And then final takeaways. Myles, to you first.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Really crowded. Man, this place is crowded. Yesterday, extremely stressful going in the convention hall.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> For me, two takeaways. One, amazing to see Warren Buffett, 92 years old, Charlie Munger, 99 old, answering all these questions, in top form. I'm just fascinated by the whole thing. And the next, last but not least, on Monday, \"the Morning Brief\" newsletter, please do check that out, subscribe, whatever. We're looking into the succession battle-- not battle, succession plan here for Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway, lots of interesting little nuggets that our team pulled here from the event.",
			"But that's it for yours truly and Myles Udland. We're going to get back and get some air conditioning. It's a little warm here in Omaha, Nebraska. We'll see you guys later."

We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!",
			"Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Simply Wall St analysis model;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://github.com/SimplyWallSt/Company-Analysis-Model/blob/master/MODEL.markdown#discounted-cash-flow-dcf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Simply Wall St analysis model</a>.",

			"We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.",
			"A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:",
			"<i>(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)</i><br/><strong>Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF)</strong> = US$39b",
			"After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 11%.",
			"<strong>Terminal Value (TV)</strong>= FCF<sub>2032</sub> × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.7b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (11%– 2.1%) = US$64b",
			"<strong>Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)</strong>= TV / (1 + r)<sup>10</sup>= US$64b÷ ( 1 + 11%)<sup>10</sup>= US$22b",
			"The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$61b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$107, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 26% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.",
			"We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Marathon Petroleum as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.520. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.",
			"<strong>Strength</strong>",
			"<strong>Weakness</strong>",
			"<strong>Opportunity</strong>",
			"<strong>Threat</strong>",
			"Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Marathon Petroleum, we've put together three important items you should assess:",

			"Berkshire also sped up repurchases of its own stock, buying back $4.4 billion, while paring its investments in other stocks such as Chevron Corp, which is still a major holding.",
			"Results were released ahead of Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, part of a weekend that draws tens of thousands of people to the city.",
			"Buffett, 92, has run Berkshire since 1965, transforming it from a struggling textile company into a conglomerate with dozens of businesses including Geico, the BNSF railroad, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and manufacturing and retail units including See's Candies and Dairy Queen ice cream.",
			"The diversification has led many investors, not just Buffett fans, to view Berkshire as a stable long-term investment even amid recession fears and concerns about the banking industry.",
			"Net income equaled $24,377 per Class A share and rose from $5.58 billion, or $3,784 per share, a year earlier.",
			"That in part reflected a 27% jump in Apple's stock price, leaving Berkshire with a $151 billion stake in the iPhone maker.",
			"An accounting rule requires Berkshire to report unrealized gains and losses with net results, and Buffett urges investors to ignore the resulting volatility.",
			"Quarterly operating profit increased 13% to $8.07 billion, or about $5,561 per Class A share, from $7.16 billion.",
			"Those results benefited from Geico snapping a six-quarter string of underwriting losses, and a 68% increase in how much Berkshire's insurance units generate from investments.",
			"Geico's pretax underwriting gain was $703 million, benefiting from higher premiums, fewer crashes and a significant drop in ad spending, which may have led to fewer high-risk drivers seeking coverage.",
			"Berkshire's cash hoard grew $2 billion in the quarter to $130.6 billion, as the company sold $13.3 billion of stocks and bought just $2.9 billion.",
			"Chevron appears to have been among the sales, with Berkshire's stake falling 28% to $21.6 billion though the oil company's stock price dropped just 9%.",
			"Berkshire also owns a 23.6% stake in another oil company, Occidental Petroleum Corp.",
			"Its stock sales more than offset the $8.2 billion Berkshire spent to boost its stake in truck stop operator Pilot Travel Centers to 80% from 38.6%, leaving the founding Haslam family with 20%. The increase was expected.",
			"Profit at the BNSF railroad fell 9% to $1.25 billion, hurt by higher fuel costs and lower shipping volumes.",
			"Berkshire Hathaway Energy, normally a steady earnings generator, saw profit fall 46% as it set aside $359 million for legal and other costs from wildfires in Oregon and northern California, where it has multiple operations, in 2020.",
			"Operating results also reflected October's purchase of insurance holding company Alleghany Corp, while net results included a gain related to Pilot.",
			"Berkshire's Class A shares have risen 4.9% this year, trailing the Standard &amp; Poor's 500's 7.7% gain. The index lagged Berkshire by 23.4 percentage points in 2022, excluding dividends. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in Omaha, Nebraska; Editing by Alexander Smith and Diane Craft)"

The early response was not positive, with shares down 5.6% to US$93.44 in the past week. Revenues were US$35b, approximately in line with expectations, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) performed substantially better. EPS of US$4.20 were also better than expected, beating analyst predictions by 18%. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year.",
			"<span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:View our latest analysis for Phillips 66;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-psx/phillips-66?blueprint=2496826&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> View our latest analysis for Phillips 66 </a></span>",
			"After the latest results, the consensus from Phillips 66's eleven analysts is for revenues of US$144.9b in 2023, which would reflect a definite 14% decline in sales compared to the last year of performance. Statutory earnings per share are forecast to tumble 47% to US$14.41 in the same period. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$146.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$15.01 in 2023. So it looks like there's been a small decline in overall sentiment after the recent results - there's been no major change to revenue estimates, but the analysts did make a small dip in their earnings per share forecasts.",
			"The consensus price target held steady at US$124, with the analysts seemingly voting that their lower forecast earnings are not expected to lead to a lower stock price in the foreseeable future. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. There are some variant perceptions on Phillips 66, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$141 and the most bearish at US$101 per share. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Phillips 66 shareholders.",
			"Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:industry;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/us/energy/oil-gas?blueprint=2496826&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=industry&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a> growth estimates. We would highlight that sales are expected to reverse, with a forecast 18% annualised revenue decline to the end of 2023. That is a notable change from historical growth of 9.1% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the industry are forecast to see their revenue decline 3.7% annually for the foreseeable future. So it's pretty clear that Phillips 66's revenues are expected to shrink faster than the wider industry.",
			"The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. They also made no changes to their revenue estimates, implying the business is not expected to experience any major impacts to the sales trajectory in the near term, even though sales are expected to trail the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.",
			"Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.

Here is Ezra.",
			"<strong>Ezra Y. Yacob</strong>",
			"Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Strong first quarter execution from every operating team across our multi-basin portfolio has positioned the company to deliver exceptional results in 2023. Production, CapEx, cash operating costs and DD&amp;A all beat targets, which underpinned our excellent financial performance during the first quarter. We earned $1.6 billion of adjusted net income and generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow. Free cash flow helped fund year-to-date cash return to shareholders of $1.4 billion through a combination of regular and special dividends and share repurchases executed during the first quarter. <br/>Combined with our full year regular dividend, we have committed to return $2.8 billion to shareholders in 2023 or about 50% of our estimated 2023 free cash flow assuming an $80 oil price. We are well on our way to achieve our target minimum return of 60% of annual free cash flow to shareholders. <br/>Our first quarter results demonstrate the value of EOG's multi-basin portfolio. We have decades of low-cost, high-return inventory that spans oil, combo and dry natural gas basins throughout the country. Our portfolio includes the Delaware Basin, which remains the largest area of activity in the company and is delivering exceptional returns. After more than a decade of high-return drilling, our Eagle Ford asset continues to deliver top-tier results while operating at a steady pace. <br/>And beyond these core foundational assets, we continue to invest in our emerging Powder River Basin, Ohio Utica combo and South Texas Dorado plays, which contribute to EOG's financial performance today while also laying the groundwork for years of future high-return investment. <br/>Our portfolio provides flexibility to invest with discipline and develop each asset at a pace that allows it to get better. It provides optionality to actively manage our investments to minimize impacts from inflation. Diversity of our investment portfolio also translates to diverse sales market options, enabling us to pursue the highest netbacks. <br/>Our shift to premium drilling several years ago has helped to decouple EOG's performance from short-term swings in the market. The result is an ability to deliver consistent, operational and financial performance that our shareholders have come to expect and that drives long-term value through the cycle.<br/>Recession risk and the near-term demand outlook for oil continues to drive volatility of prices month-to-month. However, our outlook remains positive. Inventory levels currently near the 5-year average are reducing as we progress through the year. Global demand continues to increase and is forecast to reach record levels by year-end and new supply has moderated from pre-pandemic levels of growth. Longer term, with the reduced investment in upstream projects the last several years, we remain constructive on future pricing. <br/>For North American gas, near-term prices reflect high inventory levels due to this year's warm winter and reduced LNG demand during repairs at Freeport. As such, we are currently evaluating options to delay some activity at Dorado. The medium and long-term outlook for natural gas, however, continues to strengthen. Currently, U.S. LNG demand is at record levels with an additional 7 Bcf a day capacity under construction or through FID with expected startup between 2024 to 2027 that should position the U.S. as a leader in the global LNG market. <br/>Our confidence in the outlook for our business is demonstrated by our capital allocation decisions in the first quarter. Disciplined reinvestment in our high-return inventory continues to lower our breakeven and expand the free cash flow potential of EOG. <br/>We strengthened our balance sheet by retiring debt, paid out nearly 100% of free cash flow in regular and special dividends, and we utilized our repurchase authorization to buy back $310 million worth of stock late in the quarter during a significant market dislocation. I'm confident EOG has the assets, the technology and the people to deliver both return on capital and return of capital for years to come. <br/>In a moment, Billy will discuss why we believe our foundational assets in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford will provide higher returns, margins and free cash flow in the years ahead and why we remain excited about the progress we are making in our emerging assets, Powder River Basin, Ohio Utica Combo and South Texas Dorado. <br/>But first, here's Tim to review our financial position.",
			"<strong>Timothy K. Driggers</strong>",
			"Thanks, Ezra. EOG generated outstanding financial performance in the first quarter. We produced $1.6 billion of adjusted net income or $2.69 per share and $1.1 billion of free cash flow. Timing differences associated with working capital accounted for an additional $661 million of cash inflow in the quarter. Our outstanding financial results were driven by strong operating performance. <br/>Compared with the prior year, first quarter production volumes increased 2% for oil and 7% overall. We mitigated most of the inflationary headwinds to limit the increase to per unit cash operating costs to just 3% or $10.59 per BOE, which was more than offset by a 12% decline in the DD&amp;A rate. <br/>Capital expenditures in the quarter of $1.5 billion came in $100 million below target. Our long-standing free cash flow priorities and cash return framework remain consistent. Our priorities are sustainable regular dividend growth, a pristine balance sheet, additional cash return options and low-cost property bolt-ons. We are committed to return a minimum of 60% of the annual free cash flow to shareholders through our sustainable regular dividend, special dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. <br/>We believe the consistent application of our free cash flow priorities and transparent cash return framework positions the company to create long-term shareholder value through the cycle.<br/>In March, we strengthened the balance sheet by paying off a $1.25 billion bond at maturity with cash on hand leaving $3.8 billion of debt on the balance sheet. The next maturity is a $500 million bond due April 2025. Cash at the end of the quarter was $5 billion, yielding a net cash position of $1.2 billion, up $300 million from December 31. <br/>Yesterday, our Board declared a second regular dividend of $0.825 per share, the same as last quarter and a 10% increase from the prior year level. The $3.30 annual rate is a $1.9 billion annual commitment. On March 30, we also paid the $1 per share special dividend declared in February. <br/>EOG also repurchased $310 million of stock in the first quarter at an average price of $105 per share. For several days during the last 2 weeks of March, market volatility created a significant dislocation between the price of our stock and the value of the business. We were able to utilize our strong balance sheet to repurchase shares at highly accretive prices. <br/>We will continue to monitor the price and value of our stock, and you should expect us to step into the market again when there are significant dislocations. We are off to a very strong start in 2023 to deliver on our full year cash return commitment of a minimum of 60% of annual free cash flow. <br/>Altogether, the full year regular dividend along with the first quarter special dividend and buybacks represents $2.8 billion of cash return, which is about 50% of the $5.5 billion of free cash flow we forecast for 2023, assuming an $80 oil price. We will continue to monitor oil and gas prices going forward, and we remain committed to delivering on our cash return commitment and look forward to updating you over the rest of the year. <br/>Here's Billy to discuss operations.",
			"<strong>Lloyd W. Helms</strong>",
			"Thanks, Tim. EOG's operating performance continues to improve with the first quarter generating outstanding results. Our first quarter volume, capital expenditures and total per unit cash operating cost performance came in better than our forecasted targets. I'd like to thank our employees for their dedication and outstanding execution, giving us a great start to 2023. <br/>Our full year 2023 capital and production plans are unchanged. We forecast a $6 billion capital program to deliver 3% oil volume growth and 9% total production growth. We maintained the pace of activity from the fourth quarter of last year in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford, our core foundational plays, and continued to expand development in our emerging Powder River Basin, Ohio Utica combo and South Texas Dorado plays. <br/>Well productivity and cost performance are meeting or beating expectations across our portfolio as each play sustains sufficient activity to support continued innovation. <br/>As Ezra mentioned, our foundational assets in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford are performing exceptionally well and were a big part of our overall strong first quarter results. Sustaining a consistent level of activity in these core plays is driving operational improvements and continues to be one of the primary hedges to offset areas of cost inflation. We are excited about the outlook for these assets in the years ahead. <br/>Even as these assets mature, we can apply technical learnings, operational innovation and leverage prior infrastructure investments to continue to improve the operating margin and capital efficiencies of these world-class assets.<br/>In the Delaware Basin, we expect well performance will continue to improve this year, delivering productivity and returns well above the premium hurdle rate. Last year, our Delaware Wolfcamp wells delivered an average 6-month cumulative production of about 34 barrels of oil equivalent per foot and are expected to improve this year. See Slide 10 of our updated investor presentation for details. <br/>While well mix can impact the relative contribution of oil, NGLs and natural gas, overall performance is improving in large part due to continued innovations like our new completion design. We have now tested 39 wells in the Wolfcamp that are yielding an average increase of 22% in the first year production with a 20% uplift in the estimated ultimate recovery compared to the similar wells and targets using our previous completion design. <br/>With these encouraging results, we now expect to deploy this new design on about 70 wells this year. This new design is continuing to show promise as we expand the number of wells and test the design across different targets and basins. Operationally, maintaining a consistent level of activity in the Delaware Basin, combined with our culture of continuous improvement is generating noticeable results. <br/>Drilling times continue to improve and are generating peer-leading performance aided by our drilling motor program and high-performing staff. The amount of footage drilled per motor run improved by 11% in the first quarter as compared to last year. Similar progress is being achieved with our completion operations with the expansion of our Super Zipper technique. These efforts, combined with the opportunities that codeveloped multiple targets in the stacked pay resource by using our existing surface footprint and in infrastructure are expected to drive significant efficiency gains and continue to improve our margins in the Delaware Basin for years to come. <br/>The first -- we first introduced the Super Zipper completion technique in the Eagle Ford in 2020. Since then, we have expanded its use throughout the play and have more than doubled completions efficiency as measured by completed lateral feet per day. As indicated on Page 12 of our quarterly investor slides, the amount of lateral completed per day year-to-date has increased by another 18% compared to last year.<br/>In the first quarter, we also set a record in the Eagle Ford drilling our longest well to date, reaching a measured depth of nearly 26,500 feet with a lateral length of over 15,500 feet. We expect to continue to see completion efficiency improvements as we extend laterals in the Eagle Ford to 3-plus miles where feasible. As a core operating area that has been under development for more than a decade, the Eagle Ford also benefits from our existing infrastructure from over 3,700 producing wells. <br/>Leveraging existing investments made in strategic water, oil and gas infrastructure minimizes future CapEx needs and lowers operating costs. Ongoing improvements to completion operations and leveraging the benefit of existing infrastructure, enable our Eagle Ford finding and development costs to continue to decline. Last year, the Eagle Ford's rate of return was the highest in the play's history. <br/>Longer term, we have over a decade of drilling inventory in the Eagle Ford, allowing us to maintain the current production base while generating high returns and lowering breakevens. <br/>As previously mentioned, we are maintaining activity in our core plays and progressing our newer emerging plays. This year's plan in Dorado contemplates 8 additional wells completed compared to 2022 in order to achieve a consistent level of activity to drive performance improvements. <br/>Our drilling operations are realizing a 29% improvement in the footage drilled per day since 2021. Completion operations will be conducted on a few wells in the second quarter. However, we are evaluating options to delay additional completions originally scheduled later this year due to the current natural gas price environment. To date, operational progress towards improvements and Dorado's well performance is meeting or exceeding our early expectations. <br/>Activity in the Utica combo play is just commencing yet we are already witnessing the compounding effects of sharing technology across our multiple plays. For example, drilling performance for recent wells is improving on the order of 20% to 30% compared to last year's results with the benefit of our proprietary drilling motor program and precision targeting. We expect similar levels of improvement from our completion program once we begin completing wells in the third quarter. <br/>Now for a little color on inflation and industry service costs. As we had anticipated in building this year's plan, the upward inflationary pressure that we witnessed last year appears to have plateaued, which still leaves us confident that our average well cost should increase no more than 10% compared to last year. Early indicators are showing signs of service cost moderation, which is more prevalent in some basins and less than others. <br/>We would expect that any softening of service and tubular costs will be slow to manifest into lower well cost and cash operating costs until much later in the year or more likely in 2024. <br/>As the year unfolds, we will continue to look for opportunities to leverage our scale and the flexibility of our multi-basin portfolio to manage costs across all operating areas. We also remain highly focused on sustainable cost reductions through innovation, operational performance and execution improvements to mitigate inflation and further drive down our cost structure. <br/>Now I'll turn it back to Ezra.",

			"Thanks, Billy. In conclusion, I'd like to note the following important takeaways. First, strong execution from every operating team across our multi-basin portfolio has positioned the company to deliver exceptional results in 2023. Thanks goes to our employees for delivering a great first quarter with their outstanding execution. <br/>Second, our foundational assets in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford are performing exceptionally well and were a significant part of our first quarter results. <br/>Third, our first quarter performance demonstrates the value of EOG's multi-basin portfolio. We have decades of low-cost, high-return inventory that spans oil combo and dry natural gas basins throughout the country. <br/>And fourth, our long-term outlook for both oil and gas remains positive and our shift to premium drilling several years ago has helped decouple EOG's performance from short-term swings in the market. The result is an ability to deliver consistent, operational and financial performance that our shareholders have come to expect and that drives long-term value through the cycle. <br/>Thanks for listening.

			"(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.",
			"<strong>Paul Cheng</strong>",
			"Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Two questions, please. I think the first 1 is probably for Billy. You talked about the Permian, the good well productivity. Just can you give us a little bit more detail in terms of the test size you're doing over there and whether you're increasing it, especially if you start to do more co-development and how many different landing zones or -- that you are targeting in your program? <br/>And second one -- that, just curious, I mean, I think in the last, say, several months, a lot of (inaudible) have been asking why there's the go-ahead with the expansion in Dorado. And I think last quarter in the conference call, management has said you're looking for the long term. So just curious that what may have triggered, maybe there's a slightly change in your view about the pace on that development?",
			"<strong>Lloyd W. Helms</strong>",
			"Yes, Paul, this is Billy. Let me give you a little highlights maybe of the Permian program and what we're seeing there. And then I'll probably ask Jeff to give some more detailed color to help explain some of the improvements we're seeing. <br/>Overall, we're very pleased with the progress our Permian plans are showing. In general, our results are playing out just as we anticipated. In our plans, we had planned -- all of our type curves are modeled and forecasted and the results are meeting or exceeding our forecasted results including the co-development of different targets at the same time. <br/>But I'd like to go ahead and turn it over now to Jeff to maybe talk a little bit about the new completion design, and the results that we're seeing and then some of the productivity improvements.",
			"<strong>Jeffrey R. Leitzell</strong>",
			"Yes. Thanks, Billy. Paul, this is Jeff. Yes, we're extremely happy with our productivity out of the Delaware. And just to give you a little color, 1 of the big things that's really improving that is our new completions design or I should say, kind of our improved completion design. So as Billy stated to date, we've tested around 39 wells in the Wolfcamp, and we're seeing an uplift of about 20% or so in the well productivity. And that's in both the early and late life performance of that. <br/>I'll also note that the uplift, we're not just seeing that in 1 phase. We're seeing both in oil and gas, so kind of across the board. So with these outstanding results, what we've done is we've really expanded this program and we're planning on completing about 70 additional wells in the Wolfcamp this year. So going to be about a 2.5x increase from last year. <br/>And we definitely went ahead and taken this into account both our drilling plans and guidance for 2023. So looking forward with this design, we've had a lot of success in our deeper formations. Our team really plans to continue to kind of test in some of the shallower formations to evaluate its benefits. <br/>One thing that we have observed with this design is that there's varying performance uplift depending on the rock type and the depth of the target. And the design does come with a little bit of a cost increase. So we just want to be mindful about how quickly we're testing it and be strategic at the pace that we're going ahead and put these in the ground. <br/>Also, I'd like to point out that the design isn't really new to EOG. It was actually first tested down in our Eagle Ford asset. And this is just an example of the technology transfer in the company of our multi-basin operations. It's really helped us accelerate our learnings throughout the company. <br/>And then lastly, with the success that we've seen in the Delaware Basin, we're actively testing it in all of our emerging places throughout the company and really looking forward to evaluating those results throughout the year.",
			"<strong>Lloyd W. Helms</strong>",
			"And then, Paul, the other part of your question was on Dorado and really what triggered the change of pace that we're thinking about. We put together a plan originally just to remind everybody that really, it was not a huge acceleration in activity planned for. We're only adding 8 wells. So the plan never contemplated the huge amount of growth in the -- in Dorado to start with. <br/>However, we always remain flexible on our program. And that's the benefit of having a multi-basin portfolio as we can move activity around based on market conditions or other factors as they present themselves, naturally, with gas prices remaining weak, and moving into the year, it's only natural to think about options that we might be able to explore with Dorado activity. And we are exploring the option to delay some completions that were scheduled for later in the year, and we'll give more color on that as that unfolds.",

			"The next question is from the line of Leo Mariani with ROTH Capital Partner.",
			"<strong>Leo Paul Mariani</strong>",
			"I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the buyback versus the special dividend. Obviously, there was no new special dividend, I guess, announced this quarter instead, you got certainly lean on the buyback as you described in March. I just wanted to kind of confirm your thinking around this. <br/>I mean it still sounds like the buyback is going to be reserved only for kind of very opportunistic situations where there is this dislocation. And generally speaking, it's probably more reasonable to expect the special going forward with the buyback kind of maybe every once in a while. Is that kind of how to think about it?",
			"<strong>Ezra Y. Yacob</strong>",
			"Yes. Leo, this is Ezra Yacob. I think that's -- I think you've summarized it pretty well. Our strategy hasn't really changed. We are committed to returning at least 60% of our free cash flow on an annual basis. Year-to-date, as Tim had mentioned, our cash return commitment is $2.8 billion. It's approximately 50% of our -- what would be our fiscal year free cash flow at the assumed $80 oil price there. <br/>And just to recall, the cash return priorities for us, it really begins with the regular dividend as the first priority. The excess free cash flow, as you said, will either come back in the form of special dividends, which we've paid 7 of the last 8 quarters, we've distributed a special dividend or opportunistic buybacks. And what we saw in the first quarter when we executed a repurchase was -- we really saw a dislocation dominantly associated with the banking crisis, and we were able to step in to repurchase approximately $300 million of the stock. So as you pointed out, really in line with our strategy. <br/>Now what I would say has changed over the last 18 months since putting the repurchase authorization in place is really the strength of our company. Our primary value proposition, of course, is investing in high-return projects, adding lower-cost reserves to our company's profile, which thereby reduces our breakevens and expands our margins. And so as we continue to execute on this strategy and we continue to strengthen the company, the way we consider dislocations certainly evolves as well.",
			"<strong>Leo Paul Mariani</strong>",
			"Okay. That's helpful. And I just wanted to see if there's any more of a robust update on the Utica. I think the last time you guys kind of rolled that out, I think you had 4 wells on production with a fair bit of history. Just trying to get a sense if there are more wells producing at this point in time in the Utica? And just any thoughts around some of the long-term performance of those prior wells that have been on for, I guess, over a year at this point?",
			"<strong>Kenneth W. Boedeker</strong>",
			"Yes, Leo, this is Ken. We're making excellent progress on our Utica program this year. We currently have a drilling rig actively operating in our northern area, and we're progressing nicely on our gathering and infrastructure projects. The 4 wells that you talked about that we drilled and completed in 2022 really do continue to deliver our expected performance, and we plan to drill and complete about 15 wells across both our North and Southern areas this year. And we'll have those production results more towards the end of the year. <br/>Another thing to note is we also continue to add acreage and look for additional low-cost opportunities to add to our position.",

			"The next question is from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC.",
			"<strong>Scott Michael Hanold</strong>",
			"Yes. Congrats on the quarter. Ezra, maybe if I could pivot back on the buyback conversation. And if you can give us some color on what were the key triggers on the decision to do buybacks? Was it relative valuation of EOG to peers? Was it just the aggregate move? Or is there other things like intrinsic value assessments that kind of generated that process to really kick it off there?",
			"<strong>Ezra Y. Yacob</strong>",
			"Scott. Yes, this is Ezra. Those are all accurate to the tune of how we kind of look at these opportunities. As we've talked about in the past, it kind of begins with the macro, first of all, right, what's happening on both global and domestic supply and demand balances. As far as dislocations go, we do measure. We look at the intrinsic value of our business relative to different pricing scenarios, both short and long term. And we do evaluate trading multiples, not just at EOG versus the peers, but actually for the entire peer group and see what's happening. <br/>And so 1 comparison that could be made is the dramatic sell-off that the industry saw last summer, which was associated with a pretty dramatic pullback in oil prices, that was really fundamentally supported by a change we felt in the macro outlook. There was a significant announcement there for roughly 300 million barrels of petroleum reserves that would be hitting the market on the supply side from across the globe. <br/>What we saw in the first quarter was not really supported by a big change in the forecast on the fundamentals. Potentially really just triggered from the banking crisis, potentially an increased fear on the demand side from increased recession, but we really feel like most of that has already been priced in to the market on the demand side. <br/>And so when we saw a pullback there in a dislocation with the market, really, again, associated in late March there with the banking crisis, we really didn't hesitate and we're able to step into the market and do that $300 million share repurchase, and we think we've really created a significant amount of value there for the shareholders.",
			"<strong>Scott Michael Hanold</strong>",
			"That's great. And as my follow-up, 1 of the things I think tends to get lost or is underappreciated is the premium pricing you all continue to get on your commodities across the board. And can you just give us a sense of -- as you kind of look forward, do you find more opportunities ahead where you can continue to raise the bar on that as well?",
			"<strong>D. Lance Terveen</strong>",
			"This is Lance. Thanks for the question. Yes, our realizations continue to be excellent. And I mean when we think about it, it's really just the capability that we have. When you think about the multi-basins that we have, but just our transport position, and then the capacity that we've taken out. You hear us talk a lot about control and having control all the way to the water is exceptionally important. <br/>So I would just say, as you think about our position and the price realizations too and then extracting additional premiums, I think our ability to just transact very quickly and with the supply, the scale that we have, I mean we can definitely walk in with further opportunities.",

			"The next question is from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup.",
			"<strong>Scott Andrew Gruber</strong>",
			"I want to circle back on the Wolfcamp development strategy. After looking at Slide 10 here in the deck, last year, you layered in more Wolfcamp M wells. But this year, the percentage of Wolfcamp M will be slowing back down some. Is that impacted by where you'll develop and deploy the new completion design? Or is that a reflection tend to be more selective with where you co-develop the Wolfcamp M? Just what guidance shift in mix?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey R. Leitzell</strong>",
			"Yes, Scott, this is Jeff. Really, with the -- our co-development strategy, it's pretty straightforward. And what we're trying to do is we're just adding in high rate of return targets to our well packages. And really, it's driven by the geology. And obviously, the geology across our acreage, it changes very quickly. So kind of from development unit to development unit, we've really got to strategically dissect what our strategy is going to be there.<br/>But from what we're seeing right now, and you can see that on Slide 10 and 11 in our deck, by adding in some of those deeper targets in the lower Wolfcamp or I should say, the lower Upper Wolfcamp and then the middle, we're achieving economics well over our premium hurdle rates and we have some of the tightest co-development spacing out there in the basin. <br/>So ultimately, just this approach, I mean, it's improving our total recovery per acre helping optimize that NPV of the resource, and it's just adding those barrels finding costs below our current Delaware Basin levels.",
			"<strong>Scott Andrew Gruber</strong>",
			"Got it. And then just looking for some more color on the new completion design. You said it was initially developed and rolled out into Eagle Ford. Did it become a dominant design in the Eagle Ford? And will it become the dominant design in the Permian? And how quickly it can be rolled out to some of your new plays?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey R. Leitzell</strong>",
			"Yes, Scott, great question. So yes, the design, as I talked about, it was first utilized in the Eagle Ford. It was back in -- right around 2016. And we didn't see the same uplift that we see in the Permian. It wasn't quite as extensive, but it really has to do with the difference in rock type and their geological properties between the 2 plays. But it did provide the application, really beneficial as far as helping lower well costs and reduce our completion time. So yes, it is something that we still do employ there in the Eagle Ford, and as I said, in a lot of our emerging plays. <br/>And then as far as in the Delaware and our rollout, our plan is to increase, as I said, the year-over-year number by 2.5x what we did last year. And I also did state, there's just a slight cost increase. So we want to be cognizant of how quickly we roll it out. And like anything in our program, we just don't want to outrun our learnings, and we want to make sure that we continue to evolve this technique as we learn.",

			"<strong>Derrick Lee Whitfield</strong>",
			"With my first question, I wanted to focus on CapEx cadence throughout 2023. With Q1 coming in better than expected and Q2 projected to be heavier than expected, could you comment on the 1 to 2 drivers? And separately, if not part of the answer, could you speak to cadence on non-D&amp;C investments throughout 2023?",
			"<strong>Lloyd W. Helms</strong>",
			"Yes, Derrick, this is Billy Helms. So yes, the second quarter CapEx has gotten to be a little bit higher than the first quarter, and it's mainly due to some non-drilling and completion capital, the indies or infrastructure and those kind of things that we put in our program that it was recently scheduled to occur at the latter half of the first quarter. It turned out to be pushed into the second quarter. That's the reason the first quarter was under our own CapEx and the second quarter is a little bit higher. <br/>And that really sticks to our original plan. We had always planned for about 52% of our CapEx to be spent in the first half of the year. And so we're still on target for that in the 48% in the back half, so that's kind of the way the program plays out.",
			"<strong>Derrick Lee Whitfield</strong>",
			"Great. And with my follow-up, I'd like to focus on your operational efficiency gains in the Eagle Ford. Is your gain principally driven by increased Super Zipper activity? And if so, are there practical limitations on the amount of completions you could pursue utilizing this approach?",
			"<strong>Kenneth W. Boedeker</strong>",
			"Yes, Derek, this is Ken. I'd like to start off by really crediting our team there in San Antonio for driving down that finding cost that you talked about. Really by focusing on improving the efficiency of every portion of the process, we've been able to drive down costs over the past several years and increasing our lateral lengths, while improving targeting and focusing on bit and motor performance in conjunction with the advent of Super Zipper completion operations have really allowed us to improve efficiencies and really drill and complete more lateral footage in a day compared to a few years ago. <br/>And that's really showing up on a lower cost basis. And one thing to note is we do have over 10 years of high-return drilling in this play that can sustain our current production levels and continue to expand our margins.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question is from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.",
			"<strong>John Holliday Abbott</strong>",
			"This is John Abbott on for Doug Leggate. Our questions are really on Dorado. We understand that you're going to potentially delay activity this year. But 1 of the goals that you set out this year was to try to just begin get greater economies of scale into play. When do you think you need to achieve that size and scale, noting that you have additional LNG capacity coming on, exposure in 2026?",
			"<strong>Lloyd W. Helms</strong>",
			"Yes, John, this is Billy Helms. So for Dorado, yes, we are increasing activity there, mainly from a drilling side. Recently, we had planned to also bring in additional completions. On the drilling side, I would add that we are seeing a tremendous improvement in the efficiency gains there. The team there has done just an excellent job of being able to improve our drilling times, lower our well costs and just increase efficiencies overall. <br/>So we're very pleased with the progress we've made. And so I think that increased activity we're seeing on the drilling side is playing out what we're seeing on the drilling results and giving us insights into how we can continue to lower well costs going forward. <br/>On the completion side, we have some planned activity here in the second quarter. But beyond that, we're looking at ways we can -- with the flexibility we have in our program to delay the completion of any wells that would be on in the second half. And really just thinking about how we can leverage some of the learnings from our other programs and plays and combine that activity with the activity we have in Dorado by sharing equipment, people and those learnings across our portfolio. <br/>So we don't really feel the need to jump in and complete those wells, but we are evaluating options as they roll out, and we'll see how those present themselves. <br/>And then as far as the activities for LNG demand, I guess the play -- the unique thing about this play, it didn't take a lot of wells. The wells are very prolific. So we're well ahead of any timing that we would need to add LNG capacity in the future. And then we also have the flexibility of moving gas from other operating areas, multi-basin portfolio to the Gulf Coast. <br/>So don't think of the Dorado was just simply applying itself to the LNG market. It's got the opportunity but looking at gas from other plays to the Gulf Coast as well through our marketing arrangements.",
			"<strong>John Holliday Abbott</strong>",
			"That's extremely helpful, which leads to the next question. Assuming there was not an issue, it's gas prices, how do you think about the optimal level of production for that play or activity long term? I mean, how big does it kind of get to? How do you think about that approach -- efficiency program longer term?",
			"<strong>Kenneth W. Boedeker</strong>",
			"Yes, John, this is Ken. I think the real thing in Dorado is it doesn't take a lot of wells to generate significant volumes out of that play. So I don't know the exact right pace. But what we want to do is we want to develop this at the right pace where we don't outrun our learnings. We're making significant progress as we really get those operational synergies together that Billy talked about.

And I know at 1 time, you suggested you had almost 1,700 locations and I'm just wondering your thoughts around this?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey R. Leitzell</strong>",
			"Yes, Neal, this is Jeff. No, we have outstanding results there in the Powder right now, and it's some of the lowest finding costs that we're seeing there in the whole portfolio. So yes, we still have between kind of our full South Powder River Basin and then moving up to our North, about 1,600 net undrilled premium locations. <br/>So just looking at our program, everything is on pace this year. The wells are performing as we expected. Q1, we've completed about 15 gross wells, which 2/3 of those were (inaudible). And we're seeing a lot of benefits also by getting some consistent activity up there in the Powder. We're running a consistent 2 to 3 rigs and 1 full (inaudible) with that, which is really allowing them to kind of push their efficiencies. <br/>And then we also have a lot of confidence in the play just with the overall performance and (inaudible). And then from there, as we talked about, we want to go ahead and gather the data in the upper overlying formations like the Niobrara, so we can develop that later in the future. <br/>And then also, additional confidence in the play, I think, would be really -- should be said is that the infrastructure acquisition that we had. We had noted that in our 10-Q, we acquired Evolution. And I'll go ahead and let maybe Lance say a couple of things on that.",
			"<strong>D. Lance Terveen</strong>",
			"Yes. No, thanks, Jeff. Yes, just to add to that, on our confidence when we think about the Powder River Basin, we did make a strategic investment there. That was about $135 million, and we view that as a bolt-on acquisition and that's really midstream footprint. There's a plant and gathering system that just overlays our southern acreage. The plant is a first-class asset. It was completed in 2019 and when we think about this, it just really complements our existing gas gathering infrastructure build-out as we have connections in place. So we really look at that as value because we can load that plant, fill the plant very quickly. <br/>And there's also other benefits that we see long term as well. As we think about just lowering cash operating costs, gathering, processing expense versus third parties, we'll have control and redundancy, but then also to the confidence we can expand that very quickly. So the last thing I just want to...",

			"<strong>D. Lance Terveen</strong>",
			"When we think about that, we think about actually the gathering, processing and transportation expense. So it's absolutely when we think about loading it with our equity gas into that facility and having to control, we're definitely going to see better netbacks. But it's more as we think about just controlling the cost and lowering the cost basis of the company that's going to absolutely make the Powder River Basin and the Southern acres they are more competitive.",

			"Back to the Wolfcamp codevelopment. If you're hitting 2-plus targets in the Wolfcamp versus, say, cherry picking the best zone, all things being equal, you'd expect wells to get worse, yet you're seeing wells get better. Is that attributable completely to the design change?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey R. Leitzell</strong>",
			"No, I'd say it's attributed to our co-development strategy. I mean it's -- really, it's been a process over time. So if you look at back in 2016 in the Wolfcamp -- or I should say our strategy through the whole Permian, we had 6 unique targets. And kind of fast forward here, we're up to 18 unique targets. And obviously, with that, the spacing has changed both in zone and from a vertical perspective. <br/>So our teams have methodically obviously tested this. They've taken into account the actual spacing, how they interact, the depletion to it. And we've come up obviously with the best co-development strategy really to maximize the overall production of those intervals and then obviously maximize the economics related to it.",
			"<strong>Robert Alan Brackett</strong>",
			"I guess the follow-up would be, so it sounds like the co-development strategy is driven by that desire to maximize the lack of communication between zones? Or is it more driven by just logistics of having that kit sit in 1 spot for a longer time?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey R. Leitzell</strong>",

			"<strong>Arun Jayaram</strong>",
			"I wanted to come back to the new completion design. You highlighted how you've tested this on 39 wells, and you plan to go to 70 wells. And my question is, was the 20% uplift relative to wells in the same area or relative to the -- to your type curve? And maybe the follow-up is, are the 70 wells contemplated for this calendar year and was that part of your guidance? Did that include that? Or would that reflect an upside risk to your oil guide?",
			"<strong>Lloyd W. Helms</strong>",
			"Yes, Arun, this is Billy. So the uplift we're seeing -- part of that was actually baked into our guidance. We didn't bake in the entire amount. So when we put together our plan, we understood that there were going to be some uplift. We did plan on 70 wells to be part of that calendar year program. And we've baked in some of that into our production guidance, knowing that we would see some uplift. I think the uplift is surprising us a little bit more to the upside, but I would say that's already factored into our guidance that we've issued. <br/>And then as far as the -- what we're doing there, we were finding that the target is critical. So the rock type is critical too why it works in some areas. And so we're cautiously moving through our program to make sure we test as we go to understand which our targets lend themselves best to this design change and which ones don't because it does cost a little bit more, and we want to be very disciplined on how we apply that across the fields we maximize as Jeff was saying, the economics of the play.",

The Dorado, evaluating the slowdown, can you give some insight in your thinking? Is this about the natural gas price falling below your $250 double premium? Or is this about the contango you see in the curve and just the value of just waiting a few months? Is it -- I recognize those aren't exclusive, but just some insight into what really (inaudible) you guys to want to examine that?",
			"<strong>Lloyd W. Helms</strong>",
			"Yes, Charles, this is Billy. Certainly, it really is not triggered on a specific gas price, but just the overall softness we see in the current market conditions and the need to simply bring more gas on in this current condition. As we talk near term, we understand the near-term softness in the market but longer term -- medium and longer term, we're still very bullish on the long-term outlook for gas. So we do look at the different -- the flexibility we have in the program, and we're evaluating options to be able to successfully push those back in the year. <br/>And we're just continue to remain disciplined on our investment to make sure we're maximizing the value to the company over the long term.",

So I got the message, I think, in your last -- your response to the last question, that this is not going to be an across-the-board shift that you'd want to make. But presumably, you've confirmed -- I think you're talking about 16 targets of works-in. Can you give us a sense does a work-in a quarter of the targets and maybe upside to half or 3 quarters? Or what's it look like to you guys right now?",

			"Yes. This is Jeff again. Yes, that is correct. It's not necessarily a 1 size fits all across. It really does have to do with the geology that we're applying it to. And when looking particularly there in the Permian, we primarily just applied it down in the deeper Wolfcamp targets. So that would basically be just kind of the up or down through the middle in a co-development standpoint. Now we are testing on those shallower targets, but there are quite a few different rock types. <br/>So right now, I'd say it's area by area.

			"<strong>Ezra Y. Yacob</strong>",
			"Yes, Neil, this is Ezra. As I stated kind of in the opening remarks, we still remain constructive on kind of the longer-term gas story for the U.S. We think that the U.S., especially Dorado being a big piece of it has really captured low cost of gas supply that can really compete on the global scale with the amount of LNG that the U.S. is exporting right now, which is at record levels right now for the U.S. combined with the number of projects that have made it through a financial or a final investment decision. <br/>And then the additional projects that are still being kind of planned and discussed, the U.S. will be long-term position to be really a global leader in the LNG market. Now gas is always difficult because it is highly volatile when it comes to things like the short-term pricing on weather. And it's 1 reason you've heard this morning from both myself, Ken and Billy that the most important thing we look at when we develop Dorado is to really invest in that at the right pace for the long term. <br/>We want to make sure that we're not out running our learnings, that we appropriately invest to be able to keep our costs low, and at the end of the day, really keep our margins wide. We want to put in the correct infrastructure to keep our low operating costs because the margins are always pretty skinny on gas and the low-cost producer for gas is going to be able to be exposed to the global market here in the U.S. for the long term.",

And we started with that 60% because we feel confident on that, especially when we roll in kind of almost a peer-leading regular dividend that we'd be able to compete and deliver that through the cycles. <br/>So when we think about a specific target for cash on hand, I wouldn't say that we have a real target. We have spoken about some indicators and things that we strategically think about as far as holding a cash balance. The first, of course, is we like to have a bit of cash on balance just to run the business to make us allow us to stay out of commercial paper. And historically, that's around about $2 billion kind of depending at what point you are in the cycle. <br/>And then in addition to that, we do like to have cash on hand so that we can be strategic and countercyclically invest in opportunities as they arise, whether that's at times investing in casing or line pipe, or last year, we were able to step in and do an acquisition in 1 of our emerging plays there in the Utica, where we actually purchased approximately 130,000 mineral rights. <br/>And then lastly, of course, just the stock repurchase, which we exercised here in the first quarter. We've talked about being able to utilize that opportunistically and really part of our strategy, the reason that you can actually step into a dislocated market and have the confidence to do a buyback is that you've got the strength of the balance sheet, which includes cash on hand. That's really what we're going for. <br/>And so I think that provides another compelling reason to carry potentially a higher cash balance than the company has historically done.",

			"<strong>Thomas E. Jorden</strong>",
			"Thank you, Dan, and welcome to all of you who have joined us for our first quarter conference call. Coterra had an excellent first quarter. We delivered on all fronts: Production at the high end of our guidance, capital within our targeted front-loaded cadence and significant progress on our buyback. These results were driven by outstanding asset performance, a recurring trend you should expect from Coterra. Oil production exceeded the high end of our guidance, driven by strong performance in our Permian, Wolfcamp and Harkey developments. Our Anadarko projects also continued to deliver above our expectations and set the stage for future activity increases. In particular, part of our production beat was driven by continued outperformance of the Anadarko Miller Trust project, which was brought online last year. The Anadarko is an underappreciated gem within a strong portfolio. <br/>Finally, our Marcellus program outperformed in Q1 as we continue to develop a mix of lower and upper Marcellus targets. <br/>As we look ahead, we see continuing volatility in our underlying commodities. As of the close of business yesterday, 12-month NYMEX gas strip had fallen to $2.90 per Mcf. The 12-month WTI oil stood at $67 per barrel. Two quarters ago, we were looking at a 2023 oil strip of $83 and natural gas strip of $5.30. <br/>There are growing fears of a significant recession, which have been exacerbated by the ongoing banking challenges. Fortunately, we at Coterra have some experience with living through volatility and uncertainty. Our formula is simple: Keep our debt low, strive for assets with a low cost of supply, stress test our investments with downside commodity price scenarios and make capital allocation decisions that optimize returns and preserve flexibility. <br/>Service costs appear to have crested and are trending modestly downward. Although we welcome service cost moderation, it does not substitute for our mandate to push forward with operational efficiencies, project architectures that maximize investment returns and the application of best-in-class technology to leverage our efforts for value creation. We focus on things that are within our control. <br/>We are on track with the 3-year plan outlined in our Q1 release. In line with our initial plan, we will reduce activity in the Marcellus in the coming weeks and expect to remain at two rigs and one frac crew during the second half of the year. If we were to hold this level of activity flat through 2025, future Marcellus CapEx would decrease significantly and yet hold our Northeast production flat, allowing us the option to redirect activity to the Permian and Anadarko. Both of these basins have opportunities at the ready that provide great returns. Furthermore, our Marcellus assets retained the flexibility to grow in the future should macro conditions and prices warrant increased investment. Looking forward, we retain maximum optionality to employ capital to its best use. <br/>We also look forward to publishing our 2023 sustainability report later this year. We're making great progress in understanding methane monitoring, including the discrepancies between the various technologies available to the industry. Coterra is working with our vendors to improve the available technology, understand the limitations and choose the best solution for the problem in hand. <br/>With the varying environmental conditions between the Permian, Anadarko and Marcellus, we have learned that there is no single scalable solution that can be successfully deployed across our portfolio. Instead, we will rely on multiple technologies to detect, measure and reduce our methane emissions. Coterra will remain a leading company in innovative design and facility modification to reduce emissions. We also appreciate the collaboration with an outstanding set of competitor companies as we work together to solve this problem. This is an industry-wide challenge, and industry collaboration will be key to finding workable solutions our nation and the world depend upon. <br/>With that, I will turn the call over to Scott to walk us through the particulars of a great Q1.",
			"<strong>Scott C. Schroeder</strong>",
			"Thanks, Tom. Today, I will discuss our first quarter '23 results, shareholder returns and updates to guidance. During the first quarter, Coterra reported net income of $677 million, discretionary cash flow of $1.039 billion, accrued capital expenditures of $569 million and free cash flow of $556 million. Despite natural gas and oil prices falling 30% and 19%, respectively, versus 1Q '22, discretionary cash flow declined only 16% year-over-year. This was driven by an increase of the company's oil and NGL production, which caused Coterra's liquids production miss to increase 3% year-over-year to 28%. The company expects greater than 55% of its 2023 revenue to come from oil and NGL sales. <br/>Also during the quarter, the company realized a cash hedge gain totaling $100 million versus $172 million loss in Q1 '22. First quarter total production volumes averaged 635 MBoe per day, with oil averaging 92.2 Mbo per day and natural gas volumes at 2.76 Bcf per day. Oil and BOE finished 2.5% and 1.6% above the high end of guidance respectively, and natural gas hit the high end. The strong performance was driven by a combination of positive well productivity trends and improved cycle times. <br/>Turn-in lines during the quarter totaled 49 net wells above expectations. The incremental wells came online late in the quarter. First quarter accrued capital expenditures totaled $569 million, as I said before, but the cash capital expenditures only $483 million, consistent with expectations. <br/>Turning to return of capital. We announced a $0.20 per share base dividend and remain one of the highest-yielding base dividends in the industry. Management and the Board remain committed to responsibly increasing the base dividend on an annual cadence. <br/>During the first quarter, Coterra followed through on its return priorities by repurchasing 11 million shares or $268 million. In total, we returned 76% of free cash flow during the quarter. As we communicated in February, it is our intention to pursue strategic buybacks ahead of variable dividends. We have over $1.7 billion remaining on our $2 billion buyback authorization. We are reiterating our annual commitment to return 50% plus of free cash flow to shareholders. <br/>Lastly, I will discuss the refinements to our '23 guidance and activity outlook. We reiterated the company's capital estimate of $2.0 billion to $2.2 billion. While we are seeing clear signs of cost softening, we have yet to realize meaningful savings and therefore, have not built any future cost reductions into our forecast. We are increasing our full year oil guidance 1% to 87 to 93 Mbo per day, driven by efficient operations and strong well performance in both the Permian and Anadarko basins. The total company well turn-in lines are unchanged from our original guidance. <br/>In the Marcellus, as Tom has stated in his remarks, we are finishing up a development this month and then plan to drop 1 of our 2 frac crews and hold a single crew for the balance of the year. We also plan to drop from 3 rigs to 2 rigs this summer as planned earlier this year. <br/>In the Anadarko, a late '23 turn-in line was pushed into '24. This lowers our Anadarko turn-in lines to seven wells, down from our prior range of 10 to 15 wells. We now intend to maintain 1 to 2 rigs in the basin for the remainder of '23. <br/>In the Permian, we expect to continue to run six rigs for the remainder of the year and will pivot between 2 and 3 frac crews. Due to improved cycle times, we expect to bring on an additional five wells in the Permian during late '23, offsetting the lower turn-in lines in Anadarko. <br/>Turning to unit cost. The company's guidance remains unchanged at midpoint, but there was some moving pieces primarily driven by reclassification between cost categories, which occurred after completing our integration into a single accounting system earlier this year. We also reiterated our 3-year outlook, which assumes the company achieves a 3-year oil CAGR of 5%, BOE and natural gas CAGR of 0% to 5%, which is achievable with capital and activity that is flat to down relative to '23. <br/>In summary, despite commodity headwinds, Coterra's outlook remains strong, driven by continued strong execution, we are well positioned to meet or exceed our 2023 targets. <br/>With that, I will turn it back to the operator for Q&amp;A.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan.",
			"<strong>Arun Jayaram</strong>",
			"Nice results from your team. I wanted to see if I could delve into your commentary around the potential activity in the Marcellus. You mentioned that your original plan was to go down to 2 rigs and 1 frac crew, but you also signaled that you may stay at this level for a certain amount of time given the gas macro. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of -- do you think you could hold your Marcellus production relatively flat at, call it, that 2.1 Bcf a day? And what would that mean for CapEx if you did go down to that level because I think this year's CapEx guides around $835 million at the midpoint.",
			"<strong>Thomas E. Jorden</strong>",
			"Well, Arun, we -- you just kind of repeated what I've said. So I'll try to give a little bit of detail there. What I said is, if we were to stay at the 2 rig and 1 frac crew, that's not a plan. That's kind of a guide as to what would happen. We kind of -- as we look at the macro right now, we kind of like that and where it positions us. <br/>Our Marcellus team has done a really nice job of smoothing out their cadence and getting on to a regular program. So as we look ahead at that level of activity, we think we will be able to shave off significant capital in the Marcellus and have the opportunity to redeploy that elsewhere. <br/>We would hold our production flat or actually slightly grow. Within that range we've already telegraphed, and it's really a nice place to be right now. Because strategically, what we'd like to do is keep that Marcellus production flattish and be ready to go when the gas macro improves. And that's exactly the position that our really great team in Pittsburgh has put us in. <br/>So everything you said is true. I'm not sure what other color we can give. But one of the things we really like is the flexibility to pivot and we're maintaining that gas production. We don't want to see it decline. So it will indeed maintain if we were to hold those 2 rigs and 1 frac crew.",
			"<strong>Arun Jayaram</strong>",
			"Yes, Tom, I don't know if you could follow up just one question with how much lower CapEx would it be if you went to that program?",
			"<strong>Thomas E. Jorden</strong>",
			"With current costs, we think a few out years would probably be a couple hundred million below what we're currently spending in the Marcellus.",
			"<strong>Arun Jayaram</strong>",
			"That's super helpful. The second question perhaps for you and Scott. Tom, you have been handily surpassing the 50-plus percent minimum cash return threshold to shareholders. You're at 76% this year. I was wondering if you could get some color on thoughts over the balance of the year. And I know that you're framework -- under your framework, you like to keep around $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. You're essentially at that level at the end of March. So any thoughts on the ability to kind of sustain this, call it mid-70s type of cash return over the balance of the year because you really don't have much debt due until a little bit into 2024, I believe?",
			"<strong>Scott C. Schroeder</strong>",
			"Yes. This is Scott. Great question. We worked -- everything you said is exactly correct. We did reaffirm the 50-plus percent. We're very comfortable with that. That affords us really, as we shared with our Board yesterday, the ability to be very opportunistic when you go back and look at the report card for the last 5 quarters, including this first one this year, we have surpassed the 50-plus percent. <br/>It is a floor depending on market conditions and where we want to be and what the commodity strip is doing. We will -- it's an investment decision with all three pieces playing into it. Do we want to lean in more on the buyback? Do we want to hold cash for some other strategic opportunity? Or do we just want to kind of stay on path and just rely more on the base dividend. <br/>We have all that optionality. I'm sorry to come across as a little coy, but we're very comfortable with that framework, and we're set up tremendously for this year in terms of that optionality.",
			"<strong>Thomas E. Jorden</strong>",
			"Arun, if I could just follow up on, I'll say this, Scott and his team have really been masterful in how they've executed our buyback, taking opportunities when the price dips. We're going to continue to be disciplined there. But the fact that we're reaffirming our 50-plus is not arbitrary. We really want to maintain flexibility in our balance sheet. And if we were to have a quarter in the future where we returned exactly 50%, we have nothing to apologize for. <br/>We want to be really clear with people that that's our intent, and that we think that there may be alternate uses of cash. It could be -- I hope it's a constructive buyback program. But if we don't think that's the right way to go, we're just not going to embark in an arms race of cash return. We just don't think that's in the best interest of the Coterra owner, and we have great opportunities within our portfolio, and we're fairly constructive on commodity pricing going forward. So we're right where we want to be.",
			"<strong>Arun Jayaram</strong>",
			"Sounds good. It does give you a lot of flexibility.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And your next question comes from the line of Umang Choudhary from Goldman Sachs.",
			"<strong>Umang Choudhary</strong>",
			"My first question was just wanted to get your thoughts around the macro, both oil and gas. I mean, definitely a lot of concerns around demand for oil and the pace at which it will effect supply to balance the markets in natural gas. And given these concerns, as you think through your program, one of the goals has been to maintain consistent activity to maximize efficiency. How do you -- what are the levers you can pull, right? To maximize your free cash flow outlook over the next 3 years?",
			"<strong>Thomas E. Jorden</strong>",
			"Well, Umang, that's an excellent question. I think we've described it as the fact that we do have the optionality to liberate some capital out of our Marcellus program and redeploy it to more liquids-rich opportunities would be a pivot to maximize our cash flow in the next few years. <br/>We have historically not done a really good job of predicting commodity swings. And as I said in my opening remarks, 6 months ago, the situation looked entirely different. It's changed and yet now we're all highly confident that we know what the future looks like. And so having that flexibility really allows us to get up every morning and make good long-term decisions. <br/>We don't make those decisions based on the daily spot price. We make those decisions as we see macro trends. Right now, as we look forward, we are in the long run, highly constructive on gas. Over the next year, we're going to be cautious. That's why we want to maintain our gas production, but not go nuts there. So we think our program does answer the question you've asked as far as maximizing our cash flow.",
			"<strong>Umang Choudhary</strong>",
			"Yes. That makes a lot of sense. And then I guess the follow-up on that would be the other way to ensure and manage risk would be around hedging. So any thoughts around oil and gas hedging over the next -- for the next 1 or 2 years?",
			"<strong>Scott C. Schroeder</strong>",
			"Yes. In terms of hedging, obviously, we haven't moved away from our strategy around -- organization and all the opportunities. We don't have to lean in on hedging. The last thing you want to do is lean in on hedging when prices are low. History will show that, that always kind of comes back to bite you. <br/>We're looking at a more calculated, more refined way. We're in the early stages of that. More to come on it. But right now, we don't feel the need to lean in, in either oil or gas to protect the downside. We're pretty comfortable with where we're at, and we'll show some optimism on both products or at least particularly on the gas side, going out farther. <br/>So we'll stay on path right now, but we are open to looking at disconnects farther out of the curve. One dynamic that may -- you may see in place with the team we're working with is maybe we look a little further out than just the 12 months that we've been doing historically. And I think that behooves us to really open our minds to be more open-minded to how we hedge going forward.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America.",
			"<strong>Kaleinoheaokealaula Scott Akamine</strong>",
			"This is actually Kalei on for Doug. My first question is on inflation. So as the commodity has pulled back a bit, activity seems to be softening. What are you guys seeing on leading-edge pricing at the moment? And how are you guys positioned to respond to it?",
			"<strong>Blake A. Sirgo</strong>",
			"Yes. Kalei, this is Blake. I'll take that one. We are seeing the softening across the whole market. It's been slight, but it's starting to pick up some steam. <br/>I'll start with OCTG. We've seen pipe prices roll over. The way we order pipe, that really won't impact us to Q3 or Q4, but we estimate that could impact our program $15 to $20 per foot if we realize all that. <br/>On the frac side, we talked about last time on how our contracts work for the year. We have quarterly renegotiation points and semiannual renegotiation points on our frac crews. We saw some very slight reductions from Q1 going into Q2, but it was a reduction. And right now, we're having the conversations to Q2 to Q3, and they're different conversations than we were having just a quarter ago. So we'll see how those progress. <br/>On the rig side, we're really in really good shape. Most of our long-term contracts are actually falling off within Q2. By the end of Q2, only 20% of our rig fleet will be under any type of long-term contract. We're seeing movement there. We are seeing some deflation. We're in discussion with all those folks right now. <br/>But we have really long-term service partners. Folks we've been through a lot of cycles with and they are productive discussions. I think everyone understands the market we're in today is not the market we were in a year ago.",
			"<strong>Kaleinoheaokealaula Scott Akamine</strong>",
			"I guess to press a little bit, if you were to renegotiate some of those contracts, is that more of a benefit to the back half of '23's capital budget? Or is this more of a '24 consideration?",
			"<strong>Blake A. Sirgo</strong>",
			"I would think of it more as it would impact second half '23 and kind of set up a run rate going into '24.",
			"<strong>Kaleinoheaokealaula Scott Akamine</strong>",
			"I appreciate that. My next question is on the revised oil guidance. You guys raised it by 1,000 barrels per day. And I guess I'm wondering if you can really call it with that much accuracy or the intention here is to send a signal. And if it is to send a signal, what are you trying to convey about the performance that you're seeing so far? Is it sort of continues at this pace, do you see further upside risk to guidance as we go through the year?",
			"<strong>Thomas E. Jorden</strong>",
			"Kalei, this is -- I think it speaks for itself. We're seeing great performance on these projects. We are optimistic. We try to guide as we see it. But we don't sandbag, but we're really seeing some surprises to the upside. And I think that we would love to see further surprises to the upside, but we really try to call it as we see it.",
			"<strong>Kaleinoheaokealaula Scott Akamine</strong>",
			"I guess if you raised the guidance, is it based on what you saw in 1Q continuing? Or is it sort of assuming that you get back to a more normal level? Or what does it say about the expectations for the balance of the year?",
			"<strong>Thomas E. Jorden</strong>",
			"Well, it says that we're seeing increasing results that recalibrate our analysis. And as we look at the projects coming forward, we think that's appropriate recalibration. <br/>We learn along the way, and we love to learn on the upside. But you know what? Every now and then, you go the other way. But right now, our oil assets are really, really performing well.",
			"<strong>Kaleinoheaokealaula Scott Akamine</strong>",
			"I appreciate those comments.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from the line of Michael Scialla from Stephens.",
			"<strong>Michael Stephen Scialla</strong>",
			"Tom, you talked about being ready to grow your Marcellus production when the market signals you should. I want to get your view on constraints on pipelines or, I guess, Blake talked about the rig and crew situation softening, but any potential constraints on getting rigs or crews back when you decide to pivot back to growth mode?",
			"<strong>Thomas E. Jorden</strong>",
			"Well, I'll tell you that and turn it over to Blake. We do have some available capacity to grow. It's not unlimited. It's not without boundaries. But over a few year time period, we've got a lot of availability on that market takeaway. Blake, why don't you...",
			"<strong>Blake A. Sirgo</strong>",
			"Yes, just to echo Tom, we do have options to grow our gas volumes there. There is the pipeline space. It might come with a little higher cost than our current differentials. So that would be something that would have to go into the discussion. <br/>As far as rig and fracs, you just got to stay ahead of it. It's not something we could knee jerk, but we could get the crews and rigs as long as we are playing out time.",
			"<strong>Michael Stephen Scialla</strong>",
			"Appreciate that. And I wanted to ask on the Upper Marcellus. You've talked about delineations there. When you look at your 529 Upper Marcellus locations that you had in inventory at the end of the year, if the delineation works, I guess, what would be the impact on the number? Are you talking about potentially like doubling the inventory? Or is it modest increase? I'm just looking for some sense of what delineation could mean for the inventory?",
			"<strong>Thomas E. Jorden</strong>",
			"No, that inventory is really with our current acreage footprint. We are back to leasing in the Marcellus and filling in that acreage footprint. And our team in Pittsburgh has done a really nice job of that. But that is with our current model of spacing, with our current acreage. So that's what -- that's the number.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann from Truist Securities.",
			"<strong>Neal David Dingmann</strong>",
			"First is on, I guess, an M&amp;A-type question. Specifically, I'm just wondering could you discuss opportunities to sort of trade and block up your Delaware acreage specifically in New Mexico, where it looks like you have a little bit more scattered position there?",
			"<strong>Thomas E. Jorden</strong>",
			"Well, New Mexico is a tough area to walk up. The ownership is like a quilt or patch. There are some assets on the market that we've looked at. But even at today's prices, it's being -- assets are marketed at full retail. And we're going to be very cautious on M&amp;A. <br/>With our balance sheet and our organizational capacity, we would love to find a transaction that adds value to our owners and it increases our opportunity for operations. Quite frankly, a lot of the assets out there have peaked production. They've really drilled to increase production over the short run and have rather short inventory behind that. And that doesn't do much for us. <br/>We've also traded and done a lot of swaps to increase our ability to block up our drilling spacing units and have long laterals. So there's a lot of that type of activity. That's the benefit of us and the operators we trade with. But we look at everything. We're very active in that market, but we're going to be really cautious and preserve value for our shareholders.",
			"<strong>Neal David Dingmann</strong>",
			"Yes. Like your strategic nature, Tom, it's always paid dividends. My second question, maybe just sticking with the Del, Could you give me an idea of sort of -- I know you mentioned or you or Scott mentioned six rigs likely to continue active on the Del this year. Could you remind me kind of what area that will focus? And as a result, really any notable change in the GOR this year versus last?",
			"<strong>Thomas E. Jorden</strong>",
			"No. That tends to move around depending on the nature of the program, where we're permitted. This year, looking ahead, we're heavily in reach. We're heavy in Culberson. Eddy is a lower share. Lake County is still very active. It's in our deck, our breakdown of where our activity is. But it does tend to ebb and flow. But you're probably going to see the majority of it on any given year and being reach for Culberson, just because of theirs State of Texas, the time line between project inception and moving dirt is pretty short, whereas you get into Mexico, you have state and federal permit constraints and it's just not as nimble, but it's going to flow.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum from TD Cowen.",
			"<strong>David Adam Deckelbaum</strong>",
			"I was curious -- I wanted to ask a bit -- I don't know if my eyes are just playing tricks on me, but when I look at presentations, are you including greater activity at this point for the Harkey zones? And I guess you didn't touch on that specifically I guess, with this presentation, but can you update us on how the Harkey performance is relative to sort of the other programs in Culberson? And how you're thinking about that zone? And perhaps the more challenged commodity environment today?",
			"<strong>Thomas E. Jorden</strong>",
			"Well, we love the Harkey. I'll say the Harkey, like so many, is highly variable. It's not a one size fits all. So around the basin, it's going to vary. But in a lot of our position, it's highly and competes very nicely with Wolfcamp. We're very active in the Harkey as you can look at our Slide 12. We've got a lot of Harkey in our program. I think we'll continue with that. <br/>And it depends on where you are. There's places where it's right on top of the Wolfcamp. There's places where it's a little lower than the Wolfcamp, but it's one of the best landing zones in the basin. I'll say that flat out.",
			"<strong>David Adam Deckelbaum</strong>",
			"I appreciate the color there. It doesn't sound like necessarily a composition has shifted from quarter-to-quarter, per se, though.",
			"<strong>Thomas E. Jorden</strong>",
			"No, no.",
			"<strong>David Adam Deckelbaum</strong>",
			"Okay. Shifting just to the Marcellus briefly, just to revisit lateral length progression over the next several years. The upper obviously, has a greater weight, I think, and I think you all said in the '23 program versus what you expect to do in '24, '25. Should we expect that future upper wells that are in the program in '24, '25 are still in that, call it, 11,500-foot range? Or how do you think about the average lateral length for the upper versus the lower in the next few years?",
			"<strong>Thomas E. Jorden</strong>",
			"Well, the average lateral length in the upper is going to be on the longer end of that. The upper is fairly wide open. So I think you're looking at average lateral lengths, they're going to be 10,000 to 15,000 feet, probably closer to the lower end of that, depending on what our units look like. So a lot of the average lateral length of the Marcellus program is really a combination or a function of the upper versus lower mix. As we fill out the lower, we're going to have shorter lateral lengths because we're filling in islands that are undeveloped. Yes, hopefully, that answers your question.",

Any material comments concerning future results or operations will be communicated through news releases, publicly announced conference calls or other means that will constitute public disclosure for the purposes of Regulation FD. <br/>It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Eric Slifka.",
			"<strong>Eric S. Slifka</strong>",
			"Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by thanking the entire Global team for propelling us to a solid start in fiscal 2023. Our performance reflects the great work being done across our liquid energy terminal network and convenient markets every day to deliver quality products and superior service to our customers and guests. Q1 was another strong quarter for our GDSO segment, which posted a 6.1% higher product margin. This increase helped more than offset the effects of warmer than normal temperatures on distillates and other weather-related -- weather-sensitive products. Our results speak to the diversification of our business model, which serves us extremely well in what is frequently a dynamic weather environment. On our year-end call, I spoke with you about 3 acquisitions we completed in 2022. These transactions have strengthened the earnings power of our GDSO portfolio, adding more than 60 company-operated convenience markets and related fuel operations, along with fuel supply arrangements at more than 55 additional sites. <br/>In March, we signed a joint venture agreement to invest alongside ExxonMobil to acquire 64 convenience and fueling facilities in the greater Houston area. The agreement is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023. We are excited about the opportunity to expand our footprint into the fast-growing Texas market and look forward to operating these sites on behalf of the joint venture. <br/>On the corporate governance front, during the first quarter, we were extremely pleased to welcome Clare McGrory to our Board of Directors. As CFO and COO at Atairos a $6 billion strategic investment firm, Clare has been instrumental in guiding growth-oriented businesses across a wide range of industries. She also brings more than 13 years of energy experience to our Board, having served as CFO, EVP and Treasurer for Sunoco, LP. We look forward to benefiting from Clare's strategic experience, industry perspectives and leadership background. <br/>Turning to our distribution. In April, the Board agreed upon a quarterly cash distribution of $0.6550 or $2.62 on an annualized basis on all our outstanding common units for the period from January 1 to March 31. The distribution will be paid on May 15 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on May 9, 2023. Let me conclude my remarks by updating you on the status of our agreement with Gulf Oil Limited Partnership to acquire 5 of Gulf's refined product terminals in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts and New Jersey. We are continuing to work through the regulatory review process, and we'll share any material developments as appropriate. <br/>Now let me turn the call over to Greg for the financial review. Greg?",
			"<strong>Gregory B. Hanson</strong>",
			"Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Looking at our first quarter 2020 results. Adjusted EBITDA was $76 million compared with $74.9 million and net income was $29 million compared with $30.5 million for the same period in 2022. DCF was $46.3 million compared with $49.9 million in the same period last year. Please note that adjusted EBITDA and DCF included net gain on sale and disposition of assets of $2.1 million and $4.9 million for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. TTM distribution coverage as of March 31, 2023, included -- including the Q4 2022 onetime special distribution was 3.3x or 3.2x after factoring in distribution to our preferred unitholders. Excluding the net gain on the sale of assets, which included the gain from our sale of our Revere terminal in June of last year, TTM distribution coverage was 2.7x or 2.6x after factoring in distributions to our preferred unitholders. <br/>Turning to our segment details. GDSO product margin was up $10.5 million in the quarter to $183.5 million. The gasoline distribution contribution to product margin was up $5.9 million to $120.8 million primarily due to higher fuel margins and an increase in volumes sold due to our 2022 acquisitions. Fuel margins increased $0.01 per gallon to $0.32 per gallon in the first quarter of 2023 from $0.31 per gallon in the first quarter of 2022. Station operations product margin, which includes convenience stores and prepared food sales, sundries and rental income, increased $4.6 million to $62.7 million from the first quarter of 2022. This reflected an increase in activity in our convenience stores, in part due to our 2022 acquisitions. At the end of the first quarter, our GDSO portfolio consisted of 1,656 sites, comprised of 343 company-operated sites, 297 commission agents, 188 leasing dealers and 828 contract dealers. <br/>Looking at the Wholesale segment. First quarter 2023 product margin increased $6 million to $53.1 million. Gasoline and gasoline blendstock product margin contributed $20.4 million, up $22.7 million from the same period in 2022, primarily reflecting more favorable market conditions year-over-year. Product margin from distillates and other oils decreased $16.7 million to $32.7 million, primarily due to less favorable market conditions in distillates and residual oil, offset by improved margins in crude oil. Warmer weather negatively impacted our weather-sensitive products as temperatures were 16% warmer than normal during the first quarter of 2023 and 13% warmer than the first quarter of 2022. In addition, in the first quarter of last year, we experienced extreme commodity price volatility as a result of the Russian engagement in Ukraine, which benefited the distillate product margin in that period. The improvement in crude oil primarily reflects a decrease in expenses related to the expiry of a pipeline commitment in the fourth quarter of 2022. <br/>Our Commercial segment product margin was flat at $8.1 million in the first quarter of '23 and '22. Looking at expenses. Operating expenses increased $9.1 million to $108.3 million largely associated with our GDSO operations, including our 2022 acquisitions in part due to higher salary and rent expenses and an increase in maintenance and repair expenses. SG&amp;A expenses increased $6 million in the first quarter of '23 to $62.3 million, reflecting increases in wages and benefits and various other expenses, partially offset by a decrease in accrued discretionary incentive compensation. Interest expense was $22.1 million in the first quarter of '23 versus $21.5 million in the same period of 2022 as increased interest rates were partially offset by lower borrowings under our credit facility. CapEx in the first quarter was $15.2 million, consisting of $9.6 million of maintenance CapEx and $5.6 million of expansion CapEx, primarily related to investments in our gasoline station business. <br/>For full year '23, we continue to expect maintenance capital expenditures in the range of $50 million to $60 million and expansion capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, in the range of $55 million to $65 million. relating primarily to investments in our gasoline station business. These current estimates depend in part on timing of completion of projects, availability of equipment and workforce, weather and unanticipated events or opportunities requiring additional maintenance or investments. <br/>Our balance sheet remains strong at 3/31 with leverage, which is defined in our credit agreement as funded debt to EBITDA of approximately 1.75x at the end of the quarter. We continue to have ample excess capacity in our credit facility. As of March 31, 2023, total borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement were $346.3 million. This consisted of $247.3 million under our $950 million working capital revolving credit facility and $99 million under our $600 million revolving credit facility. Adding to our balance sheet strength, this past week, we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement with our bank group. The amendment extends the maturity date from May 2024 to May 2026. The total committed amount of the facilities under the credit agreement remains at $1.55 billion. <br/>Looking ahead on our Investor Relations calendar. On May 23 and May 24, we will be participating in EIC's 20th Annual Energy Infrastructure CEO and Investor Conference. In June, we will be at the Bank of America Energy Credit Conference. For those of you who are participating in this conference, we look forward to seeing you shortly. <br/>Now let me turn back the call to Eric for closing comments. Eric?",
			"<strong>Eric S. Slifka</strong>",
			"Thank you, Greg. We remain focused on driving returns for our stakeholders through a combination of organic growth, operational efficiency and M&amp;A. We're off to a solid start in 2023 and are well positioned to deliver on our strategic objective. Now Greg, Mark and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator?",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Selman Akyol with Stifel.",
			"<strong>Selman Akyol</strong>",
			"Congrats on another nice quarter. Let me just start off. On the Gulf Oil, is this taking longer than you originally anticipated? Or do you have any comments there at all on that when you think this should actually get done?",
			"<strong>Gregory B. Hanson</strong>",
			"Yes, sure. I'll start off, Selman. Good to hear from you. Yes, so I mean it is not taking any longer than we anticipated. I mean I think if you talk to a lot of companies out there, the FTC is taking longer to review a lot of things. We anticipate going into this acquisition that it potentially could be a long acquisition process with the FTC, but we continue to endeavor to work with them and hopeful to get this thing closed as soon as we get the approval from them.",
			"<strong>Selman Akyol</strong>",
			"Got it. Okay. And then turning to your announcement with Exxon, if you could maybe help us understand that a little bit more. I doubt you'll answer me if I ask sort of for pricing or what the investment is. But what I guess I'm really trying to understand is they're going to supply the fuel, you're going to manage the stations. Can you just talk a little bit about how this arrangement is going to be?",
			"<strong>Eric S. Slifka</strong>",
			"Selman, it's Eric. It's really a partnership. If you think about Exxon is good at certain things and Global is good at certain things. I think this is a partnership that will allow us to focus on what our expertise is. And that is operating sites that is pricing sites, that is managing sites. And in terms of supply, look, they are refining behemoth and they're going to -- their job is going to be to supply to locations, right? So we think it's a fit because for us, it puts us in a market that we haven't been in with ExxonMobil. And obviously, we think ExxonMobil is going to be a fantastic partner for the company. And as we've shown in the past, once we end up with assets in markets, we've been able to expand our footprint, right? And so the goal here is operate these assets, get comfortable with the business in Texas and then look to grow it.",
			"<strong>Selman Akyol</strong>",
			"Got it. And then -- I'm sorry, go ahead, please.",
			"<strong>Gregory B. Hanson</strong>",
			"Just on the financial side, I mean it's very much almost an equal partnership. We have a 49.9% interest. They have the majority of the interest, but the investment is very much similar and on the return parameters, we haven't put out any numbers on the actual investment. But I would guide you to that it is in line with our target investment sort of mid-teens, unlevered IRR on a deal like this and very similar to other acquisitions we made in terms of multiples.",
			"<strong>Selman Akyol</strong>",
			"Okay. I do appreciate that. And so then as you think about future expansion in this market, should we look for more of sort of this JV way of growing? Or do you think you would go out and actually more typically go out and buy own lease, manage for other folks that kind of thing.",
			"<strong>Eric S. Slifka</strong>",
			"Yes. We're actively looking to grow the business there. and whether it ends up being a partnership or operated by us, I mean it will be one or the other.",
			"<strong>Selman Akyol</strong>",
			"Got it. Okay. So there's nothing that precludes you from doing something outside of it?",
			"<strong>Eric S. Slifka</strong>",
			"Obviously, they're our partner down there. And so for us, the focus would be to grow with them. But should that not happen, we're prepared to move forward on our own.",
			"<strong>Selman Akyol</strong>",
			"Got it. Okay. And then just pivoting over, just kind of curious any improvement on sort of utilization from EVs where you've installed charges? Are you seeing anything on that front? Anything you can talk about there?",
			"<strong>Eric S. Slifka</strong>",
			"Yes. I think utilization has ticked up and before it was in the low single digits, I'd say that's ticked up anywhere from 6% to 8%. And my view just generally is as more vehicles, electric vehicles come into use, those who have, what I'll call is electric charging stations are going to garner a bigger part of that market. I still think it's difficult that, that utilization rate to make money. That being said, with government support, there's some potential for actual returns out of the business.",
			"<strong>Selman Akyol</strong>",
			"So from that standpoint, as you kind of look forward, do you see adding more charging stations and potentially accessing government funds and all that stuff?",
			"<strong>Eric S. Slifka</strong>",
			"Yes. It's about -- but it's about scale. I mean, you've got you got to do it in a big enough way to move the needle, right? And you're proposing sites to the government, they're releasing funds and then you're building it. So any sort of real impact P&amp;L wise is going to take a little bit, but we have our own riders looking to get and be approved by the government for these funds. So I mean, we're on it, we're after it. It's just going to take a while to scale it up. I think it's still -- yes, I think we're still a little reticent to go after it on our own, right? Because I'm not sure of the returns there, but with government funds, we think there's a return there.",
			"<strong>Selman Akyol</strong>",
			"Got it. And then just commentary in and around the acquisition market, if you'd be so kind.",
			"<strong>Eric S. Slifka</strong>",
			"Yes. It's been very busy. It continues to be busy. We're looking at everything and not just at the states that we're in. But we haven't won every potential deal that's out there, but we do like to see them. And frankly, missing some deals tells me that we're showing good financial discipline. But the deals that we think really fit and we can create value with those are the ones that we're going to hopefully be successful at in the bids.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. Mr. Slifka, now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.",
			"<strong>Eric S. Slifka</strong>",
			"Sure. Thank you for joining us this morning. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. Enjoy the weekend, everybody.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day."

Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!",
			"Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Simply Wall St analysis model here;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://github.com/SimplyWallSt/Company-Analysis-Model/blob/master/MODEL.markdown#discounted-cash-flow-dcf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Simply Wall St analysis model here</a> may be something of interest to you.",

			"We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.",
			"Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:",
			"<i>(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)</i><br/><strong>Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF)</strong> = CA$56b",
			"The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.8%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 11%.",
			"<strong>Terminal Value (TV)</strong>= FCF<sub>2032</sub> × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = CA$11b× (1 + 1.8%) ÷ (11%– 1.8%) = CA$118b",
			"<strong>Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)</strong>= TV / (1 + r)<sup>10</sup>= CA$118b÷ ( 1 + 11%)<sup>10</sup>= CA$41b",
			"The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is CA$97b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of CA$53.2, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.",
			"We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Enbridge as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.559. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.",

			"<strong>Opportunity</strong>",
			"<strong>Threat</strong>",
			"Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Enbridge, there are three important aspects you should assess:",

			"<strong>Lance Casson:</strong> Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Canadian Natural's first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. As always, before we begin, I'd like to remind you of our forward-looking statements, and it should be noted that in our reporting disclosures everything is in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated, and we report our reserves and production before royalties. Additionally, I would suggest you review our comments on non-GAAP disclosures in our financial statements. With me this morning is Tim McKay, our President; and Mark Stainthorpe, our Chief Financial Officer. Tim will first speak to how Canadian Natural is a leader on environmental, social and governance, followed by specifics on our safe, reliable, world-class operations, including details on targeted production growth from our long life low decline assets to generate strong returns on capital and maximize shareholder value.",

			"<strong>Tim McKay:</strong> Good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we achieved strong quarterly production of approximately 1.32 million BOEs per day including record natural gas production at approximately 2.14 Bcf per day and liquids productions of approximately 963,000 barrels a day, reflecting strong operational performance across our assets, including our long life, zero-decline well and mining upgrading assets, comprising approximately 50% of the total company's liquids production this quarter. Our high-value SCO captured approximately a $2 premium to WTI in the quarter, driving strong SCO pricing and generating significant free cash for the company. Canadian Natural is the leader in environmental, social governance and has made it a priority to our collaborative with industry peers and governments to achieve meaningful GHG emission reduction in support of both Alberta and Canada's chronicles.",
			"The Alberta government's recently announced emission reduction and energy development plan built upon the province long-standing climate leadership and achievements and emissions reduction. We look forward to supporting the province and continuing to provide affordable, reliable, responsibly produced energy, while reducing emissions and aspiring towards a net-zero economy in 2050. Canadian Natural's current GHG goals support Alberta's client plan where large-scale carbon capture and storage projects like pathways have a significant role in reducing GHG emissions. Moving to the assets. I'll now do a brief overview. Overall, in Q1 2023, natural gas production was approximately 2.14 Bcf, which was a record for the company, a 7% increase over Q1 2022.",
			"For North American operations, Q1 2023, natural gas production was strong at approximately 2.13 Bcf per day, an increase of approximately 139 million cubic feet over Q1 2022, primarily as a result of the company's strategic decision to invest in our drill-to-fill strategy, adding low-cost, high-value liquids-rich natural gas production volumes. During the quarter, the company drilled 21 net wells, of which 19 were brought on in the quarter, meeting targeted rates. As well during the quarter, our third party pipeline impacted both natural gas by about 33 million a day and associated liquids of approximately 3,500 barrels per day. For Q1, North American natural gas operating cost was $1.43, which is up 12% compared to Q1 2022 of $1.28. Our teams continue to focus on operational excellence and cost control.",
			"Our North American light oil and NGLs Q1 production was 108,531 barrels per day, comparable to Q1 2022, primarily a result of strong drilling results. Q1 operating costs were $18.62 per barrel, up from Q1 2022 operating cost of $15.24 per barrel, primarily due to increased power and service costs in the quarter. During the quarter, we drilled 16 net wells as part of our light oil development plan, which targeted to come on production in both Q2 and Q3 of this year. At Wembley, the company finished drilling a five well light oil -- a 5-well light oil pad late in Q1, which is targeted to come on May 15, with initial production rates of approximately 4,000 barrels a day of liquids and 14 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. This pad is part of the company's budgeted 11 well program in the greater Wembley area.",
			"Our international assets in Q1 2023 had oil production of 27,331 barrels a day, which is down from Q1 2022 levels of approximately 31,000 barrels a day, primarily due to the decline in maintenance in North Sea and Offshore Africa. International assets continue to generate good free cash flow and value for the company. Moving to heavy oil, production was 77,690 barrels a day in Q1 2023, up 23% from Q1 2022, primarily due to strong drilling results in 2022. Operating costs in Q1 2023 were $21.47 per barrel comparable to our Q1 2022 operating cost of $22 per barrel. During the quarter, the company drilled 42 net heavy oil wells, of which 26 wells were multilateral wells across our land base from Bonnyville, Lloydminster to the Clearwater area with production results on target and budget.",
			"A key component of our long-life, low-decline assets is our world-class Pelican pool, where our leading-edge polymer flood continues to deliver significant value. Q1 production was 48,244 barrels a day, down 7% and Q1 2022 average of 51,991 barrels a day, reflecting the decline nature of the property. Polymer injection rates were reinstated in February 2023, and the field is targeted to return to its historical decline rate of approximately 5% in the second half of 2023. The team continues to focus on mitigating cost pressures and we had a good Q1 2023 operating cost of $9.63 per barrel, an increase from our Q2 2022 operating cost of $748 per barrel, primarily due to high power costs in the quarter. With our low decline and very low operating cost, Pelican Lake continues to have excellent netbacks.",
			"In our thermal in situ operations in Q1, we continue to leverage our continuous improvement culture and our expertise to deliver effective and efficient operations. Q1 2023 production was 242,884 barrels a day, down from Q1 production -- Q1 2022 production of 261,743 barrels as forecasted as a result of natural decline. Q1 2023 operating costs were $15.94 per barrel upwards comparing to Q1 2022 operating costs of $14.35 per barrel, primarily a result of higher power costs and service costs, offset by lower natural gas costs. I'll now update on our thermal growth plan. At Primrose, the company is targeting to grow production by approximately 25,000 barrels a day from Q4 2022 to Q4 2023 levels, primarily from its results of the two CCS pads drilled in 2022.",
			"The first production cycle from these pads is targeted to begin in Q3 2023, which targets strong quarterly production at Primrose of approximately 100,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter of this year. At Kirby, the company is targeting to grow production by approximately 15,000 barrels a day from Q4 2022 levels to approximately 65,000 barrels a day in Q4 2023 as the company progressed its development of four SAGD paths in 2023. Production from the first pad drilled in 2022 as targeted ramp-up full production capacity in Q3 2023. The three remaining pads are targeted to round up to full production cuts over the first nine months of 2024 at a pace of one pad per quarter. At Jackfish, the production has been very strong, averaging approximately 115,000 barrels a day with minimal capital since acquiring the asset, representing its long-life motto decline nature.",
			"The company is currently drilling two SAGD pads. Production from these pads is targeted to ramp up to full production capacities in Q3 of 2024 and Q4 of 2024, respectively supporting our continued high utilization at that facility. Subsequent to the quarter end, the company commenced planned turnarounds of Primrose East and Wolf Lake, which targets to impact Q2 2023 production from by approximately 15,000 barrels a day and are reflected in the company's previous announced annual production guidance. The thermal and so production is targeted to increase in the second half of 2023 into 2024 and with new pads that were drilled in 2022 and pads targeted to finish drilling in the first half of 2023. Production is targeted to grow by approximately 30,000 barrels a day from Q4 to -- Q4 2022 to Q4 2023, averaging approximately 280,000 barrels a day.",
			"And with the strip of WCS differential tightening this could add incremental cash flow. In the company's world-class oil sands mining and upgrading assets, we had a Q1 production of approximately exactly 4,228 barrels a day of SCO with Q1 2023 operating costs that were $25.06 per barrel. During the quarter, SCO prices were strong, resulting in premium pricing for SCO at approximately US$2 per barrel above WTI adding additional cash flows. Subsequent to Q1 2023, as previously announced, the planned turnaround activities on the non-operated stocker began April 10, with the mines targeted to operate at reduced rates for approximately 73 days impacting the 2023 annual production by approximately 8,300 barrels a day. For Horizon, the plant turnaround is targeted to begin May 16 with a full plant outage, targeting for approximately 28 days impacting the 2023 annual production by approximately 21,600 barrels a day.",
			"At Horizon, the 14.4 reliability enhancement project is progressing as planned and tie-ins are targeted to be complete during the turnaround. This project targets to extend major turnaround maintenance cycles from one per year to one every second year, increasing SCO production capacity by approximately 5,000 barrels a day in 2023, increasing to approximately 14,000 barrels a day in 2025. I will now turn it over to Mark for a financial review.",
			"<strong>Mark Stainthorpe:</strong> Thanks, Tim. In the first quarter of 2023, we generated solid financial results with adjusted funds flow of CAD 3.4 billion and adjusted net earnings from operations of CAD 1.9 billion. This drove material free cash flow in the quarter of CAD 1.4 billion after dividends and base capital. Balanced allocation to our four pillars continues, including significant returns to shareholders in the quarter and year-to-date up to including May 3, 2023, year-to-date returns to shareholders totaled CAD 2.8 billion, including CAD 1.9 billion in dividends and CAD 0.9 billion in share repurchases. Our commitment to increasing shareholder returns is evident in our sustainable and growing quarterly dividend, which was increased to CAD 0.90 per share from CAD 0.85 per share in March 2023 and marking 2023 as the 23rd consecutive year of dividend increases.",
			"Subsequent to quarter end, the Board has declared a quarterly dividend of CAD 0.90 per share payable on July 5, 2023. As debt levels have decreased significantly over the last few years, returns to shareholders are targeted to increase in the near term as our free cash flow allocation policy states that once net debt reaches that CAD 10 billion level, a 100% of free cash flow will be allocated to shareholder returns. We are in a very strong financial position with debt to EBITDA at 0.5 times at the end of Q1 2023, and we continue to maintain strong liquidity. Including revolving bank facilities, cash and short-term investments, liquidity at the end of Q1 2023 was approximately CAD 6.1 billion. At Canadian Natural, we have several competitive advantages, including our diverse long-life low decline production, supported by our large high-value reserves and effective and efficient operations.",
			"This, combined with our people, culture, and commitment to continuous improvement targets to continue to drive material free cash flow and strong returns on capital going forward. With that, I'll turn it back to you, Tim, for some final comments.",
			"<strong>Tim McKay:</strong> Canadian Natural's advantage is our ability to effectively allocate cash flow to our four pillars, and we have a well-balanced, diverse, large asset base with a significant portion long-life, low-decline assets, which require less maintenance capital to maintain volumes. We will continue to allocate cash flow to our four pillars in a disciplined manner to maximize value for our shareholders which all is driven by effective capital allocation, effective and efficient operations and by our teams who deliver top-tier run. We have a robust, sustainable free cash flow. And through our free cash flow allocation policy returns to shareholders are significant. Our dividend was increased by 13% in March marking 2023 as the 23rd year of consecutive increases and has a CAGR of approximately 21% over that time.",
			"In summary, we will continue to focus on safe, reliable operations, enhancing our top-tier operations and will continue to drive environmental performance. We're in a strong position and being nimble enhances our capacity to create value for our shareholders. We will continue to apply the same drive to ESG governance social and environment, a significant factor in our long-term sustainability. As we move forward to lower our carbon emissions, with our first target to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 40% by 2035 from our 2020 baseline on our journey to achieve our goal of net GHG in the oil sands by 2050. Canadian Natural is delivering top-tier free cash flow generation, which is unique, sustainable, robust and clearly demonstrates our ability to both economically grow the business and deliver returns to shareholders by balancing our four pillars.",

			"<strong>Operator:</strong> Welcome to the First Quarter 2023 ConocoPhillips Earnings Conference Call. My name is Michelle, and I will be your operator for today's call. . I will now turn the call over to Phil Gresh, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.",
			"<strong>Phil Gresh:</strong> Thank you, Michelle, and welcome to everyone to our first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. On the call today are several members of the ConocoPhillips leadership team, including Ryan Lance, Chairman and CEO; Bill Bullock, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dominic Macklon, Executive Vice President of Strategy, Sustainability and Technology; Nick Olds, Executive President of Lower 48; Andy O'Brien, Senior Vice President of Global Operations; and Tim Leach, advisor to the CEO. Ryan and Bill will kick off the call with opening remarks, after which the team will be available for your questions. A few quick reminders. First, along with today's release, we published supplemental financial materials and a slide presentation, which you can find on the Investor Relations website; second, during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements based on current expectations.",
			"Actual results may differ due to factors noted in today's release and in our periodic SEC filings. Finally, we will make reference to some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in today's release and on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Ryan.",
			"<strong>Ryan Lance :</strong> Thanks, Phil, and thank you to everyone for joining our first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Since we just hosted our Analyst Day and Investor Meeting in New York a few weeks ago, we are going to keep our prepared remarks fairly brief today. ConocoPhillips delivered a strong first quarter result, setting a new production record for the company as well as in the Lower 48. Underlying production growth was 4% year-on-year, including 8% year-on-year growth in the Lower 48. We are confident in our outlook for the rest of the year, and we are increasing the midpoint of our full year production guidance. We're keeping our full year capital and operating guidance unchanged. Shifting to returns on announced capital, we continue to demonstrate our returns-focused value proposition in the first quarter.",
			"Our return on capital employed once again exceeded our goal of being top quartile in the S&amp;P 500. And as we highlighted at the recent Analyst and Investor Meeting, we remain confident in our ability to achieve this objective in a mid-cycle price environment over the course of our 10-year plan. On return of capital, we are on track to deliver on our planned $11 billion for 2023, which represents greater than 50% of our projected CFO and is highly competitive with peers. And we are able to achieve all of this while investing in our attractive mid- and long-term opportunities. Our first quarter was also quite busy from a strategic perspective. At Port Arthur LNG, we acquired a 30% equity interest in the joint venture upon final investment decision on Phase 1.",
			"At Willow, we are pleased to receive a positive record of decision and began road construction. And at APLNG, we announced plans to become upstream operator following the closing of EIG's transaction with Origin and to purchase up to an additional 2.49% in the project. We also accelerated our 2030 greenhouse gas emissions intensity reduction target to 50% to 60% versus a 2016 baseline as we further advance our net zero operational emissions ambition. I know everyone has the question on Surmont, so let me address that right now. We acknowledge that we received our right of first refusal notice, and we're certainly reviewing it carefully. Now in conclusion, as we shared at our Analyst and Investor Meeting last month, our deep, durable and diversified asset base is well positioned to generate solid returns in cash flow for decades to come.",
			"And as I said then, we challenge any other E&amp;P company to show you a plan with this kind of duration. Now let me turn the call over to Bill to cover our first quarter performance in more detail.",

			"<strong>William Bullock :</strong> Well, thanks, Ryan. In the first quarter of 2023, we generated $2.38 per share in adjusted earnings. First quarter production was a record for the company at 1,792,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, driven by solid execution across the entire portfolio. The Eagle Ford stabilized our expansion and QatarGas 3 planned turnarounds were both successfully completed. And Lower 48 production was also a record, averaging 1,036,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, including 694,000 from the Permian; 227,000 from the Eagle Ford; 98,000 from the Bakken. And Lower 48's underlying production grew 8% year-on-year with new wells online and strong well performance relative to our expectations across our asset base. Now moving to cash flows.",
			"First quarter CFO was $5.7 billion, excluding working capital at an average WTI price of $76 per barrel. This included APLNG distributions of $764 million. Now first quarter capital expenditures were $2.9 billion, including $400 million for Port Arthur Phase 1 and $100 million in Lower 48 acquisitions. Regarding Port Arthur, as you will recall from our fourth quarter call, we said we plan to spend about $1.1 billion in 2023. So first quarter spending was very front-end loaded relative to the full year. In the first quarter, we also received $200 million in disposition proceeds. And regarding capital allocation, we returned $3.2 billion back to shareholders. And this was via $1.7 billion in share buybacks and $1.5 billion in ordinary dividends and VROC payments.",
			"Turning to guidance. We forecast second quarter production to be in a range of 1.77 million to 1.81 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. This includes 10,000 to 15,000 of planned seasonal turnarounds. We have also increased the midpoint of our full year production guidance by 10,000 barrels a day. Our new range is 1.78 million to 1.8 million barrels of oil equivalent, up from 1.7 million to 1.8 million previously. For APLNG, we expect distributions of 350 million to 400 million in the second quarter. And for the full year, we expect APLNG distributions of 1.8 billion. All other guided items remain unchanged. So to wrap up, we had a strong first quarter. We remain confident in our outlook, leading to our increase in full year production guidance.",
			"And we expect to return $11 billion to our shareholders this year. And we're well positioned to deliver on our commitments throughout this year. So that concludes our prepared remarks. And now I'll turn the call back over to Phil.",
			"<strong>Phil Gresh :</strong> Great. Thanks, Bill. So before we move to Q&amp;A, just a quick reminder here that we are sticking to one question per caller this quarter, since we just hosted the Analyst Day a few weeks ago, and it’s obviously quite a busy earnings day for everybody. So with that, Michelle, let's move to the Q&amp;A.",

			"<span><strong>Exxon Mobil</strong> shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+15.6% vs. +3.5%) on the back of the company's bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure that has historically produced industry-leading returns make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play.</span><br/>",
			"<span>The firm has made more than 30 discoveries in offshore Guyana since 2015. ExxonMobil also has a strong presence in the prolific Permian Basin, where it delivered record production in 2022. Also, a strong presence in chemicals and refining operations is noteworthy.</span><br/>",

The discount retailer’s key strengths are strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives, and an emphasis on membership growth.</span><br/>",

			"<span><strong>Activision Blizzard</strong> shares have outperformed the Zacks Toys - Games - Hobbies industry over the past six months (+5.0% vs. +1.6%), though the stock has lost ground lately following unfavorable regulatory action on its Microsoft deal out of the U.K. </span>",
			"<span>Activision’s first-quarter 2023 earnings and revenues increased year-over-year. First-quarter growth was broad-based, with net bookings increasing year-over-year in Call of Duty, Candy Crush, Warcraft, Overwatch, and Diablo. Call of Duty in-game net bookings on console and PC grew strongly year-over-year in the first quarter.</span><br/>",
			"<span>The Zacks analyst believes that Diablo Immortal on mobile and PC also contributed to Blizzard’s first-quarter net bookings growth. Candy Crush payer numbers again grew year-over-year, and Candy Crush was the top-grossing game franchise in the U.S. app stores for the 23rd quarter in a row.</span><br/>",

			"<strong>TC Energy</strong> TRP reported first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of 89 cents per share, which is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line marginally increased from the year-ago quarter’s profit of 88 cents.",
			"The company reported comparable EBITDA of about C$2.77 billion compared with C$2.39 billion in the prior-year period.",
			"Revenues of $2.90 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.73 billion. The figure also increased 5.1% year over year. This outperformance could be attributed to the strong results of the Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines, Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines, and Power and Storage segments.",
			"TRP’s board of directors announced a quarterly dividend of 93 Canadian cents per common share for the quarter ending Jun 30, 2023. The dividend is payable on Jul 31, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of the business on Jun 30, 2022.",
			"TC Energy Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | TC Energy Corporation Quote",
			"<strong>Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines</strong> reported a comparable EBITDA of C$740 million, up 14.9% from the year-ago quarter’s level. This increase was largely due to the impact of higher flow-through costs on Canadian rate-regulated pipelines and increased rate-base earnings on the NGTL System.",
			"<strong>U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines’</strong> comparable EBITDA of C$1.3 billion reflects an 8.3% increase from the prior-year quarter’s recorded number. This upside was due to higher earnings from ANR following the FERC-approved settlement for an increase in transportation rates, effective August 2022. The improvement can also be attributed to growth projects placed in service, and higher realized earnings related to the U.S. natural gas marketing business, partially offset by higher operational costs.",
			"<strong>Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines </strong>reported comparable EBITDA of C$172 million, up 16.2% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of C$148 million. The upside was primarily due to the north section of the Villa de Reyes pipeline (VdR North) and the east section of the Tula pipeline (Tula East) that were placed into commercial service in the third quarter of 2022. This was partially offset by an equity income loss from Sur de Texas primarily due to peso-denominated financial exposure.",
			"The<strong> Liquids Pipelines </strong>unit’s comparable EBITDA of C$317 million deteriorated from the prior-year quarter’s level of C$329 million. This downtrend can be attributed to lower uncontracted volumes in the Keystone Pipeline System in relation to the Milepost 14 incident.  It was also due to lower rates and volumes on the U.S. Gulf Coast section of the pipeline, partially offset by higher long-haul contracted volumes from the 2019 Open Season that were commercialized in 2022.",
			"<strong>Power and Storage</strong> registered a comparable EBITDA of C$281 million, up 79% from the year-ago quarter’s level of C$157 million. The uptrend was due to increased contributions from Bruce Power due to a higher contract price and fewer planned outage days. This was partially offset by realized losses on funds invested for post-retirement benefits, as well as increased earnings from Canadian Power due to higher realized power prices.",
			"As of Mar 31, 2023, TC Energy’s capital investments amounted to C$3.03 billion.",
			"TRP had cash and cash equivalents worth C$3.85 billion and long-term debt of C$46.25 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 57.2%.",
			"The company expects to spend C$34 billion on capital programs in 2023. It continues to anticipate capital spending in the range of C$11.5-C$12.0 billion for the same year. Common share dividend is projected at an annual rate of 3-5%.",
			"TC Energy projects 700 MMcf/d of additional market access with an incremental 500 MMcf/d in the second quarter of 2023.",
			"It expects comparable EBITDA growth of 5-7% in 2023, with higher earnings per common share.",
			"Bruce Power Unit 3 will be removed from service on Mar 1, 2023, to begin its Major Component Replacement outage. A return to service is expected in 2026.",

The oil and gas company has reported impressive numbers due to soaring energy prices. It is a global energy business that explores and produces oil and gas. Additionally, it operates midstream assets like processing plants and pipelines which aid its core business. Despite the recent decline in oil prices, the company managed to report better-than-expected numbers. It has raised its dividend distribution for 36 consecutive years.",

One solid reason to bet on this company is its integrated business model which shows long-term potential. The company will have very favorable conditions for its oil and refined products in the near-term, and demand is only going to grow. After the surprise production cut announced by <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:OPEC+;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/sarabia-other-opec-producers-announce-voluntary-oil-output-cuts-2023-04-02/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">OPEC+</a> in April, the global supply of oil should be limited, driving prices higher, corresponding to profit increases for Chevron.",

			"Currently, LII stock is trading around $281 per share, up 27% over the past year and 17% year-to-date. Despite the market rout in 2022, LII stock has continued to outperform. Notably, the company’s shares are much lower than their all-time high of $350, suggesting potential upside on the horizon.",

Further, its net income stood at $98.0 million and Lennox’s cash balance at the end of the quarter was $48 million.",

In 2022, the company saw 11% year-over-year growth in snack sales, driving an impressive 18th consecutive year of dividend growth. Indeed, Kellogg is a highly reliable dividend stock to add to your portfolio, considering the business has held strong despite recent market uncertainty.",
			"Kellogg has a number of brands that drive profitability for the business and it has even managed to handle the inflation-led price bumps well. The spinoff has put the company in a strong financial position and the move could pay off in the long-term.

			"Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?",
			"Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about <b>Enterprise Products Partners</b> (EPD) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.",
			"Enterprise Products currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.29, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.",
			"Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 12 are Strong Buy, representing 85.7% of all recommendations.",
			"<b>Brokerage Recommendation Trends for EPD</b>",
			"<br/><br/>Check price target &amp; stock forecast for Enterprise Products here&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/><br/>The ABR suggests buying Enterprise Products, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.",
			"Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.",
			"This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.",
			"With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.",
			"<b>Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR</b>",
			"Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.",
			"The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.",
			"It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.",
			"In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.",
			"Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.",
			"Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.",
			"<b>Is EPD a Good Investment?</b>",
			"Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Enterprise Products, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 3.1% over the past month to $2.58.",
			"Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.",
			"The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Enterprise Products. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;",

			"While investors closely watch year-over-year changes in headline numbers -- revenue and earnings -- and how they compare to Wall Street expectations to determine their next course of action, some key metrics always provide a better insight into a company's underlying performance.",
			"As these metrics influence top- and bottom-line performance, comparing them to the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated helps investors project a stock's price performance more accurately.",
			"Here is how ConocoPhillips performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:",

			"<strong>Suncor Energy</strong> SU is set to release first-quarter results on May 8. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 93 cents per share on revenues of $7.8 billion.<br/><br/>Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the Canadian energy giant’s performance in the March quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at SU’s previous-quarter performance first.",
			"In the last reported quarter, this Calgary, Alberta-based operator beat the consensus mark on the back of significantly higher crude oil and refined product realizations. SU had reported earnings per share of $1.33, 7 cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues of $10.2 billion generated by the firm also came in above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.7 billion.<br/><br/>SU beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, which resulted in an earnings surprise of 11.6%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:<br/>",
			"Suncor Energy Inc. price-eps-surprise | Suncor Energy Inc. Quote",
			" ",
			"The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter bottom line has remained unchanged in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 38.8% drop year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, meanwhile, suggests a 27% decrease from the year-ago period.",
			"SU is expected to have reaped the reward of higher crude oil processed during the period. Despite softening from the spectacular highs of last year, the overall positive momentum in the refining space is most likely to have continued in the first quarter, thanks to the strength in fuel demand. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Suncor Energy’s daily crude oil processing volume is pegged at 451 thousand barrels, up more than 3% from the prior-year quarter’s level. This is likely to have buoyed the first-quarter results of SU.<br/><br/>On a somewhat bearish note, the increase in SU’s costs might have dented the company’s to-be-reported bottom line. The company’s fourth-quarter operating expenses totaled C$10.3 billion, up from the C$9.1 billion incurred in the year-ago period. The upward cost trajectory is likely to have continued in the first quarter due to the prevailing inflationary environment.",
			"The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that SU is likely to beat estimates in the first quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates. But that’s not the case here.<br/><br/>You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br/><br/><strong>Earnings ESP:</strong> Suncor Energy has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 93 cents per share each.<br/><br/><strong>Zacks Rank:</strong> SU currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult this earnings season.",
			"While an earnings beat looks uncertain for Suncor, here are some firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model:<br/><br/><strong>BellRing Brands, Inc.</strong> BRBR has an Earnings ESP of +1.38% and a Zacks Rank #2. The firm is scheduled to release earnings on May 8.<br/><br/>You can see <strong>the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br/><br/>BellRing Brands beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters.

The firm is scheduled to release earnings on May 9.<br/><br/>Blink Charging beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 3.6%, on average. Valued at around $438 million, BLNK has lost 62% in a year.<br/><br/><strong>Occidental Petroleum</strong> OXY has an Earnings ESP of +0.09% and a Zacks Rank #3. The firm is scheduled to release earnings on May 9.<br/><br/>Occidental Petroleum’s expected EPS growth rate for three to five years is currently 22%, which compares favorably with the industry's growth rate of 21.8%.

			"<b>Chevron</b> (CVX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.",
			"Over the past month, shares of this oil company have returned -6.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry, which Chevron falls in, has lost 6.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?",
			"Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.",
			"<b>Earnings Estimate Revisions</b>",
			"Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.",
			"We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.",
			"Chevron is expected to post earnings of $3.57 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -38.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.7%.",
			"The consensus earnings estimate of $14.39 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -23.6%. This estimate has changed -1.2% over the last 30 days.",
			"For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.50 indicates a change of +7.7% from what Chevron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.9%.",
			"Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Chevron is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",
			"The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:",
			"<b>12 Month EPS</b>",
			"<b>Projected Revenue Growth</b>",
			"Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.",
			"In the case of Chevron, the consensus sales estimate of $52.34 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -23.9%. The $208.91 billion and $217.03 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -15.2% and +3.9%, respectively.",
			"<b>Last Reported Results and Surprise History</b>",
			"Chevron reported revenues of $50.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6.6%. EPS of $3.55 for the same period compares with $3.36 a year ago.",
			"Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $47.93 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.98%. The EPS surprise was +5.65%.",
			"Over the last four quarters, Chevron surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.",
			"<b>Valuation</b>",
			"Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.",
			"Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.",
			"As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.",
			"Chevron is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.",
			"<b>Conclusion</b>",
			"The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Chevron. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.",

			"As more drilling and mining projects are approved in Alaska, local trucking fleets are planning to hire drivers around the United States to haul equipment, chemicals and other loads — particularly on its fearsome Dalton Highway, a remote, 414-mile road that connects Fairbanks to oil fields near the Arctic Ocean.",
			"The developments, particularly <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:ConocoPhillips Alaska’s Willow project;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alaska-oil-drilling-biden-environment-climate-c39147c8ae1797aab9cb27219bf92675\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ConocoPhillips Alaska’s Willow project</a>, have been controversial as they may mar some of Earth’s most remote land. However, for the residents of the United States’ third-least-populated state, the new investments could bring an economic boom that many locals say the state needs.",
			"The construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System in the 1970s and oil boom of the 1980s transformed Alaska. The pipeline brought in <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:some 70,000 workers;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://aoghs.org/transportation/trans-alaska-pipeline/#:~:text=The%20pipeline%20project%20involved%20some,laid%20on%20March%2027%2C%201975.\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">some 70,000 workers</a> and often their families. Many of them stayed; Alaska’s population grew three times as fast as the rest of the country in the 1970s and 1980s. <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:As of 2013,;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://laborstats.alaska.gov/trends/dec13art3.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">As of 2013,</a> more than half of Alaska’s housing stock was built in those decades.",
			"Josh Norum, the president of Fairbanks-based Sourdough Express, said the impending explosion in mining and drilling could rival those frothy years.",
			"“We’re calling it our second pipeline,” Norum said. “(The Trans-Alaska Pipeline) was a huge boom. … We’re comparing that opportunity with this next phase.”",
			"In response, Alaskan trucking companies are searching for truck drivers to haul equipment — and they’re paying them massive salaries.",
			"<br/>",
			"Drivers who can tackle the so-called haul road, which is packed with ice in the winter and prone to dust and mud the other three seasons, are in particular demand.",
			"Norum said Sourdough Express drivers on the haul road earn $95,000 to $120,000, in addition to health care, retirement and paid time off benefits. Compensation has increased by 15% over the past two years.",
			"Sourdough Express currently employs 85 company drivers in addition to contractors, Norum said, adding that over the next few years the company will add 50 to 100 new drivers.",
			"Gage Schutte, vice president of freight operations for Alaska West Express, also said the company is looking to add 50 to 100 new drivers to its fleet. According to a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:federal database;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://safer.fmcsa.dot.gov/query.asp?searchtype=ANY&amp;query_type=queryCarrierSnapshot&amp;query_param=USDOT&amp;original_query_param=NAME&amp;query_string=222&amp;original_query_string=ALASKA%20WEST%20EXPRESS%20INC\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">federal database</a>, the company currently has 121 drivers.",
			"Alaska West Express increased driver compensation by 11% this year. Each round trip between Fairbanks and Prudhoe Bay on the haul road pays around $1,500, Schutte said. Drivers can expect to make 100 to 115 trips to Prudhoe a year. That means Alaska West Express drivers can earn around $150,000 to $170,000 a year, in addition to benefits.",
			"That might be enticing for truck drivers who are struggling with slumping freight volumes and looking for a well-paid gig. Thousands of trucking authorities have already shut down this year as <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:gigs available for drivers dry up;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/trucking-bloodbath-snares-fleets-large-and-small\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gigs available for drivers dry up</a>. According to federal data, tractor-trailer drivers earn a median annual wage of <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:around $48,000;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/transportation-and-material-moving/heavy-and-tractor-trailer-truck-drivers.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">around $48,000</a>.",
			"However, these aren’t easy jobs. The best conditions on the haul road are in the winter, when temperatures in the negative 20s give the ice-packed highway its best traction. Fall and spring make the road slushy, while summertime means the haul road is dusty or slick with calcium that’s used to make it <em>less </em>dusty.",
			"Robb Christenson, the director of sales and pricing at Sourdough Express, was a truck driver around his native Alaska for nearly three decades, including some 50 runs on the haul road. He said those loads weren’t easy, but hauling chemicals and heavy equipment near the Arctic Circle was certainly memorable.",
			"“The equipment that you haul you’ve never seen before in your life,” Christenson said. “Being a part of that and doing that, it means something special as well.”",
			"Safety is the most important feature for these trucking executives. Those at Alaska West and Sourdough said they prefer to hire Alaskan residents. However, there’s such a demand for truck drivers now that they’ll likely have to recruit from the lower 48.",
			"Schutte said few truck drivers who apply to these haul road driving positions already have haul road experience. Some are able to catch on quicker — for example, those with log trucking experience in the Pacific Northwest.",
			"Jeff Russell, who is the superintendent of maintenance of operations in the Alaska Department of Transportation’s Dalton district, which includes the haul road, can concur that running on this road isn’t for everyone. Drivers stuck in a snowdrift might not be able to get rescued for a day or more. And they’ll need to know how to fix their own trucks — tow trucks aren’t exactly heading up to Prudhoe on a whim.",
			"“Trying to find personnel that’s willing to take on that challenge is unique,” Russell said, “not just for those who need to maintain the road but for the trucking community who needs to have people that are willing to drive in those conditions. They’re not a dime a dozen. I can tell you that.”",
			"Alaska has a complex history with energy exploration and production. The state has long been highly dependent on diesel fuel for heating, transportation and power generation. Fuel is expensive to import.",
			"Oil production drove Alaska’s economic growth in the 20th century. The 1977 completion of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which has a carrying capacity of 2.1 million barrels per day (bpd), unlocked more oil production but also depleted Alaska’s oil reserves. Production on Alaska’s North Slope peaked in 1988 at just over 2 million bpd and has fallen more than 75% since then.",
			"Alaska’s oil production has been slowly declining for the past 10 years. Before that, there were two more punctuated periods of sharper decline, from 1988 to 1998 when crude oil production was cut in half from 2 million bpd to 1 million bpd, and another decline from 2004 to about 2011.",
			"Today, the question is whether Alaskan oil production is poised for a rebound that would see it retake the 500,000 bpd mark — approximately 25% of the state’s 1988 peak.",
			"Alaska’s oil production, when multiplied by the price of oil, helps determine the payout amounts for the <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Alaska Permanent Fund;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://alaskapublic.org/2023/05/02/alaska-senate-approves-new-permanent-fund-dividend-payout-formula-but-final-action-remains-distant/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Alaska Permanent Fund</a>, the annual oil and gas dividend that every person who’s lived in Alaska for longer than 12 months is eligible to receive. That payout has bounced between $1,000 and $2,000 annually, but could see a resurgence if Alaska pumps more barrels in a rich price environment.",
			"According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Alaska North Slope crude fetched $76.62 per barrel in January, a price that was down from recent peaks but still very high compared to the 1980s to 2000s.",
			"The $8 billion ConocoPhillips Willow project, approved by the Biden administration in mid-March, represents the largest investment in Alaska energy infrastructure in decades and is projected to produce as much as 200,000 bpd over the next 30 years. ConocoPhillips did not respond to a FreightWaves request for comment.",
			"Oil production on the North Slope could grow by 40%, and ConocoPhillips officials have said that the Willow project’s wells could be used to develop newly discovered fields farther west.",
			"Another project on the North Slope, a joint venture by Australian firm Oil Search and Spain’s Repsol, will invest $2.6 billion to develop the Pikka project, forecast to produce 120,000 bpd by 2026.",
			"While that kind of production growth would have a significant positive impact on the Alaska Permanent Fund payouts to everyday Alaskans, a  renaissance of Alaska’s oil and gas industry would immediately spike demand for construction, oilfield services and transportation jobs in the remote, frigid North Slope, likely raising wages significantly.",
			"Other projects may contribute to that boom as well. A <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:proposed gold mine in southwest Alaska;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/mining/large-mines/donlin/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">proposed gold mine in southwest Alaska</a> would take three to four years to construct and operate for about 27 years. It would employ hundreds of workers each year.",
			"Alaskan lawmakers, the oil industry, labor unions, trades, Alaska Native groups and some North Slope residents have all rallied behind the Willow project, <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:as The New York Times reported;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/12/climate/biden-willow-arctic-drilling-restrictions.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">as The New York Times reported</a>.",
			"Climate activists, however, have slammed it as a “carbon bomb.” Burning all of the oil the Willow project would produce would equal 9.2 million metric tons of carbon pollution annually, or 2 million additional cars. Meanwhile, some Alaska Natives say the proposed gold mine could endanger their access to fish and game resources.",

Our first quarter results were right in line with our expectations despite extreme volatility in both financial and commodity markets. Operationally, we continue to be a first-choice service provider to our customers and during the quarter, this resulted in high utilization across our systems and record volumes on the Mainline. Enbridge is very proud of its long history of predictable financial and operational performance. For 17 consecutive years, shareholders have benefited from our ability to consistently meet financial guidance and we have delivered 28 consecutive annual dividend increases.",
			"\"The agreement in principle on a negotiated settlement on the Mainline is a win-win-win for us, our customers and the markets we serve. The new settlement builds on 27 years of incentive tolling arrangements and keeps us aligned with our customers to maximize throughput and maintain first-choice service standards, while continuing to grow the system as needed. Under the agreement in principle, it is expected that Enbridge will earn attractive risk-adjusted within a Return-On-Equity (ROE) performance collar which provides downside protection in the event of supply or demand disruptions or unforeseen cost exposure, a feature that did not exist in the previous Competitive Tolling Settlement. The new toll also provides inflationary adjustments based on the U.S. consumer price index and power indices.",
			"\"We continue to grow both our conventional and lower-carbon businesses. We are pleased to have started the year by adding to our secured growth backlog, which sits at <span class=\"xn-money\">$17 billion</span> and securing a number of high-quality acquisitions at attractive multiples.",
			"\"On the conventional side, we executed a strategic tuck-in acquisition of the Aitken Creek natural gas storage facility expanding our LNG-related footprint in B.C. We also received strong customer interest from our open season to support transporting much-needed natural gas out of the Appalachia region. On the Gulf Coast, we sanctioned the Enbridge Houston Oil Terminal which will strengthen our full-path service offering and furthers our world-class export platform.",
			"\"On the lower-carbon front, we enhanced our renewable power portfolio with the announcement of the successful award to design and construct the Normandy offshore wind farm and announced a joint venture with Yara International to construct a blue ammonia project on the U.S. Gulf Coast.",
			"\"The joint venture with Yara to construct a uniquely positioned blue ammonia project demonstrates how our existing conventional asset base is leading to significant lower-carbon infrastructure opportunities. The project will be ideally situated next to our Texas Eastern pipeline system providing access to low-cost natural gas feedstock and the deep-water docks at the Enbridge Ingleside Energy Center (EIEC) which provide export access to global markets. Our joint venture with OXY to develop a nearby CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration hub will be used to sequester the project's captured CO<sub>2 </sub>and the U.S. tax incentives provided by the Inflation Reduction Act are expected to enhance project economics. This project further positions EIEC to become one of the most sustainable terminals in <span class=\"xn-location\">North America</span> producing globally competitive and decarbonized ammonia.",
			"\"Our Debt-to-EBITDA remains in the bottom half of our range at 4.6x this quarter, providing us the financial flexibility to continue adding to our organic growth backlog and to execute selective tuck-in M&amp;A. We opportunistically repurchased a small amount of shares in April demonstrating our commitment to increasing capital returns for shareholders.

			"<br/>GAAP earnings attributable to common shareholders for the first quarter of 2023 decreased by $194 million or <span class=\"xn-money\">$0.09</span> per share compared with the same period in 2022, primarily due to a realized loss of <span class=\"xn-money\">$638 million</span> (<span class=\"xn-money\">$479 million</span> after-tax) due to termination of foreign exchange hedges.

Refer to the Company's <i>Management's Discussion &amp; Analysis</i> for the first quarter of 2023 filed in conjunction with the first quarter financial statements for a detailed discussion of GAAP financial results.",
			"Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2023 increased by $321 million compared with the same period in 2022.

			"While yield is important, another factor to consider about a company's dividend is whether the current payout levels are feasible. However, Exxon Mobil's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.",
			"EPS is set to fall by 37.7% over the next 12 months. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 39%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.",
			"The company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $2.28 total annually to $3.64. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 4.8% over that duration. Slow and steady dividend growth might not sound that exciting, but dividends have been stable for ten years, which we think makes this a fairly attractive offer.",
			"The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Exxon Mobil has impressed us by growing EPS at 26% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio gives the company a lot of flexibility, and growing earnings also make it very easy for it to grow the dividend.",
			"Overall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The earnings easily cover the company's distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.",

			"Chicago, IL – May 5, 2023 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Enterprise Products Partners LP EPD, Magellan Midstream Partners LP MMP and NuStar Energy LP NS.",
			"Industry: Oil &amp; Gas - Pipeline MLP",
			"Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2089839/3-oil-gas-pipeline-stocks-to-gain-amid-industry-challenges",
			"Although the midstream energy business is less exposed to oil and gas price volatility, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Pipeline MLP industry’s outlook is still subjected to uncertainties. Due to conservative capital spending by upstream players and possibilities for soft fuel demand, production volumes could get dented, hurting demand for partnerships’ midstream assets.",
			"Despite the uncertainties, pipeline players are better off than upstream and downstream firms since the partnerships generate stable fee-based revenues from their long-term contracts with shippers. The industry frontrunners include <strong>Enterprise Products Partners LP</strong>, <strong>Magellan Midstream Partners LP</strong> and <strong>NuStar Energy LP</strong>.",
			"The Zacks Oil and Gas - Pipeline MLP industry comprises master limited partnerships (or MLPs) that are primarily engaged in transporting oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and natural gas liquids (NGL) to consumers in North America. Apart from transporting the commodities, the partnerships have huge capacities to store oil, natural gas and petrochemical products.",
			"The partnerships are thus providing midstream services to both producers and consumers of the commodities. The players generate stable fee-based revenues from all those transportation and storage assets. The services provided by the partnerships entail the gathering and processing of commodities. The integrated midstream energy players also generate cashflows from ownership interests in fractionators and condensate distillation facilities.",
			"<em><strong>Soft Pipeline Demand:</strong></em> Inflationary environment is probably spurring a slowdown in the U.S. economy, which could hurt fuel demand. The uncertainty in fuel demand is likely to affect the production of the commodity, which in turn will lower the demand for oil pipeline assets of the partnerships.",
			"<em><strong>Lower Fee-Based Revenues: </strong></em>Soft demand for midstream assets will possibly ultimately lead to lower fee-based revenues for the master limited partnerships. Also, to sail through soft demand for pipeline networks, several energy players with midstream presence will likely be left with no option but to offer discounts to shippers.",
			"<em><strong>Shift to Renewables:</strong></em> Energy majors will increasingly face challenges in providing sustainable energy to the world while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, to address the issue of climate change, there will be a gradual shift from fossil fuel to renewable energy. This will lower the demand for the partnerships’ pipeline and storage networks for oil and natural gas.",
			"<em><strong>Explorers’ Conservative Capital Spending: </strong></em>Oil and gas exploration and production companies are facing heightened pressure from investors to focus on stockholders’ returns rather than production. This is hindering the production of commodities, thereby denting pipeline and storage assets.",
			"The Zacks Oil and Gas - Pipeline MLP industry is a nine-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #190, which places it in the bottom 24% of more than 250 Zacks industries.",
			"The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bearish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.",
			"The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent stocks in aggregate. Before we present a few oil and gas pipeline MLPs that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and current valuation.",
			"The Zacks Oil and Gas - Pipeline MLP industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year. The industry has gained 1% in the past year against a decline of 6.2% of the broader sector and 1.1% of the S&amp;P 500.",
			"Since midstream-focused oil and gas partnerships use fixed-rate debt for the majority of their borrowings, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive stocks, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses.",
			"On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio, the industry is currently trading at 10.07X, lower than the S&amp;P 500’s 12.57X. It is, however, significantly above the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 2.76X.",
			"Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 15.93X and as low as 6.87X, with a median of 10.18X.",
			"<strong>Enterprise Products Partners LP:</strong>Enterprise Products is a leading North American midstream infrastructure provider, generating stable fee-based revenues from its network of NGL, crude oil, natural gas, petrochemicals and refined products pipelines, spreading across roughly 50,000 miles. Since Enterprise Products has among the highest credit ratings in the midstream space, it can lean on its strong balance sheet to survive any economic turmoils.",
			"Enterprise Products, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has witnessed upward earnings estimate revisions for 2023 in the past 30 days. Major capital growth projects worth $6.1 billion, currently under construction, have brightened its outlook.",
			"<strong>NuStar Energy LP:</strong> NuStar Energy is a well-known player in the midstream space for being the nation’s leading operator of pipeline network and liquids terminals. This depicts the stock’s stable business model for having significantly lower exposure to commodity price volatility. In the past year, the Zacks #3 Ranked stock has gained 3.9%, outpacing the industry’s 1.1% increase. You can see <strong>the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.",
			"<strong>Magellan Midstream Partners LP</strong>: Magellan Midstream has extensive petroleum midstream infrastructures that will be needed in the United States for decades to come. The business model of the company is resilient to commodity price fluctuations and derives stable fee-based revenues.",
			"The cash distribution picture looks bright, with Magellan Midstream depicting a story of 21 years of annual distribution growth. With an investment-grade credit rating, it has a strong balance sheet. The #3 Ranked stock has an excellent management team focusing consistently on creating long-term wealth for shareholders.",
			"Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of <strong>+46.4%, +49.5%</strong> and <strong>+55.2%</strong> per year. Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.",

Finally, we will make reference to some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in today's release and on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Ryan.",
			"<strong>Ryan M. Lance</strong>",
			"Thanks, Phil, and thank you to everyone for joining our first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Since we just hosted our Analyst Day and Investor Meeting in New York a few weeks ago, we are going to keep our prepared remarks fairly brief today. ConocoPhillips delivered a strong first quarter result, setting a new production record for the company as well as in the Lower 48. <br/>Underlying production growth was 4% year-on-year, including 8% year-on-year growth in the Lower 48. We are confident in our outlook for the rest of the year, and we are increasing the midpoint of our full year production guidance. We're keeping our full year capital and operating guidance unchanged. Shifting to returns on enough capital, we continue to demonstrate our returns-focused value proposition in the first quarter. <br/>Our return on capital employed once again exceeded our goal of being top quartile in the S&amp;P 500. And as we highlighted at the recent Analyst and Investor Meeting, we remain confident in our ability to achieve this objective in a mid-cycle price environment over the course of our 10-year plan. On return of capital, we are on track to deliver on our planned $11 billion for 2023, which represents greater than 50% of our projected CFO and is highly competitive with peers. <br/>And we are able to achieve all of this while investing in our attractive mid- and long-term opportunities. Our first quarter was also quite busy from a strategic perspective. At Port Arthur LNG, we acquired a 30% equity interest in the joint venture upon final investment decision on Phase 1. At Willow, we are pleased to receive a positive record of decision and began road construction. And at APLNG, we announced plans to become upstream operator following the closing of EIG's transaction with Origin and to purchase up to an additional 2.49% in the project. <br/>We also accelerated our 2030 greenhouse gas emissions intensity reduction target to 50% to 60% versus a 2016 baseline as we further advance our net 0 operational emissions ambition. I know everyone has the question on Surmont, so let me address that right now. We acknowledge that we received our right of first refusal notice, and we're certainly reviewing it carefully. <br/>Now in conclusion, as we shared at our Analyst and Investor Meeting last month, our deep, durable and diversified asset base is well positioned to generate solid returns in cash flow for decades to come. And as I said then, we challenge any other E&amp;P company to show you a plan with this kind of duration. Now let me turn the call over to Bill to cover our first quarter performance in more detail.",
			"<strong>William L. Bullock</strong>",
			"Well, thanks, Ryan. In the first quarter of 2023, we generated $2.38 per share in adjusted earnings. First quarter production was a record for the company at 1,792,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, driven by solid execution across the entire portfolio. The Eagle Ford stabilized our expansion and Qatargas 3 planned turnarounds were both successfully completed. And Lower 48 production was also a record, averaging 1,036,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, including 694,000 from the Permian; 227,000 from the Eagle Ford; 98,000 from the Bakken. <br/>And Lower 48 underlying production grew 8% year-on-year with new wells online and strong well performance relative to our expectations across our asset base. Now moving to cash flows. First quarter CFO was $5.7 billion, excluding working capital at an average WTI price of sellers per barrel. This included APLNG distributions of $764 million. Now first quarter capital expenditures were $2.9 billion, including $400 million for Port Arthur Phase 1 and $100 million in Lower 48 acquisitions. <br/>Regarding Port Arthur, as you will recall from our fourth quarter call, we said we tend to spend about $1.1 billion in 2023. So first quarter spending was very front-end loaded relative to the full year. In the first quarter, we also received $200 million in disposition proceeds. And regarding capital allocation, we returned $3.2 billion back to shareholders. And this was via $1.7 billion in share buybacks and $1.5 billion in ordinary dividends and VROC payments. <br/>Turning to guidance. We forecast second quarter production to be in a range of 1.77 million to 1.81 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. This includes 10,000 to 15,000 of planned seasonal turnarounds. We have also increased the midpoint of our full year production guidance by 10,000 barrels a day. Our new range is 1.78 million to 1.8 million barrels of oil equivalent, up from 1.7 million to 1.8 million previously. <br/>For APLNG, we expect distributions of 350 million to 400 million in the second quarter. And for the full year, we expect APLNG distributions of 1.8 billion. All other items remain unchanged. So to wrap up, we had a strong first quarter. We remain confident in our outlook, leading to our increase in full year production guidance. And we expect to return $11 billion to our shareholders this year. And we're well positioned to deliver on our commitments throughout this year. So that concludes our prepared remarks. And now I'll turn the call back over to Phil.",
			"<strong>Philip Gresh</strong>",
			"Great. Thanks, Bill. (Operator Instructions). Since we just hosted the Analyst Day a few weeks ago and is obviously quite a busy earnings day for everybody. So with that, Michelle, let's move to the Q&amp;A.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions). The first question comes from Stephen Richardson with Evercore.",
			"<strong>Stephen I. Richardson</strong>",
			"Ryan, I was wondering if you could talk, I mean, on the return of capital, obviously, outperforming 50% of cash flow from ops and setting up really strongly versus the $11 billion target. Just wondering if you could address the environment is not straightforward. There's a lot of volatility out there. And just from a shareholders' perspective, how do you think about balancing VROC buyback and just the general flexibility as people consider kind of the volatility in the commodity environment?",
			"<strong>Ryan M. Lance</strong>",
			"Yes. Thanks, Stephen. I think let me just start by recognizing the volatility that's currently in the market. But even with that, as we look at the first quarter average prices were in the mid-70s WTI quarter-to-date in the second quarter in the high 70s. So that's close enough to our planning framework that we set out early in the year that close enough to 80 and delivering the $22 billion in cash for the year. <br/>So we're not going to overreact to kind of what we're seeing in the volatility right now. So we're on track, and hopefully, you see that with the VROC that we set for the third quarter, on track to deliver the $11 billion distributions that we set out at the beginning of the year. We're comfortable with that. We have the balance sheet to support it if prices turn out a little bit lower as well. <br/>So it would take a structural change, and we certainly don't view this volatility that we're seeing right now as a structural change in the marketplace. In terms of the mix and the balance, we said we'd do about 50% shares. We leaned in a little bit in the first quarter on the shares. But through the year, we expect to be about 50-50 between our VROC and the shares to deliver the $11 billion of returns back to the shareholder. Hopefully, you see that the third quarter setting of the VROC at $0.60 a share. That should give you for -- we're on to deliver that.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.",
			"<strong>Neil Singhvi Mehta</strong>",
			"Yes. Congrats on a really good Lower 48 quarter in particular. Ryan, I think you sort of cut -- headed this question off, but I'd love you to comment to the extent you can on Surmont, recognizing it's an active situation. And as you think about that asset, first of all, it seems from the Analyst Day that it is a core position for you guys. And just any thoughts on whether it makes sense to be a bigger part of the portfolio to the extent you can comment at all?",
			"<strong>Ryan M. Lance</strong>",
			"Yes, Neil, thanks. No, I can let Andy maybe make a few comments about the assets, which would be kind of reiterating what we said at the analyst meeting. But Yes, we're in receipt of the notice on the transaction between Total and Suncor. We have a right on the Surmont asset, which we know really well because we own 50% and operate it. So we're in the process of taking a pretty serious look at that. I can maybe have Andy reiterate some of our thoughts about the asset that we described in the Analyst Meeting.",
			"<strong>Unidentified Company Representative</strong>",
			"Neil, yes, as we said in the analyst meeting, we do like Surmont as the nice sort of long life, low capital intensity asset for us. As we covered in the analyst meeting that low capital intensity is an important part of our portfolio. And just to sort of reiterate that, sort of the maintenance capital on Surmont -- I'm referring now to our 50% share of Surmont, has been in the $20 million to $30 million a year range for the last 5 years. <br/>And you'll recall, I mentioned that we're drilling our first new pad since 2016. That pad, for example, will be in the $40 million to $50 million. So it's a very low capital intensity asset for us with that sort of basically flat production profile. And as you know, sort of -- pretty much all of our other drill information we disclose in terms of our production data, our bitumen realizations, our operating costs, that's all out there. So you can form your own view on the asset, but it's an asset that is a core asset in our portfolio. I'll probably just stop there.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.",
			"<strong>Roger David Read</strong>",
			"I guess I'd like to follow up on Port Arthur LNG. Obviously, the Phase 1 was covered. There's always a possibility of greater expansion in LNG. Just what would be the things we would watch coming up in terms of the second phase?",
			"<strong>William L. Bullock</strong>",
			"Yes. Sure, Roger. This is Bill. As we talked about at the Analyst Investor Meeting, we're currently really satisfied with 30% for Phase 1 and our 5 million ton equity offtake and we're prioritizing market development over any additional offtake in equity right now. We really think we've got sufficient capital allocation to Port Arthur, and we're looking for ways to optimize our current investment. So our plate's pretty full, and we don't need -- see need to allocate significant additional capital in the near term. And so there need to be some pretty unique reasons to make it attractive.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.",
			"<strong>Kaleinoheaokealaula Scott Akamine</strong>",
			"This is actually Kalei on for Doug. My question is a follow-up on Surmont. So our understanding is that Suncor could receive certain tax benefits as part of their deal. And I'm wondering if those tax benefits would be available to you if you exercise your right of first refusal? And I'm asking the question because I think yours would look more like an asset deal, while there's is more of a corporate deal.",
			"<strong>Ryan M. Lance</strong>",
			"Well, as we said, Kalie, that we're currently reviewing the proposal that we got and the terms and the conditions. So it's a bit early to comment on tax pools.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.",
			"<strong>Sam Jeffrey Margolin</strong>",
			"The capital efficiency looks like it's going in the right direction with the production guidance and the capital plan in line. At the Analyst Day, you made some comments where you thought it was at least possible that you could start to see inflation ease if not reverse. And the question is just as you think about this production results, is that an outcome of maybe an opportunity to press activity a little bit as costs are easing? Or is this -- is it more of a well results-driven outcome?",
			"<strong>Dominic E. Macklon</strong>",
			"It's Dominic here. Just to talk to inflation a little bit first. I think overall, our capital inflation for the company, we still expect to be in the mid-single digits year-over-year. So we certainly see that all leveling off. As you mentioned before, we've probably seen deflationary trends in steel tubulars, oil price-related commodities such as fuel and chemicals, beyond that on the rig and other services. They've certainly leveled off. <br/>We may be trending towards some reductions. We have seen rig counts peak and begin to decline. That's led by the gas basins. So our teams are very focused on costs, and they're working with our many service providers on that, but we still expect around the mid-single digits at this stage on inflation. Having said that, we certainly see capital efficiency coming through. <br/>I think that's really on an execution front. So we've had a strong start, particularly in the Lower 48. Our full year production guidance, as we've said, is up at the midpoint. We do expect low to mid-single digits growth for the year, and that's pretty consistent with the long-term 4% to 5% CAGR we presented at our investor meeting. We're holding our capital range the same with $11 billion at the midpoint. So we're definitely seeing some execution efficiency. We're pleased about that. Nick, you may want to talk a little bit more about the Lower 48 on that.",
			"<strong>Nicholas G. Olds</strong>",
			"All right. Thanks, Dom. Yes, Sam, just to take you back to the analyst call when we talked about drilling and completions efficiency. If you recall, we had from 2019 to 2022, we had a 50% improvement in drilling, 60% improvement in completion at stages per day. We continue to see that in Q1, very promising results, and that's the use of technology like semi frac, e-frac. <br/>We're testing out some remote frac as well where we keep a frac spread on pad 1 and then we frac pad 2, pad 3, pad 4. So very promising results there. as well on the drilling front, we continue to use data analytics and rig automation, but all that's coming together, so really promising. That did lead to some accelerated places on production of wells in Q1 driving some of the overperformance.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from John Royall with JPMorgan.",
			"<strong>John Macalister Royall</strong>",
			"So my question is just on Willow. Are there any updates there to how the lawsuits are progressing? And are you any closer to a resolution there and getting to FID then when we last saw you a few weeks ago with the AIM?",
			"<strong>Unidentified Company Representative</strong>",
			"John, this is Andy. Yes, there's really not too much new to comment on over the last few weeks. So the only incremental news we've had has all been positive. The 9 Circle Court of Appeals denied motions attempting to stop our construction work. So we've been progressing with the winter season, and we've had gravel extraction and road construction underway. It's pretty much going as we expected it would in the last 2, 3 weeks, not much more to add than we talked about at the analyst Investor Day.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.",
			"<strong>Ryan M. Todd</strong>",
			"Ryan, and -- maybe one for you, following up on the Analyst Day. But what impact, if any, does -- you increased your view of the mid-cycle oil price from 50% to 60%. What impact, if any, does that have on the way in which you think about the business. I mean you're still focused on low cost of supply assets well below this price. Does the view that oil prices would be structural to have over time have any impact on the way you think about managing the business over the long term, your balance sheet, allocation of capital or anything else?",
			"<strong>Ryan M. Lance</strong>",
			"No. Thanks, Ryan. In terms of how we're running the company day to day and the allocation of capital that we're put in each year, it really doesn't. We're only investing in things that have a cost of supply less than $40 WTI in the portfolio. So what a mid-cycle price change, our Chief Economist office, our commercial team, we go through a process every year where we take a current view of the macro and have a long-range view of what we think is happening. <br/>And as we've gone through a lot of turmoil in the business, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, just the lack of investment going into the business these days. we stepped back and did our own bottoms up, which we do every year, but important this year, we did our own bottoms-up work to try to understand where we think the mid-cycle price is moving to. And what it was at -- staying at kind of that $50 level. <br/>Our assessment of the price required to generate that incremental barrel to meet that incremental demand, our assessment put it at around $60 today. And so that -- so the implications of that are really just how much cash flow we think we're going to be generating as we interrogate the portfolio, as we invest in the growth and development of the company, and we put capital into the company the way it manifests itself is just how much floor we can deliver at that kind of mid-cycle price, which is obviously a little bit more than what we would deliver at the lower price. <br/>So it goes to sort of how we think about cash in the balance sheet, how we think about the debt that we're carrying, how we think about distributions and how much capacity there is to distribute a bunch of our cash, which our commitment is about 30%. And when we get above mid-cycle price in our cycle like we are today, obviously, we're generating a lot more cash, and we're returning a lot more cash to the shareholder, now something in excess of 50% today. But that's driven by the reinvestment rate that we have in the company our commitment to only invest in the lowest cost supply things we have in the portfolio.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.",
			"<strong>Devin J. McDermott</strong>",
			"So I wanted to go back to the Lower 48. It was helpful detail before on some of the efficiencies that you're seeing there. I think one of the other drivers of the strength in production that you called out in the prepared remarks was well performance beating your expectations. Can you talk a little bit more explicitly about what you're seeing there and if there's any development changes that you've made driving that uplift?",
			"<strong>Nicholas G. Olds</strong>",
			"Yes. Devin, this is Nick. You're right. Strong well performance was definitely a contributing factor for Q1. If I take you back to the Q4 call, I had mentioned that our well performance was meeting or exceeding-type curve expectations, and we continue to see that trend in Q1. So that's very encouraging. No overall development changes. We're just seeing very promising results across all assets. It is just not the Permian as well. <br/>And as I mentioned earlier, the completion and drilling efficiency has allowed us to accelerate some wells earlier into Q1, and so we're seeing that production come into play. And then on the Eagle Ford stabilization plant that we've updated, the team just did a remarkable job in sheltering the amount of downtime in Q1. So we had less DT, but overall, a very strong quarter.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Josh Silverstein with UBS.",
			"<strong>Joshua Ian Silverstein</strong>",
			"Just some questions around potential LNG opportunities in the future. You mentioned at the Analyst Day that you have options around Port Arthur Phase 2, 3 and 4 and even at (inaudible) as well. Can you just give us some more details around the options? Does it need to be at the 30% like you did in Phase I for Port Arthur? Or could it be 10% or some other agreement there? Could it be before or after FID as well? And then just along the same lines because there will already be some infrastructure in the ground for Phase 1, will the capital outlay for Phase 2 or 3 be less because of that?",
			"<strong>William L. Bullock</strong>",
			"Yes. So I think we laid this out pretty well at our analyst meeting. So for Port Arthur, we've got options on both equity and offtake for future phases. Those can be executed either for equity offtake or both as they present themselves through time. We also have some options on the West Coast of Mexico at Energy coastal Azul on Phase 2. And so those are long-dated options that we continue to look at. <br/>I talked a bit about Phase 2 earlier in the call. And so there need to be some pretty unique opportunities on that as we think about that right now. Now as we think about future phases we have structured our investment in Phase 1, such that we benefit from the economies of scale for future phases on our Phase 1 investment. So future phases actually benefit Phase 1.",

			"The next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.",
			"<strong>Paul Cheng</strong>",
			"Maybe this is for, Nick. Nick in the investor day, (inaudible) you are talking about 2023, the shale oil production of 1 million barrels per day. And in the first quarter, you're already there. Does that means that for the rest of the year that the Lower 48 shale oil and 1 million together will be pretty stretched? Or that, that number is somewhat conservative now?",
			"<strong>Nicholas G. Olds</strong>",
			"Yes, Paul, this is Nick. You're right. I mean, we had a very strong performance in Q1, as we just described. As you look at the future quarters of this year, we've got some larger pad projects, longer horizontal wells. And kind of put that in context, we've got 80% of our 2023 Permian wells are 2 miles or greater as we've got a fairly large portion that are of the 3 miles. But you're going to see kind of small variations. But overall, that's going to be relatively flat. But I'll leave you with this pause. Our plan will deliver at least mid-single digits for Lower 48.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.",
			"<strong>Scott Michael Hanold</strong>",
			"I just wonder if you could provide some updated commentary if you have any on Venezuela. About a month ago, there was some talks about kind of easing oil sanctions there. And you all have a potential big asset or at least valued that at one point in time, were looking to extract. Is there any update on that? Or is there any kind of color you can talk about like the progress and remind us of the value there?",
			"<strong>Ryan M. Lance</strong>",
			"Yes, Scott, yes, we're right in the middle of all those conversations, as you might imagine, including the most recent conversations around the (inaudible) refining assets. We're in the queue, we're in the -- right in the middle of anything that would happen there. We have -- as a reminder, an ICC judgment of $2 billion. We've collected about $700 million on that judgment to date. So we have an outstanding -- what they owe us on that particular judgment. <br/>We're in an appeal process with (inaudible) which is the other tribunal, and that's an $8 billion potential award coming. Now there's some overlap between the two, so you can't necessarily add the two together. But I guess the point is there was a lot of money. And we're hard at trying to get some resolution of that. <br/>And the recent news out of the judge and the U.S. government around CITCO is certainly helpful in that regard. It looks like despite the sanctions that are on the Venezuelans and on U.S. companies for doing work in Venezuela, there's a little bit of -- some light developing at the end of that tunnel, and we're right in the middle of it all.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Alastair Syme with Citi.",
			"<strong>Alastair Roderick Syme</strong>",
			"In your remarks, beginning on the Lower 48, you mentioned about infrastructure build. And I was really just interested to try and understand across the Lower 48, but I guess, especially in the Permian, what's the sort of ratio of capital that's going into infrastructure versus drilling? I guess, it changes over the life of the assets. So I'm just kind of intrigued what's the point of asset like are we in terms of that ratio?",
			"<strong>Ryan M. Lance</strong>",
			"Yes. I'm not sure the exact ratio. Maybe Nick might have some numbers, but I think most of what we're doing is large pad development with not single well facilities, but central facilities supporting those large pads. I don't know what the split between drilling and infrastructure spend is. I can let Nick have a comment, but I don't think it's much different than what we've been doing for the past few years.",
			"<strong>Nicholas G. Olds</strong>",
			"Yes, Alastair, it's very limited as far as on the infrastructure spend, most of your expenditures on drilling and completions in the Permian as an example.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Raphael DuBois with Societe Generale.",
			"<strong>Raphaël DuBois</strong>",
			"I just have one question about the working capital deterioration in 1Q. I was wondering if you could tell us how much of it is due to some Norwegian cash tax catch-up? And what is it to expect for the rest of the year?",
			"<strong>William L. Bullock</strong>",
			"Yes, sure. Happy to talk about working capital. So if you look at working capital for Q1, you can see that in the supplementary documents we put out on our website, Q1 was about a $100 million use of working capital. For Q2, we'd expect that to be just over $1 billion. And as you rightly noted, that's associated with Norwegian tax payments, which is normal for operators in Norway. <br/>We accrued those in 2022. They're payable in the second quarter of 2023. And then looking for the rest of the year, assuming we don't see FX rates move materially for the remainder of the year, we'd expect -- we wouldn't really expect any material working capital movements across Q3 or Q4. So I hope that helps for kind of full year view.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.",
			"<strong>Neal David Dingmann</strong>",
			"My question is on shareholder return plan. Specifically, what do you all view sort of in broad terms as an optimal quarterly payout given, I guess, now how even more volatile the commodity market continues to be and looking at your most recent, I guess, the payout was a bit over 100%?",
			"<strong>Ryan M. Lance</strong>",
			"Yes. Well, I think, Neil, you have to kind of go back to how we set the VROC in the first quarter. That was actually set in the third quarter of last year at a $100 price environment. So we probably had -- on the rate of all -- a little bit higher distribution in this quarter and then it gets more ratable as we go through second, third and fourth quarter as we deliver the $11 billion that we've targeted for this year. And that's evidenced by how we set the VROC for the third quarter at $0.60 a share.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our last question comes from Leo Mariani with ROTH MKM.",
			"<strong>Leo Paul Mariani</strong>",
			"Obviously, strong results out of COP today, you enumerated a couple of reasons. The first quarter production beat. It sounds like some wells came on early, and well results continue to be very strong. But just wanted to dive in a little bit on the maintenance side. I know you guys kind of talked about 35,000 BOE per day of maintenance in the quarter that actually come to fruition. Maybe that number was a bit different. And then can you talk about maintenance rest of the year you had 10,000 to 15,000 expected in 2Q, but any expectations for 3Q or 4Q?",
			"<strong>Dominic E. Macklon</strong>",
			"Yes. Thanks. It's Dominic here. So you're right. We did anticipate about 35,000 barrels a day of turnaround and maintenance impact in the first quarter. That actually came in at 25,000, so 10,000 lower. That was partly because of the efficiency that Nick talked about at the Lower 48. The Eagle Ford sugar log stabilized expansion went really well, and the team did a great job sheltering some of that. <br/>Then there was a little bit of timing there around Qatar turnarounds as well. So we had 25,000 barrels a day impact in the first quarter. We still expect a full year average impact from our turnarounds of about 15,000 barrels a day equivalent. Bill said, second quarter, I think, as he mentioned, we expect to be 10,000 to 15,000. And there will also be some standard sort of seasonal downtime in the second and third quarter we typically see in Norway and Alaska and APLNG. But all of that's reflected in our new guidance, 1.78 million to 1.8 million barrels a day. for the full year.",

			"<strong>Shawn Amini</strong>",
			"Thank you for joining us today for Texas Pacific Land Corporation's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Yesterday afternoon, the company released its financial results and filed its Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is available on the Investors section of the company's website at www.texaspacific.com. As a reminder, remarks made on today's conference call may include forward-looking statements.

Please also note, we may, at times, refer to our company by its stock ticker, TPL. <br/>This morning's conference call is hosted by TPL's Chief Executive Officer, Ty Glover; and Chief Financial Officer, Chris Steddum. Management will make some prepared comments, after which we will open the call for questions. <br/>Now I will turn the call over to Ty.",
			"<strong>Tyler Glover</strong>",
			"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. TPL delivered another strong quarter as our non-oil and gas royalty businesses helped to mitigate the impact of lower oil and gas prices. During first quarter 2023 WTI Cushing Oil and Henry Hub natural gas prices were down 19% and 43%, respectively, compared to the same time period last year, and as a result of that direct exposure to prices, our oil and gas royalty revenues were down 14%. <br/>However, on a year-over-year basis, for first quarter 2023, our sourced water sales were up 15%. Produced water royalties were up 35%, and our easement and other surface-related income was up 63%. When commodity prices come under pressure, these non-oil and gas royalty revenue streams are especially valuable as they provide the company built-in hedges and countercyclical revenues. This quarter, nearly 40% of our revenues were outside of oil and gas royalties. As many of you know, TPL has not historically hedged our commodity price exposure related to royalties. <br/>For us, the non-oil and gas royalty cash flow streams and our debt-free balance sheet are the hedge. Even during a long period of severely depressed prices, TPL has shown it can generate substantial positive free cash flow. 2020 was a great example of that. And when the cycle inevitably turns, as it did last year, our hedge-free position ensures that we capture maximum upside. <br/>Despite some recent turbulence with oil and gas prices, the long-term outlook for TPL remains strong, underpinned by the Permian is arguably the best resource play in North America. We remain optimistic based on our conversations with our customers across surface and water. From our internal data, leading indicators, such as new permitting and drilling activity remain at historically strong levels.<br/>As we've said in the past, quarter-to-quarter performance may fluctuate, but we continue to expect royalty production and overall activity to trend upwards over the long term. As previously disclosed on November 22, 2022, the company filed a complaint and Delaware Chancery Court to resolve a disagreement with Horizon Kinetics LLC, Horizon Kinetics Asset Management LLC, SoftVest Advisors LLC and SoftVest, L.P. over their voting commitments pursuant to a stockholders' agreement with the company. The Delaware Court of Chancery held a 1-day trial on April 17, 2023. Following post-trial briefing, the company anticipates the court to issue a decision. <br/>With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.",
			"<strong>Chris Steddum</strong>",
			"Thanks, Ty. Total revenues for the quarter of 2023 were $146 million, representing a 4% decline sequentially from fourth quarter 2022 revenues. Revenues were impacted by lower oil and gas prices and royalty production, though offset by higher sourced water sales, produced water volumes and easements and other surface-related income. <br/>Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow for the quarter were $116 million and $88 million, respectively. We ended the quarter with $591 million of cash on the balance sheet. TPL's near-term inventory outlook remains strong with approximately 5 net permits, 7.8 net DUCs and 3.3 net completed wells at the end of the quarter. <br/>As Ty referenced earlier, our preliminary data shows first quarter 2023 as the second best quarter ever for new permits on a net lateral feet basis. For new spuds, first quarter 2023 would be a record on a net lateral feet drilled basis, which is driven by both higher gross new spuds and also longer lateral lengths now approaching nearly 11,000 feet on average. <br/>We continue to evaluate our capital allocation priorities as company and industry fundamentals evolve. For this quarter, we have maintained our $3.25 per share dividend. Our previously announced $250 million buyback authorization began on January 1 of this year, and as we move out of a blackout period, we have room to lean more heavily on that program with a large cash balance, 0 debt and a business that continues to generate ample free cash flow, we retain tremendous amount of flexibility to be opportunistic as we look to maximize shareholder value. <br/>And with that, operator, we will now take questions.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) <br/>The first question comes from Derrick Whitfield from Stifel.",
			"<strong>Derrick Lee Whitfield</strong>",
			"My first question, I wanted to focus on the growth outlook of your oil and gas royalty segment. With the understanding that you don't provide quarterly guidance in Q1 was negatively impacted by less spills. How should we think about the near-term production trajectory in light of your line of sight activity, which increased sequentially? <br/>And separately, could you comment on the degree you guys were impacted by the issues Chevron experienced during Q4 earnings and outlined further at its Analyst Day. It does appear there was a higher-than-expected depletion effects after long-sitting DUCs, but that appears to be onetime in nature. But again, any color you could offer would be greatly appreciated.",
			"<strong>Chris Steddum</strong>",
			"I might tackle the first part of the question. So when we think about our production outlook, I think what we've said in the past is that we still expect TPL to outperform the basin over kind of the near and medium term. And so I think we still feel that, that will be the case. And to your point, when we look at kind of the net normalized DUCs permits, all of those numbers are effectively at all-time highs right now. <br/>And so certainly, from a near-term inventory perspective, we feel like TPL is in a great spot right now. And so there's certainly plenty of near-term inventory to give a positive production outlook for the rest of the year. Now look, the pace at which the operators are going to take down that inventory, that's always the difficult part to predict. But as far as what we've got out there, it looks great. It looks strong. DUCs look great. <br/>And I think at the end of the day, what we kind of have seen as we've gotten the data in as the fourth quarter, right, the amount of wells turned in line was just a little bit lower. And that happens quarter-to-quarter like we say, it is going to be somewhat volatile in the short term. But in the long term, I think our outlook still remains strong, and we think we'll continue to outpace the basin. And I don't know, Ty, if you wanted to talk any about some of the operator?",
			"<strong>Tyler Glover</strong>",
			"Yes. I'll take a stab at the second part of your question there. I think what you're referring to is some of the well results that Chevron had I would say that while Chevron owns the minerals under a large portion of our position, most of that has been leased out or farmed out. And so we actually have a fairly small exposure to Chevron operations overall, if you look at what they operate as a percentage of our entire position. So I'm not sure if that's helpful.",
			"<strong>Derrick Lee Whitfield</strong>",
			"It is. And then maybe shifting over to the SLEM business, you guys experienced one of the strongest quarters since 2019. In addition to record activity, are there other noticeable drivers that we should be thinking about?",
			"<strong>Tyler Glover</strong>",
			"Yes. I would say the main drivers on the ramp in SLEM has been an increase in pipeline easements. As we've seen gas take away tighten, we're starting to see more requests for gathering infrastructure. Our team has done a really good job in the field with rock sales. So we've opened up some new caliche pits. We're crushing rock now. We've expanded sales into New Mexico. And so we've seen a nice ramp in rock sales as well. We had a little bit of sand royalty towards the end of the quarter. So expect that to ramp up as well here in the near future.",
			"<strong>Derrick Lee Whitfield</strong>",
			"And perhaps one last if I could. Just with respect to your trial versus Horizon Kinetics, what should we expect from the post-trial briefing schedule, meaning I'm not asking you to project an outcome, but does a favorable outcome allow you to advance Proposal 4, assuming you have a shareholder approval.",
			"<strong>Tyler Glover</strong>",
			"Say the last part of that question one more time, Derrick, sorry.",
			"<strong>Derrick Lee Whitfield</strong>",
			"Sure. So with respect to the decision that comes out of the post-trial briefing schedule with Horizon Kinetics, what should we expect from that? And by that, I mean, I'm not asking you to project an outcome of the trial, but does a favorable outcome allow you to advance Proposal 4, assuming you have shareholder approval?",
			"<strong>Tyler Glover</strong>",
			"Yes, that's correct.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Hamed Khorsand from BWS Financial.",
			"<strong>Hamed Khorsand</strong>",
			"The first question I had was on just the legal expense line. Is that an accrued expense. What should we expect in Q2? And is that a normal number? I mean it seems quite excessive.",
			"<strong>Chris Steddum</strong>",
			"Hamed, that is an accrued expense. And look, we really can't comment on expectations of what the spend may be in the future. And so that's kind of where it's at right now.",
			"<strong>Hamed Khorsand</strong>",
			"Okay. And then on the revenue side, could you just talk about this onetime revenue that was disclosed in the Q, what sparked it and what your future revenue would be if there is any from this arbitration?",
			"<strong>Chris Steddum</strong>",
			"Yes. The -- effectively, it was a stipulation that -- based on what we felt that Chevron was, I guess, over deducting some expenses in the past. So all of that revenue is associated with past period where they had probably overcharged on some of the expenses on the gas and NGL side. And so I think the right way to think about it is, it's effectively a kind of a onetime payment to rectify that.",
			"<strong>Hamed Khorsand</strong>",
			"Okay. So I assume that the oil revenue would have been down another $8 million on a normalized basis then.",
			"<strong>Chris Steddum</strong>",
			"Yes. That's the right way to think about it. And again, it's just -- I guess, as we said in some of our prepared remarks compared to last year and even last quarter, across the board, we've seen quite a bit of commodity price weakness.",
			"<strong>Hamed Khorsand</strong>",
			"Okay. And then my last question was that also in the Q, you disclosed that there was a $3.6 million put into the Water Resource business. What was that for? And is the business itself generating positive free cash flow?",
			"<strong>Chris Steddum</strong>",
			"Yes. So the capital is basically in line with the capital we probably spend each quarter. Usually, it's been about a $12 million capital spend for most years. The right way to think about that is some of it is the continued electrification of our operations. So we are approaching the end of that electrification process. Some of that is purchasing different like lay-flat hoses and operating equipment that we need day-to-day. And you could think of that type of stuff is more like a maintenance capital, right? <br/>So those would be dollars that we would probably continue to spend in the future to maintain the business and our equipment. And then some of it is, I think we've probably said in the past, the supply chains have slowed down for some of the key items that you need to operate. And so we have also gone out and probably purchased in advance or at least further in advance than we normally would some of the key infrastructure items, tanks and hoses that we know we're going to need in the future to fulfill customer orders. <br/>And so that's kind of what that number is and the right way to think about it. And if you look at the financials, that business had $20 million of positive net income this quarter. And also free cash flow -- positive free cash flow.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Thank you very much. That was our final question, and that concludes the Q&amp;A session as well as the teleconference for today. <br/>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your participation, and you may now disconnect your lines."

			"Speaking as the FTSE 100 giant posted record quarterly profits of nearly $10bn (£8bn) from $9.1bn a year earlier, chief executive Wael Sawan said the company wants to be a major investor in renewable power but needed “the right ecosystem to be able to do that”.",
			"Mr Sawan said: “I would hope any government coming in would see that and support that.”",
			"He was responding to comments by Labour’s shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and shadow energy secretary Ed Miliband, who both called for higher windfall taxes on energy companies on Thursday.",
			"Pointing to Shell’s first quarter profit of $9.6bn, Labour’s Ms Reeves accused the Conservatives of refusing to “bring in a proper windfall tax on oil and gas giants”.",
			"Mr Miliband, meanwhile, tweeted: “It is staggering that Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives refuse to implement a proper windfall tax to make the energy companies pay their fair share.",
			"“Labour would bring in a proper windfall tax on oil and gas giants to freeze council tax this year.”",
			"The Government has already imposed a so-called <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:energy profits levy;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/05/29/windfall-tax-meaning-uk-energy-companies-what-how-work/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">energy profits levy</a> after the Ukraine war sent oil and gas prices soaring, raising the effective tax rate on North Sea producers from 40pc to 65pc.",
			"It is expected to bring in about £5bn annually in its first three years, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility, with Shell predicting it will pay around £1bn over the levy’s lifetime.",
			"However, critics say the tax does not go far enough, after the world’s five largest oil and gas companies – Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and TotalEnergies – posted combined profits of nearly $200bn in 2022.",
			"And Shell’s announcement that it would hand $12bn back to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks in the first half of 2023 stoked further calls for a bigger tax raid.",

			"He said it was “important to recognise” that investments being made by the company today would often not provide returns until a decade later.",

Because of their massive footprint, these high-profile companies feature transparent, predictable businesses. However, the other side of this relationship centers on a decided lack of upside potential.",

Or if they do, those headlines might not be the most encouraging for prospective investors. Still, underneath the hood lie compelling operations that may yield significant rewards. In other words, you can have your cake and eat it too.

			"An American supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and related services to the semiconductor industry, <strong>Lam Research</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:LRCX;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/lrcx-stock-quote/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>LRCX</strong></a>) easily ranks among the hidden-gem blue-chip stocks to buy now; that is, of course, you’re one of those experts on wafer fabrication equipment. Lam’s quiet, everyday relevance for critical semiconductor industries launched LRCX to a nearly 21% return so far this year. In the past 365 days, it’s up over 9%.",
			"Financially, what makes Lam an all-around strong candidate for best blue-chip stocks for 2023 is consistency. As data from Gurufocus.com demonstrates, Lam is consistently profitable. As well, it features a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:three-year revenue growth rate;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/LRCX/summary?search=lrcx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">three-year revenue growth rate</a> of 26.6%, above 81.77% of sector players.",
			"Enticingly, LRCX also ranks among the blue-chip stocks with low risk and high reward. At present, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 17.61. As a discount to projected earnings, Lam ranks better than 61.19% of the competition. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg LRCX as a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:consensus moderate buy;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lrcx/forecast\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">consensus moderate buy</a>. On average, the price target is $545.06, implying 9% upside potential. However, the most optimistic target calls for $600 or up 20%.",
			"Source: Shutterstock",
			"A relatively easy case for blue-chip stocks to buy now, <strong>Marathon Petroleum</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:MPC;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/mpc-stock-quote/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>MPC</strong></a>) specializes in petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation. The former two components represent the downstream segment of the hydrocarbon energy value chain whereas the latter aligns with the midstream segment. Fundamentally, the possible rise in energy prices due to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:broader oil production cuts;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/2023/04/why-are-stocks-down-today-29/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">broader oil production cuts</a> cynically augurs well for MPC.",
			"Another attractive feature for MPC is that it also ranks among the blue-chip stocks with strong fundamentals. Operationally, Marathon’s <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:three-year revenue growth rate;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/MPC/summary?search=mpc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">three-year revenue growth rate</a> pings at 27.1%, outpacing 81.45% of sector rivals. Also, its free cash flow growth rate during the same period is 57.1%, above 85.28% of competitors.",
			"Notably, investors can also consider MPC as one of the blue-chip stocks with low risk and high reward. Currently, the market prices MPC at a trailing multiple of 4.31. As a discount to earnings, Marathon ranks better than 71.79% of the competition. Lastly, analysts peg MPC as a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:consensus strong buy;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/mpc/forecast\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">consensus strong buy</a>.

Thanks to its powerful relevancies, AMAT deserves consideration as one of the blue-chip stocks to buy now. Since the Jan. opener, shares popped up over 14%.",
			"Overall, AMAT also legitimately deserves the label of blue-chip stock with strong fundamentals. Anchored by a solid balance sheet, investors may focus on the company’s three-year revenue growth rate of 23.9%, which beats out 77.7% of other semiconductor firms. Also, its FCF growth rate pings at an impressive 21% during the aforementioned period.",
			"Enticingly, the market prices AMAT at a forward multiple of 14.98. As a discount to projected earnings, Applied Materials ranks better than 66.42% of sector players. Also, it features a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:dividend yield;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amat/dividends\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dividend yield</a> of 0.92% and a low payout ratio of 13.2%, perhaps making it one of the blue-chip stocks with dividend growth. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg AMAT as a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:consensus moderate buy;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amat/forecast\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">consensus moderate buy</a>.

Throughout its history, Equinor converted natural resources into energy. Now, it’s embarking on a broader transition to support clean and renewable initiatives. Over the intermediate term, the bullish dynamics of the hydrocarbon market may lift EQNR. So far, though, EQNR gave up 13% of its equity value since the Jan. opener.",
			"Despite the turbulence, EQNR deserves consideration as one of the blue-chip stocks to buy now. Financially, the company benefits from robust stats. For instance, Equinor commands a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:cash-to-debt ratio;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/EQNR/summary?search=eqnr\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cash-to-debt ratio</a> of 1.22, above nearly 61% of sector peers. Operationally, it enjoys an impressive three-year revenue growth rate of 39.5%.",
			"Also, what makes EQNR a candidate for the best blue-chip stocks for 2023 is the value proposition. Currently, shares run a price-earnings-growth ratio of only 0.11 times. In contrast, the sector median stands at 0.76 times. To close out, analysts peg EQNR as a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:consensus moderate buy;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/eqnr/forecast\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">consensus moderate buy</a>. Their average price target lands at $37.05, implying 31% upside potential.",

			"Although it’s difficult to call <strong>Taiwan Semiconductor</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:TSM;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/tsm-stock-quote/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>TSM</strong></a>) a candidate for hidden gem blue-chip stocks to buy now, it does make an intriguingly bullish case. First, let’s get address the giant pink elephant in the room. Due to worsening tensions between the U.S. and China, Taiwan Semiconductor operates in a geopolitical hotspot. Still, unless the Chinese government seeks to destroy its economy, it may play it cool regarding the breakaway island.",
			"Financially, the company surprisingly delivers the goods because of its massive importance to the global semiconductor supply chain. Notably, TSM’s three-year revenue growth rate comes out to 28.4%, ranked better than 83.28% of its peers. Also, its FCF growth rate during the same period lands at an impressive 53%.",
			"For all the heat, TSM is undervalued, making it one of the best blue-chip stocks for 2023. Presently, the market prices TSM at a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:forward multiple of 15.64;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/TSM/summary?search=tsm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">forward multiple of 15.64</a>, favorably below 64.18% of the industry. Looking to the Street, analysts peg TSM as a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:unanimous strong buy;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsm/forecast\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">unanimous strong buy</a>. Their average price target stands at $118.67, implying over 44% upside potential.",

			"A mining and exploration company, <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:RIO;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/rio-stock-quote/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>RIO</strong></a>) deserves the label of hidden gem blue-chip stocks to buy now. Primarily, the company’s headquarters are located in the U.K., making it less likely to be known by the average American. Also, Rio’s core industry – metals mining and extracting – isn’t the sexiest in the world now dominated by memes. Plus, since the Jan. opener, RIO slipped almost 13%.",
			"Taking the negativity aside, RIO makes for one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy for 2023 because of its core financials. Operationally, the company features a three-year revenue growth rate of 11.7%, outpacing 61.5% of its peers. On the bottom line, its trailing-year net margin stands at 22.31%, above 86.52%.",
			"As a bonus, Rio Tinto is <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:undervalued;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/RIO/summary?search=rio\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">undervalued</a>. The market prices RIO at a forward multiple of 8.48. As a discount to projected earnings, the mining specialist ranks better than 68.78% of the competition. Lastly, analysts peg RIO as a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:unanimous strong buy;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/rio/forecast\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">unanimous strong buy</a>.

			"While it’s not quite a hidden gem, biopharmaceutical firm <strong>Moderna</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:MRNA;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/mrna-stock-quote/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>MRNA</strong></a>) could be a hidden gem right now. With fears of the SARS-CoV-2 virus all but shriveled in the rearview mirror, nobody cares about the vaccine race. Well, I shouldn’t say nobody cares but the furor certainly subsided. Nevertheless, Moderna can leverage its acumen to develop more relevant solutions, making it a worthwhile idea.",
			"For its long-term potential, MRNA should rank among the blue-chip stocks to buy now. As well, the finances bolster confidence in the bullish view. Currently, Moderna features an Altman Z-Score of 8.09, indicating high fiscal stability and a low risk of bankruptcy. Operationally, its three-year revenue growth rate shot up into the stratosphere.",
			"Further, on the bottom line, the company prints a net margin of 44.3%, above nearly 96% of the competition. And it’s also technically undervalued, priced at only 6.76 times trailing earnings. On a final note, analysts peg MRNA as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $221.92, implying almost 65% upside potential.",

Unlike regional banks facing questions about funding costs, the bank is in pristine shape. It is the fourth-largest bank in the U.S., with a nationwide branch presence. This strong retail franchise enables it to have one of the lowest deposit costs in the industry.",

For instance, in December 2022, it settled with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for $3.7 billion.",
			"Since the asset cap restriction, Wells Fargo has focused on improving its efficiency and streamlining its operations. These initiatives have led to an improved operating ratio. Analysts hope the Fed will eventually lift its asset cap as Wells Fargo works through the remaining consent orders. A quick look at analyst research on the stock reflects this.

			"And the bullish analyst view is also backed by a cheap valuation. Wells Fargo is trading at a relatively low price-to-book (P/B). At the end of 1Q 2023, the book and tangible book value per share were $43.02 and $35.87, respectively. Finally, besides the low P/B, the bank has an attractive 3% yield.",

			"The projected multi-billion-dollar Greater Sunrise development on the maritime boundary between East Timor and Australia has been stalled for decades amid disputes over where the gas should be processed into liquefied natural gas (LNG).",
			"In February, however, partners in the Sunrise Joint Venture, which includes majority owner Timor Gap, operator Woodside and the Australian arm of Osaka Gas, formally committed to working rapidly to pick the best option for developing the field, factoring in for the first time the potential benefits for East Timor.",
			"A study to evaluate processing and selling the gas in East Timor, called Timor-Leste, versus Australia and the costs of each location requires the approval of a designated authority representing the interests of both countries.",
			"\"Once the authorities approve, we can do the study, which will maybe take between three to six months to finalize,\" De Sousa said.",
			"The development of the Greater Sunrise field is critical to the Southeast Asia island nation's economy as its main source of revenue - the Bayu Undan oil and gas field - stopped producing gas earlier this year.",
			"Central to East Timor's hopes of cinching the project is the availability of using newer, modular LNG processing units, as well as operating costs that are expected to be lower than in Australia.",
			"Costs of building an LNG plant in Timor Leste could be lower than previously estimated due to newer processing technology, De Sousa said.",
			"The Australian Financial Review last year reported that the independent study showed total capital cost for the LNG project would be $11.8 billion in Darwin, Australia, and $14.1 billion in Timor-Leste.",
			"The Sunrise Joint Venture is aiming to complete the study \"expeditiously\" and Woodside recognizes the importance of promoting Timor-Leste's economic development, Australia-based Woodside's spokesperson said. (Reporting by Arathy Somasekhar in Houston Editing by Marguerita Choy)"

Chevron’s upstream operations involve the exploration, production, and transportation of crude oil and natural gas, while its downstream operations involve the refining, marketing, and distribution of petroleum products. Boosting its core oil and gas operations, Chevron also has investments in alternative energy sources such as geothermal and solar.",
			"Despite weak production and lower oil and gas prices in Q1, Chevron was able to bolster its earnings through successful refining operations, resulting in a strong quarter overall. Revenue fell by 6.6% year-over-year to $50.79 billion, but came in $1.3 billion above expectations. Chevron dialed in adjusted earnings of $6.7 billion, up from $6.5 billion in the same period a year ago, which resulted in adj. EPS of $3.55, bettering the $3.41 expected by the analysts.",
			"Chevron is also a member of the exclusive Dividend Aristocrat club – a group of firms with over 25 years of repeated dividend raises. The current payout stands at $1.51 and yields 3.6%.",
			"Druckenmiller obviously has big faith in Chevron’s ongoing success. CVX is the third largest holding in his portfolio (8.73%), and currently worth $155 million.",
			"The company also has a fan in Raymond James’ Justin Jenkins. Looking ahead, the 5-star analyst thinks investor worries about production are set to subside from here on in.",
			"“With a strong financial base, high relative shareholder payout, and an attractive relative asset portfolio, we think Chevron still offers the most straightforwardly positive risk/reward in a market that’s become tougher to differentiate among the oil &amp; gas majors,” Jenkins explained. “1Q earnings were solid in CVX’s Upstream portfolio while downstream results added to upside. As execution continues to a 2H23+ weighted production profile in the Permian, we think investor concerns will ease.”",
			"These comments form the basis for Jenkins’ Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating, while his $208 price target suggests the shares will post growth of 32% over the coming year. (To watch Jenkins’ track record, <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:click here;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/justin-jenkins\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>)",
			"Overall, 16 analysts have chimed in with CVX reviews over the past 3 months and these breakdown into 6 Buys and 10 Holds, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average target stands at $190.25, implying shares will gain ~21% in the months ahead. (See <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:CVX stock forecast;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/cvx/forecast\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>CVX stock forecast</strong></a>)",
			"<strong>Coupang, Inc.</strong> <strong>(</strong><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:CPNG;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/cpng/forecast\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>CPNG</strong></a><strong>)</strong>",
			"Accounting for the biggest holding in his portfolio (14.76%), and worth almost $350 million, the next Druckenmiller-endorsed stock we’ll look at is Coupang, the largest e-commerce platform in South Korea.",
			"Offering a range of products including electronics, clothing, beauty products, and groceries, Coupang is known for its unique same-day delivery service, which allows customers to often receive their orders within hours of placing them. The company has also expanded its services to include Coupang Eats, a food delivery service, and Coupang Play, a streaming service that offers movies, TV shows, and music. The company prides itself on its innovative and customer-centric approach which has made it one of the most valuable companies in South Korea, with a market cap over $30 billion.",
			"We’ll see Coupang’s 1Q23 results on May 9, but we can look back at its 4Q22 report for an idea of where the company stands. During that quarter, revenue climbed by 4.3% year-over-year to $5.3 billion, falling $70 million short of the consensus estimate. However, net income improved dramatically from a loss of $405 million in the year ago period to a record $102 million. This led to EPS of $0.06, surpassing the $0.05 consensus estimate.",
			"Among the bulls is Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Cha who thinks the risk-reward for Coupang is “skewed to the upside.”",
			"“The company’s continued momentum in gaining market share, as shown in the large gap between Coupang’s current market share (c.20% of domestic e-commerce TAM) and its share of growth (c.50%+), is backed by its defensive moat (i.e., nationwide coverage of next-day delivery and low ASP), and we think the market share gain momentum is offsetting industry headwinds as well as generating strong profitability improvement through economies of scale. Additionally, we believe Coupang appears poised to tap into other opportunities (e.g. fintech, OTT, overseas expansion, etc.),” Cha opined.",
			"How does this all translate to investors? Cha rates the shares a Buy and backs it up with a $26 price target, indicating a potential upside of ~52% from the current levels.",
			"Elsewhere on Wall Street, the stock garners an additional 7 Buys, 2 Holds and 1 Sell, all coalescing to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Shares are expected to change hands for a 23% premium a year from now, considering the average target currently stands at $21.12.

			"<strong>NOV Inc. </strong>NOV reported first-quarter 2023 adjusted net profit of 32 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents. The bottom line also turned around from the year-ago quarter’s loss of 13 cents.",
			"Total revenues of $2 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.4%. The figure also rose 26.4% from the year-ago quarter’s level of $1.5 billion.",
			"The improvement in both earnings and revenues can be attributed to the robust performance of NOV’s Rig Technologies and Completion &amp; Production Solutions segment.",
			"<strong>Rig Technologies: </strong>The unit reported first-quarter revenues of $550 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $545 million. The figure also exceeded the prior-year quarter’s figure of $441 million. Adjusted EBITDA of $69 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $64 million. The actuals also increased from $36 million recorded in the corresponding period of 2022.",
			"<strong>Wellbore Technologies: </strong>Revenues in this segment improved 22.5% to $745 million year over year. The figure, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $762 million. Adjusted EBITDA of $133 million increased from the year-earlier quarter’s level of $101 million but missed the consensus mark of $146 million. This could be due to ongoing supply-chain issues that hampered the segment’s drill pipe operations.",
			"<strong>Completion &amp; Production Solutions</strong>: The segment’s revenues rose 35.4% to $718 million year over year. The top line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $701 million. Adjusted EBITDA of $54 million increased from the year-ago quarter’s level of $10 million. The figure also exceeded the consensus mark of $52 million, primarily due to better management of the ongoing supply-chain disruptions, an improved product mix and better execution of the company’s manufacturing plans.",
			"At the end of March 2023, order backlog for Rig Technologies’ capital equipment was $2.88 billion, including $251 million worth of new orders. The same for the Completion &amp; Production Solutions segment was $1.60 billion, comprising $407 million worth of new orders.",
			"As of Mar 31, 2023, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $774 million and long-term debt of $1.73 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 24.5%.",
			"Despite recent weakness in commodity prices, NOV's outlook for 2023 is positive for each of the three segments.",
			"The company expects its floating rig count to recover soon from the pandemic. Based on the FID projection and current contracting rate, many more rigs are likely to be in demand by 2024.",
			"For the second quarter, the company expects a mid-single-digit increase in revenues from the Completion &amp; Production Solutions segment. It also anticipates EBITDA flow-through in the lower 30% range and EBITDA margin in low-double digits for 2023.",
			"Activity growth in the Eastern Hemisphere and drill pipe manufacturing operations in Wellbore Technologies are expected to offset headwinds from softening activity in North America.  This, in turn, is anticipated to cause a sequential revenue improvement in the mid-single-digit percent range for the second quarter.",
			"The company also expects an inventory rise in the Rig Technologies segment. This is due to the flow of castings and forgings needed to support the unit’s backlog of spare parts, rig refurbishment and equipment repair. This inventory growth is expected to boost revenues in the second quarter and beyond.",
			"This business unit is also expected to gain from increased activity in the Eastern Hemisphere and the recapture of additional high-spec drilling motor market share.",
			"NOV is gaining wider adoption of its digital solutions through several agreements, including a recent global contract with a major integrated oil company to provide edge computing, edge-to-cloud and cloud-based solutions.",
			"The company expects continued market share gains in North America, and incremental activities in the Gulf of Mexico and international markets for 2023.",
			"It anticipates free cash flow in the range of $100-$300 million.",
			"Currently, NOV carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Some other top-ranked stocks for investors interested in the <strong>energy</strong> sector are <strong>CVR Energy </strong>CVI, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and <strong>Marathon Petroleum </strong>MPC and <strong>Ranger Energy Services </strong>RNGR, each holding a Zacks Rank #2 at present.

			"The company currently has a forward P/E ratio of 6.59. In comparison, its industry has an average forward P/E of 8.60, which means CVI is trading at a discount to the group.",
			"<strong>Marathon Petroleum: </strong>MPC is valued at around $58.02 billion. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 20.91% for the last four quarters and its current dividend yield is 2.30%.",
			"The company currently has a forward P/E ratio of 6.36. In comparison, its industry has an average forward P/E of 9.10, which means MPC is trading at a discount to the group.",

			"<strong>Operator:</strong> Hello, and welcome to the Energy Transfer Q1 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note today's event is being recorded. And now, I'd like to turn the conference over to your host today, Tom Long. Sir, please go ahead.",
			"<strong>Tom Long:</strong> Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Energy Transfer first quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm also joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon as well as the slides posted to our website. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, which we expect to file this Thursday, May 4.",
			"I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website. I'd like to start today by going over our financial results. We were pleased with our results for the first quarter of 2023. During which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $3.43 billion, which was up from $3.34 billion for the first quarter of 2022. Results for the first quarter benefited from record volumes across our interstate and midstream segments, as well as through our NGL pipelines and NGL and refined products terminals, which included a record amount of LPGs exported out of our Nederland terminal and a record amount of ethane exported out of both Netherlands and Marcus Hook terminals during the quarter.",
			"DCF attributable to the partners of Energy Transfer, as adjusted, was $2.01 billion compared to $2.08 billion for the first quarter of 2022. This resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of $1.04 billion. On an incurred basis, we had excess DCF of $64 million after distributions of $967 million and growth capital of $407 million. On April 26, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.3075 per common unit or $1.23 on an annualized basis. This distribution represents an increase from $0.3050 per common unit paid for the fourth quarter of 2022. Although we cannot guarantee future performance, we expect to make ongoing quarterly increases to our common unit distribution of a $0.0025 on a quarterly basis or $0.01 on an annualized basis and we are now targeting 3% to 5% annual distribution growth rate.",
			"This targeted growth rate allows us to provide some clarity to our equity holders on future distributions. We continue to balance our leverage reduction and increasing equity returns, all while maintaining sufficient cash flow to invest in our incredible backlog of growth opportunities. Inclusive of the targeted distribution growth rate, we still expect to be at the lower end of our 4 times to 4.5 times leverage ratio target range going forward based on our calculation of the rating agencies' leverage ratios. As of March 31, 2023, the total available liquidity under our revolving credit facility was approximately $3.01 billion. Now turning to results by segment for the first quarter, I'll start with NGL and refined products. Adjusted EBITDA was $939 million compared to $700 million for the same period last year.",
			"This change was primarily due to higher margins from transportation, fractionation, storage and terminal services, as well as an increase in northeast blending and optimization. Also included in the increase was approximately $50 million from the recognition of gains on hedged NGL inventory which is primarily related to the physical loss recorded in the third quarter of last year. NGL transportation volumes on our wholly owned and joint venture pipelines increased 13% to a record 2 million barrels per day compared to 1.8 million barrels per day for the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to higher volumes from the Permian region and our Mariner East pipeline system, as well as on our NGL pipelines that deliver into our Nederland Terminal.",
			"Average fractionated volumes increased 18% to an average 949,000 barrels per day compared to 804,000 barrels per day for the first quarter of 2022. NGL export volumes grew more than 20% over the first quarter of 2022, driven by record ethane and LPG exports out of our Nederland Terminal as well as record ethane exports out of the Marcus Hook terminal. This was primarily driven by the second tranche of satellite's contract going into effect on July 1, as well as increased international demand for natural gas liquids. In the first quarter, we loaded more than 14 million barrels of ethane out of Nederland. In total, we continue to export more NGL than any other company or country with our percentage of worldwide NGL exports remaining at approximately 20% of the global market.",
			"For midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $641 million compared to $807 million for the first quarter 2022. This was primarily due to the lower natural gas and NGL prices, as well as increased operating expenses, which were partially offset by increased throughput in all of our operating regions. In addition, the first quarter of 2023 included a onetime positive adjustment of approximately $40 million. Gathered gas volumes increased 14% to a record 19.8 million MMBtus per day compared to 17.3 million MMBtus per day for the same period last year. For the crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $526 million compared to $593 million for the same period last year. This was primarily due to lower volumes on the Bakken Pipeline and lower optimization gains compared to the first quarter of 2022.",
			"Photo by Ronan Furuta on Unsplash",
			"The reduction in optimization was entirely attributable to the timing differences between physical and financial settlements. We expect to recognize $25 million gain in the second quarter related to this activity. In addition, the first quarter of 2023 included a onetime negative adjustment of approximately $35 million. These were partially offset by higher throughput on several of our pipeline systems and higher export demand. Crude oil transportation volumes were 4.24 million barrels per day compared to 4.22 million barrel per day for the same period last year. This was a result of higher volumes on our Texas pipeline systems and the Bayou Bridge pipeline, as well as placing the Ted Collins Link pipeline into service in the second quarter of 2022, which were offset by lower volumes on the Bakken Pipeline as a result of weather related production impacts.",
			"In the Interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $536 million compared to $453 million for the first quarter of 2022. This was due to increased transportation revenue related to higher contracted volumes and rates on several of our wholly owned and joint venture pipelines, as well as placing the Gulf Run Pipeline into service in December of 2022. Volumes increased 11% over the same period last year due to the Gulf Run pipeline being placed into service, as well as higher utilization on many of our Interstate pipelines, including Transwestern, (ph), Trunkline, MEP and (ph). And for our Intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $409 million compared to $444 million in the first quarter of last year. This was due to lower pipeline optimization opportunities and decreased retained fuel revenues related to lower natural gas prices, which were partially offset by increased storage optimization opportunities and higher fees on assets in the Haynesville and Oklahoma.",
			"Utilization on our EOIT, HPL and Rig Systems increased due to higher demand from gas takeaway from growing production in a number of our operating basins. Looking briefly at recent developments, we are excited about the closing of our acquisition of Lotus Midstream for approximately $900 million in cash and 44.5 million Energy Transfer common units. Lotus owns and operates (ph) Pipeline, a fully integrated crude pipeline terminal system in the Permian Basin. This acquisition will enhance Energy Transfer's crude pipeline footprint across the Permian Basin with the addition of approximately 3,000 miles of crude gathering and transportation lines that extend from Southeast Mexico to Cushing, Oklahoma. In addition, the assets provide direct access to other major hubs including Midland, Colorado City, Wink and Crane, and will increase our storage capacity at Midland by approximately 2 million barrels per day.",
			"Now turning to our growth projects. I'll start with an update on our Lake Charles LNG project. In May 2022, we received an extension from FERC of the deadline for completion of the construction of Lake Charles LNG facility to December of 2028. And in June 2022, we applied to the Department of Energy. As many are now aware, on April 25, the Department of Energy denied our request for this extension. We strongly disagree with this decision and we plan to file an appeal with the DOE within 30 days of the DOE decision. Now turning to Nederland and Marcus Hook export terminals. NGL demand both in the U.S. as well as from international customers continues to increase. We are bullish that there will be significant growth in the international demand for many years to come and we are well positioned to benefit from that demand.",
			"In order to address this growth, we have recently FID and expansion to our NGL export capacity at Nederland which we expect to add up to 250,000 barrels per day of export capacity. This expansion which is projected to cost approximately $1.25 billion will give us tremendous flexibility to load different products as well as new products based upon customer demand and market dynamics at the time. The expansion is expected to be in service in mid-2025. We look forward to providing more specifics on this expansion in the near future. We also continue to pursue an optimization project at our Marcus Hook Terminal would add incremental ethane refrigeration and storage capacity. Next at Mont Belvieu, fractionation throughput averaged over 1 million barrels per day for the month of April, which is a new monthly record.",
			"And we continue to expect frac eight to be in service in the third quarter of 2023. This addition will bring our total Mont Belvieu fractionation capacity to approximately $1.15 million barrels per day. And in the Delaware Basin, we placed our 200 million cubic foot per day Grey Wolf processing plant into service in December of 2022. As a reminder, this plant is supported by new commitments and growth from existing customer contracts. And construction continues on the Bear plant, our eighth 200 million cubic foot per day processing plant in the Delaware Basin. This plant remains on schedule to be in service in the second quarter of 2023. In addition, we continue to evaluate the necessity and potential time of adding another processing plant in the Permian Basin.",
			"Regarding Permian takeaway, we also completed modernization and debottlenecking work on our Oasis pipeline during the first quarter, which added at least an incremental 60,000 Mcf per day of takeaway capacity out of the Permian Basin. We also placed the Gulf Run pipeline into service in December of 2022. Gulf Run provides natural gas transportation between our upstream pipeline network and from the Haynesville, Shell for delivery to the Gulf Coast connecting some of the most prolific natural gas producing regions in the U.S. with the LNG export market, as well as many markets along the Gulf Coast. We were already utilizing a significant portion of Zone 1 capacity on Gulf Run and we have added additional customer commitments through Zone 2, which is being delivered into our trunk line pipeline.",
			"In addition to these ongoing projects, we continue to evaluate a number of other potential growth projects that over the long term could provide strong returns and significant upside to our business. We remain optimistic that we can bring these projects to FID and will share any significant updates on these potential projects at the appropriate time. One the Alternative Energy front, we continue to make progress on our carbon capture and storage project with CapturePoint that is related to our north Louisiana treating plants. A Class 6 permit for this sequestration site was filed by CapturePoint with the EPA in June of 2022. Also we recently executed a letter of intent with Oxy related to Oxy's Magnolia hub in Allen Parish, Louisiana, north of the Lake Charles Industrial Complex.",
			"Pursuant to the letter of intent, Energy Transfer and Oxy are working together to obtain long term commitments of CO2 from industrial customers in the Lake Charles, Louisiana area. If this project reaches FID, Energy Transfer would construct a CO2 pipeline to connect the customers in Oxy's sequestration site in Allan Parish, Louisiana. Now looking at our growth capital project for the first quarter ended March 31, 2023, Energy Transfer spent $407 million on organic growth projects, primarily in the midstream and NGL and Refined Products segment, excluding SUN and USA Compression CapEx. For full year 2023, we now expect growth capital expenditures to be approximately $2 billion, which will be spent primarily in the midstream, NGL and refined products and Interstate segments.",
			"This capital outlook has been updated to include the NGL export expansion project at Nederland, as well as the expenditures related to the Lotus acquisition. A significant amount of our 2023 growth capital spend is comprised of projects that are expected to be online and contributing cash flow before the end of 2023 at very attractive returns, including frac 8, the Bear processing plant and new treating capacity in the Haynesville. Now for our adjusted EBITDA guidance, we are updating our guidance to include EBITDA associated with the Lotus acquisition. As a result, we now expect our 2023 adjusted EBITDA to be between $13.05 billion and $13.45 billion. As a reminder, with the current forward curve for commodity prices and spreads, our guidance does not assume the same upside benefits from pricing and spreads that we experienced in 2022.",
			"Our base business continues to provide stable cash flows and demonstrates our ability to operate through various market cycles and we expect utilization in all of our core segments to increase. In addition, we continue to create opportunities for optimization and expansion driven by sustained domestic and international demand for our products and services. We remain bullish about the future of our industry and the growing worldwide demand for all of our products. As part of our capital allocation strategy, we will continue to look for new ways to address this demand through the pursuit of strategic growth projects that enhance our existing asset base and generate attractive returns. In addition, we will continue to place emphasis on strategically allocating cash flow in a manner that balances our targeted 3% to 5% annual distribution growth rate and our commitment to our 4 times to 4.5 times leverage target, all while maintaining significant free cash flow for growth.",

Coal and natural gas took the lead in this decline, with the former declining by 34.8% and the latter falling by 27.2% over the same period. However, when it comes to price changes for non-energy commodities over this period, it was seen that there were minimal price changes. Food and beverage prices actually rose by 1% and 5.2%, respectively, while raw materials prices eased by 0.9%. Through all these price fluctuations, commodity stocks such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:XOM;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"http://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/exxon+mobil+corp/34088/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">XOM</a>), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:GOLD;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"http://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/barrick+gold+corp/756894/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GOLD</a>), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:CVX;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"http://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/chevron+corp/93410/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVX</a>) have gone through immense turbulence. Regardless, with commodity prices for some commodities still on the rise, these stocks remain well-placed to benefit in 2023.",
			"Such optimism surrounding the commodity sector is supported by the outlook for this sector in 2023. According to a Goldman Sachs <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:report;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/gs-research/2023-commodity-outlook-an-underinvested-supercycle/report.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> published in December 2022, commodities proved to be the best-performing asset class in 2022 despite price declines. By December, commodities had generated 20% returns, for instance. 2022 was the second year where commodities managed to perform this well since they generated returns of 42% in 2021 as well. Based on these trends, alongside European improvements in energy efficiency and slowing Fed rate hikes in the US, Goldman Sachs analysts expect the commodity sector to return 43% in 2023 as well.",
			"With price fluctuations where commodity prices often spike higher and the supply of commodities often not able to meet demand, a need to increase investment in the commodity sector has been identified by experts at Goldman Sachs. Higher commodity prices signal their scarcity, while the fact that commodities have been outperforming other asset classes signifies that investors should direct more capital into this sector. Greater capital is the only thing that can help raise the supply of commodities and rebalance the physical economy. The commodity sector has issued calls for capital in the past as well - first in the 1970s, then in the 2000s, and now in the 2020s. This indicates the importance of continued investment in this sector, leading us to compile a list of the best commodity stocks to buy today.",

			"ANN’S GROVE, Guyana (AP) — Villagers in this tiny coastal community lined up on the soggy grass, leaned into the microphone and shared their grievances as someone in the crowd yelled, “Speak the truth!”",
			"And so they did. One by one, speakers listed what they wanted: a library, streetlights, school buses, homes, a grocery store, reliable electricity, wider roads and better bridges.",
			"“Please help us,” said Evadne Pellew-Fomundam — a 70-year-old who lives in Ann’s Grove, one of Guyana’s poorest communities — to the country's prime minister and other officials who organized the meeting to hear people's concerns and boost their party's image ahead of municipal elections.",
			"The list of needs is long in this <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:South American country;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/guyana\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">South American country</a> of 791,000 people that is poised to become the world’s fourth-largest offshore oil producer, placing it ahead of Qatar, the United States, Mexico and Norway. The oil boom will generate billions of dollars for this largely impoverished nation. It's also certain to spark bitter fights over how the wealth should be spent in a place where politics is sharply divided along ethnic lines: 29% of the population is of African descent and 40% of East Indian descent, from indentured servants brought to Guyana after slavery was abolished.",
			"Change is already visible in this country, which has a rich Caribbean culture and was once known as the “Venice of the West Indies.” Guyana is crisscrossed by canals and dotted with villages called “Now or Never” and “Free and Easy\" that now co-exist with gated communities with names like “Windsor Estates.” In the capital, Georgetown, buildings made of glass, steel and concrete rise above colonial-era wooden structures, with shuttered sash windows, that are slowly decaying. Farmers are planting broccoli and other new crops, restaurants offer better cuts of meat, and the government has hired a European company to produce local sausages as foreign workers transform Guyana’s consumption profile.",
			"With $1.6 billion in oil revenue so far, the government has launched infrastructure projects including the construction of 12 hospitals, seven hotels, scores of schools, two main highways, its first deep-water port and <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:a $1.9 billion gas-to-energy project;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-caribbean-guyana-faafb81638dafd513265843715ea1555\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a $1.9 billion gas-to-energy project</a> that Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo told The Associated Press will double Guyana’s energy output and slash high power bills by half.",
			"And while the projects have created jobs, it’s rare for Guyanese to work directly in the oil industry. The work to dig deep into the ocean floor is highly technical, and the country doesn't offer such training.",
			"Experts worry that Guyana lacks the expertise and legal and regulatory framework to handle the influx of wealth. They say it could weaken democratic institutions and lead the country on a path like that of <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:neighboring Venezuela;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-corruption-oil-maduro-e4bb5d055f16eae94c9bcec6c7a6dbf5\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">neighboring Venezuela</a>, a petrostate that plunged into political and economic chaos.",
			"“Guyana’s political instability raises concerns that the country is unprepared for its newfound wealth without a plan to manage the new revenue and equitably disburse the financial benefits,” according to a USAID report that acknowledged the country's deep ethnic rivalries.",
			"A consortium led by <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:ExxonMobil;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/exxon-mobil-corp\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ExxonMobil</a> discovered the first major oil deposits in May 2015 more than 100 miles (190 kilometers) off Guyana, one of the poorest countries in South America despite its large reserves of gold, diamond and bauxite. More than 40% of the population lived on less than $5.50 a day when production began in December 2019, with some 380,000 barrels a day expected to soar to 1.2 million by 2027.",
			"A single oil block of more than a dozen off Guyana’s coast is valued at $41 billion. Combined with <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:additional oil deposits found nearby;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/guyana-exxon-mobil-corp-business-caribbean-hess-990ec8c761eb1350a08b0c2b8acceaf6\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">additional oil deposits found nearby</a>, that will generate an estimated $10 billion annually for the government, according to USAID. That figure is expected to jump to $157 billion by 2040, said Rystad Energy, a Norwegian-based independent energy consultancy.",
			"Guyana, which has one of the world’s highest emigration rates with more than 55% of the population living abroad, now claims one of the world’s largest shares of oil per capita. It's expected to have one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, too, according to a World Bank report.",
			"The transformation has lured back Guyanese such as Andrew Rampersaud, a 50-year-old goldsmith who left Trinidad last July with his wife and four daughters, encouraged by changes he saw in his country.",
			"He makes some 20 pairs of earrings and four necklaces a day, mostly with Guyanese gold, but where he's really noticed a difference is in real estate. Rampersaud owns seven rental units, and before the oil discovery, he'd get a query every month or so.",
			"Now, three to four people call daily. And, unlike before, they always pay on time in a country where a two-bedroom apartment now costs $900, triple the price in in 2010, according to Guyana’s Real Estate Association.",
			"But many Guyanese, including those living in Ann’s Grove, wonder whether their community will ever see some of that wealth. Here, bleating goats amble down the village’s main road, wide enough for a single car or the occasional horse-drawn cart. Dogs dart through wooden homes with zinc roofs, and the sole marketplace where vendors once sold fruits and vegetables is now a makeshift brothel.",
			"“I expected a better life since the drilling began,” said Felasha Duncan, a 36-year-old mother of three who spoke as she got bright pink extensions braided into her hair at an open-air salon.",
			"Down the road, 31-year-old Ron Collins was busy making cinderblocks and said he didn’t bother attending the recent Saturday morning meeting with officials.",
			"“It makes no sense,” he said, leaning on his shovel.",
			"He doesn’t believe his village will benefit from the ongoing projects that have employed people such as Shaquiel Pereira, who's helping build one of the new highways and earning double what he did three months ago as an electrician. The 25-year-old bought land in western Guyana last month and is now saving to build his first home and buy a new car.",
			"“I feel hopeful,” he said as he scanned the new highway from his car, pausing before the hourlong drive home.",
			"His boss, engineer Arif Hafeez, said that while people aren't seeing oil money directly in their pockets by way of public wage increases, construction projects are generating jobs and new roads will boost the economy.",
			"“They say it’s going to look like Dubai, but I don’t know about that,” he said with a laugh.",
			"At a job fair at the University of Guyana, excitement and curiosity were in the air as students met with oil companies, support and services firms, and agricultural groups.",
			"Greeting students was Sherry Thompson, 43, a former hospital switchboard operator and manager of a local inn who joined a company that provides services such as transportation for vice presidents of major oil companies.",
			"“I felt like my life was going nowhere, and I wanted a future for myself,” Thompson said.",
			"Jobs like hers have become plentiful, but it’s rare to find Guyanese working directly in the oil industry.",
			"Richie Bachan, 47, is among the exceptions. As a former construction worker, he had the foundation, with some additional training, to begin working as a roustabout, assembling and repairing equipment in the offshore oil industry two years ago. His salary tripled, and his family benefits: “We eat better. We dress better. We can keep up with our bills.”",
			"But beyond the slate of infrastructure projects and jobs they’re creating, experts warn the huge windfall could overwhelm Guyana.",
			"“The country isn’t preparing and wasn’t prepared for the sudden discovery of oil,” said Lucas Perelló, a political science professor at New York’s Skidmore College.",
			"Three years after the 2015 oil discovery, a political crisis erupted in Guyana, which is dominated by two main parties: the Indo-Guyanese People’s Progressive Party and the Afro-Guyanese People’s National Congress, which formed a coalition with other parties.",
			"That coalition was dissolved after a no-confidence motion <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:approved by a single vote;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/latin-america-caribbean-guyana-077cb3ec62784a73b09362578c09a5ae\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">approved by a single vote</a> in 2018 gave way to snap general elections in 2020. Those saw the Indo-Guyanese People’s Progressive Party win by one seat in a race that's still being contested in court.",
			"“That’s why the 2020 elections were so important. Everyone knew what was at stake,” Perelló said.",
			"The USAID report accused the previous administration of a lack of transparency in negotiations and oil deals with investors, adding that the “tremendous influx of money opens many avenues for corruption.”",
			"When The Associated Press asked Prime Minister Mark Phillips about concerns over corruption, his press officers tried to end the interview before he interjected, saying his party had a zero-tolerance policy: “Wherever corruption exists, we are committed to rooting it out.”",
			"Guyana signed the deal in 2016 with the ExxonMobil consortium, which includes Hess Corporation and China’s CNOOC, but did not make the contract public until 2017 despite demands to release it immediately.",
			"The contract dictates that Guyana would receive 50% of the profits, compared with other deals in which Brazil obtained 61% and the U.S. 40%, according to Rystad Energy. But many have criticized that Guyana would only earn 2% royalties, something Jagdeo said the current government would seek to increase to 10% for future deals.",
			"“The contract is front-loaded, one-sided and riddled with tax, decommissioning and other loopholes that favor the oil companies,” according to a report from the Ohio-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
			"Aubrey Norton, leader of the opposition People’s National Congress that was part of the coalition that signed the deal, told AP that it made mistakes: “I have no doubt about that. And therefore, moving forward, we should rectify those mistakes.\"",
			"Activists also have raised concerns that the oil boom will contribute to climate change, given that one barrel of fuel oil produces on average about 940 pounds (about 425 kilograms) of carbon dioxide, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.",
			"AP reached out to ExxonMobil spokeswoman Meghan Macdonald for comment about how the company handled the deal in Guyana and environmental concerns, and unsuccessfully sought to arrange an interview with the company’s top official in the country. Macdonald said in a statement that the terms of the company’s agreement with the government “are competitive with other countries at a similar stage of resource discovery.”",
			"Norton said he was concerned about the current government’s focus on building infrastructure instead of developing people, adding that he worries the oil wealth will intensify ethnic divisions in Guyana and create other problems: “It will result in the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.”",
			"Jagdeo, the vice president who once served as president, told AP that his party has created a special fund for oil revenues with safeguards to prevent corruption, including appointment of an independent monitor and a board of directors to oversee the fund along with the finance minister.",
			"Parliamentary approval also is needed to decide how the funds would be used, he said, adding that oil revenues currently represent only a third of Guyana’s budget and that increases in salaries might happen later: “At this point in time, we are not awash with money.”",
			"“We have seen the mistakes made by other countries,” he said. “We have to be cautious.”",
			"Despite the oil boom, poverty is deepening for some as the cost of living soars, with goods such as sugar, oranges, cooking oil, peppers and plantains more than doubling in price while salaries have flatlined.",
			"Many are still scraping by, like Samuel Arthur, who makes $100 a month selling large, heavy-duty plastic bags in Georgetown and other areas, hauling some 40 pounds of weight every day.",
			"“All we live on is promises,” he said of the oil boom. “I have to do this because I don’t have any other way to survive.”",
			"It’s the kind of need familiar to many in Ann’s Grove.",
			"When the meeting between residents and officials ended, the prime minister pledged that most requests would be fulfilled.",
			"“Looking forward to your promise,” resident Clyde Wickham said. Officials nodded and vowed to return with more details on how they'll help Ann's Grove.",
			"Hopeful residents clapped. Like Wickham, many say they'll work to hold the government to its word."

			"What trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing <em>return</em> on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing <em>base</em> of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in <strong>EOG Resources'</strong> (<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:NYSE:EOG;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-eog/eog-resources?blueprint=2492813&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=intro&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NYSE:EOG</a>) returns on capital, so let's have a look.",
			"Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for EOG Resources:",
			"<strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong>",
			"0.28 = US$9.9b ÷ (US$41b - US$5.5b) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022)</em>.",
			"So, <strong>EOG Resources has an ROCE of 28%. </strong> That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 21% earned by companies in a similar industry.",
			"<span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:See our latest analysis for EOG Resources;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/energy/nyse-eog/eog-resources?blueprint=2492813&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for EOG Resources </a></span>",

			"The trends we've noticed at EOG Resources are quite reassuring. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 28%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 32%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at EOG Resources thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.",
			"To sum it up, EOG Resources has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. Investors may not be impressed by the favorable underlying trends yet because over the last five years the stock has only returned 15% to shareholders. So exploring more about this stock could uncover a good opportunity, if the valuation and other metrics stack up.",

			"<b>Suncor Energy</b> (SU) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.",
			"Over the past month, shares of this energy company have returned -10.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - Canadian industry, which Suncor Energy falls in, has lost 16.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?",
			"Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.",
			"<b>Revisions to Earnings Estimates</b>",
			"Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.",
			"We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.",
			"Suncor Energy is expected to post earnings of $0.93 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -38.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.7%.",
			"The consensus earnings estimate of $3.95 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -38.5%. This estimate has changed -2.1% over the last 30 days.",
			"For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.22 indicates a change of +6.8% from what Suncor Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.7%.",
			"With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Suncor Energy.",
			"The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:",
			"<b>12 Month EPS</b>",
			"<b>Revenue Growth Forecast</b>",
			"While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.",
			"In the case of Suncor Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $7.77 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -27%. The $32.27 billion and $31.53 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -28.5% and -2.3%, respectively.",
			"<b>Last Reported Results and Surprise History</b>",
			"Suncor Energy reported revenues of $10.21 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.3%. EPS of $1.33 for the same period compares with $0.71 a year ago.",
			"Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.65 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.71%. The EPS surprise was +5.56%.",
			"The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.",
			"<b>Valuation</b>",
			"No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.",
			"Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.",
			"The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.",
			"Suncor Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.",
			"<b>Conclusion</b>",
			"The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Suncor Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.",

			"Although the midstream energy business is less exposed to oil and gas price volatility, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Pipeline MLP industry’s outlook is still subjected to uncertainties. Due to conservative capital spending by upstream players and possibilities for soft fuel demand, production volumes could get dented, hurting demand for partnerships’ midstream assets.<br/><br/>Despite the uncertainties, pipeline players are better off than upstream and downstream firms since the partnerships generate stable fee-based revenues from their long-term contracts with shippers. The industry frontrunners include <strong>Enterprise Products Partners LP</strong> EPD, <strong>Magellan Midstream Partners LP</strong> MMP and <strong>NuStar Energy LP </strong>NS.<br/>",
			"<b>About the Industry</b>",
			"The Zacks Oil and Gas - Pipeline MLP industry comprises master limited partnerships (or MLPs) that are primarily engaged in transporting oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and natural gas liquids (NGL) to consumers in North America. Apart from transporting the commodities, the partnerships have huge capacities to store oil, natural gas and petrochemical products.  The partnerships are thus providing midstream services to both producers and consumers of the commodities. The players generate stable fee-based revenues from all those transportation and storage assets. The services provided by the partnerships entail the gathering and processing of commodities. The integrated midstream energy players also generate cashflows from ownership interests in fractionators and condensate distillation facilities.",
			"<b>What's Shaping the Future of the Oil &amp; Gas Pipeline MLP Industry?</b>",
			"<strong><em>Soft Pipeline Demand:</em></strong> Inflationary environment is probably spurring a slowdown in the U.S. economy, which could hurt fuel demand. The uncertainty in fuel demand is likely to affect the production of the commodity, which in turn will lower the demand for oil pipeline assets of the partnerships.",
			"<strong><em>Lower Fee-Based Revenues: </em></strong>Soft demand for midstream assets will possibly ultimately lead to lower fee-based revenues for the master limited partnerships. Also, to sail through soft demand for pipeline networks, several energy players with midstream presence will likely be left with no option but to offer discounts to shippers.",
			"<strong><em>Shift to Renewables:</em></strong> Energy majors will increasingly face challenges in providing sustainable energy to the world while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, to address the issue of climate change, there will be a gradual shift from fossil fuel to renewable energy. This will lower the demand for the partnerships’ pipeline and storage networks for oil and natural gas.",
			"<strong><em>Explorers’ Conservative Capital Spending: </em></strong>Oil and gas exploration and production companies are facing heightened pressure from investors to focus on stockholders’ returns rather than production. This is hindering the production of commodities, thereby denting pipeline and storage assets.",
			"<b>Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Gloomy Outlook</b>",
			"The Zacks Oil and Gas - Pipeline MLP industry is a nine-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #190, which places it in the bottom 24% of more than 250 Zacks industries.",
			"The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bearish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.",
			"The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent stocks in aggregate. Before we present a few oil and gas pipeline MLPs that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and current valuation.",
			"<b>Industry Outperforms Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500</b>",
			"The Zacks Oil and Gas - Pipeline MLP industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year. The industry has gained 1% in the past year against a decline of 6.2% of the broader sector and 1.1% of the S&amp;P 500.",
			"<strong>One-Year Price Performance</strong>",
			"<b>Industry's Current Valuation</b>",
			"Since midstream-focused oil and gas partnerships use fixed-rate debt for the majority of their borrowings, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive stocks, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses.",
			"On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio, the industry is currently trading at 10.07X, lower than the S&amp;P 500’s 12.57X. It is, however, significantly above the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 2.76X.",
			"Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 15.93X and as low as 6.87X, with a median of 10.18X.",
			"<strong>Trailing 12-Month Enterprise Value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio</strong>",
			"<b>3 Oil &amp; Gas Pipeline MLPs Trying to Survive the Industry Challenges</b>",
			"<strong>Enterprise Products Partners LP:</strong> Enterprise Products is a leading North American midstream infrastructure provider, generating stable fee-based revenues from its network of NGL, crude oil, natural gas, petrochemicals and refined products pipelines, spreading across roughly 50,000 miles. Since Enterprise Products has among the highest credit ratings in the midstream space, it can lean on its strong balance sheet to survive any economic turmoils.",
			"Enterprise Products, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has witnessed upward earnings estimate revisions for 2023 in the past 30 days. Major capital growth projects worth $6.1 billion, currently under construction, have brightened its outlook.",
			"<strong>Price and Consensus: EPD</strong>",
			"<strong>NuStar Energy </strong><strong>LP:</strong> NuStar Energy is a well-known player in the midstream space for being the nation’s leading operator of pipeline network and liquids terminals. This depicts the stock’s stable business model for having significantly lower exposure to commodity price volatility.

			"The agreement, which will last through 2028 and requires Canadian regulatory approval, covers tolls charged on both the U.S. and Canadian portions of Enbridge's Mainline, which moves 3 million barrels a day from Western Canada to refineries in Eastern Canada and the U.S. Midwest. If approved, Enbridge would continue to ration space on an open-access, monthly basis.",

			"Scotiabank analyst Robert Hope said the settlement removes uncertainty that has weighed on Enbridge shares. The stock edged higher on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Thursday.",
			"Enbridge spent years trying to convince shippers and then the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) to allow it to sell space on the Mainline under long-term contracts. Some oil producers, like Canadian Natural Resources Ltd (CNRL), objected and the CER rejected the plan in 2021.",
			"\"It's positive,\" said CNRL President Tim McKay of the new deal. \"The parties got together and agreed on a fair tolling agreement.\"",
			"The Calgary-based company's rival, Canadian government-owned Trans Mountain, expects to complete expansion of its pipeline late this year and has sold 80% of that space under contract, giving it security during periods of spare capacity.",
			"As a result, the Mainline's utilization rate may drop to 95% from full, but expanding oil production and the Mainline's lower toll compared to Trans Mountain's will soon refill it, Gruending said.",
			"Enbridge expects to apply for approval to the CER in early fall, with the expectation that the settlement could be approved and implemented this year. The agreement covers 70% of Mainline deliveries, with the remaining 30% covered by a pre-existing agreement.",

			"(Bloomberg) -- Shell Plc posted a record first-quarter profit and maintained the pace of share buybacks as a strong trading performance and higher liquefied natural gas volumes offset lower energy prices.",
			"The company will repurchase a further $4 billion of shares, the same amount as in the prior period. That contrasts with UK peer BP Plc, which saw its share price drop more than 8% earlier this week when it announced a smaller buyback of $1.75 billion.",
			"It’s a difference that could help new Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan reinforce his message that Shell can stand above the competition by reliably delivering generous cash returns to investors.",
			"“Following BP’s cut to the buyback, we received many questions on what Shell would do this quarter given a weaker macro environment,” RBC analyst Biraj Borkhataria said in a note. “What was the fuss about?”",
			"Shell shares rose as much as 3.5% before paring gains to 2,354 pence as of 11:45 a.m. in London.",
			"The integrated gas business was a key part of the resilience of Shell’s profit. It posted adjusted earnings of $4.9 billion in the quarter, the second-best performance on record after the prior period. The price of the fuel was down from a year earlier as the energy crisis ebbed in Europe, but the company offset that with higher volumes and lower operating expenses.",
			"Crucial to that segment are Shell’s gas traders. While the company doesn’t break out trading’s contribution to earnings, the company said results were similar to the fourth quarter, when it was a main contributor to record profits for the unit.",
			"“Trading and more importantly optimization in general play a critical role in our business model today for the conventional energy,” Sawan said on a call with reporters. “But I think will play an even bigger role going forward as we look at new energies.”",
			"“Against a lower commodity-price backdrop in the first quarter, Shell’s wide beat with adjusted earnings at $9.65 billion, 20% ahead of consensus, and roughly in line with fourth-quarter levels, is largely a testament to the strength of its industry-leading global gas portfolio.” — Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Industry Analyst Will Hares",
			"Shell’s adjusted net income was $9.65 billion in the first quarter, an increase of 5.7% from $9.13 billion a year earlier. That was well ahead of even the highest analyst estimate and a record level for the first quarter. Net debt dropped to $44.2 billion, down more than $4 billion from a year ago.",
			"Production volumes of liquefied natural gas — which has become a key fuel for Europe after Russia cut gas exports — jumped 6% in the quarter with the Prelude facility in Australia returning to operations after maintenance, Shell said. Greater output driving earnings has been a theme this season with Exxon reporting it strongest-ever start to a year after a jump in oil production from new wells.",
			"Shell has scheduled an investor briefing for June when Sawan, who took over the top job at the beginning of the year, will lay out his own strategy. “We would expect any adjustment to the dividend or overall distribution framework to be left for the capital markets day,” said RBC’s Borkhataria.",

			"ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI) are among the largest oil and gas companies in the U.S. Yet both companies operate in different parts of the industry, and that makes a huge difference in how they make money. While one is directly exposed to commodity prices, the other is insulated from oil and gas price fluctuations to a large extent. Lee Samaha (ExxonMobil): While Kinder Morgan is an attractive buy in its own right, I think ExxonMobil is a better buy."

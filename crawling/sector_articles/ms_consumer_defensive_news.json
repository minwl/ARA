			"Clearance items are some of the best deals at Target, Palmer said, and they are marked down to certain levels in a certain order. \"First, items will get marked down to 15% or 30% off, then to 50% off and finally end up at 70% off,\" she said.",
			"If you're on the hunt for clearance items, they should be marked down in red or yellow stickers, according to Palmer. The new price and the percentage of the markdown will be in the top right-hand corner without a percent symbol.",
			"\"Check the number in the upper-right corner of the price tag,\" said Palmer. \"If it says '70,' it's been marked down to 70% off.\"",
			"If a price ends in $0.04, this usually indicates it's reached its lowest markdown.",
			"Want Halloween or Christmas decorations, Easter baskets or back-to-school items that are practically free? Wait a few days or a few weeks after the holiday to buy them.",
			"Holiday items will be cut by 50% the day after the holiday -- 30% for candy. But wait a week or so, and products could go down to 70% off. Then, a few days later, if anything is left, they'll go to 90% off, which is practically free.",
			"Here's a list of days and times of year that Target offers holiday sale prices, according to All Things Target:",
			"If you've done your pre-Target-run prep properly, you might have more than one coupon for a single item. No problem: Target lets you stack coupons.",

			"Even if you're not actually getting married or having a baby, creating a wedding or baby registry is a sneaky way you can save on big-ticket items.",

			"Stack the 15% off deal with the 5% you get for shopping with a REDcard and any Cartwheel discounts, and you can save big bucks.",
			"You can shave even more off your bill by buying discount gift cards at sites like Gift Card Granny or Raise. The cards are real gift cards that you use like cash, so the bonus is that the gift card savings are in addition to any savings with coupons or sales.",

If you are lucky enough to live near multiple Target stores, you can look and see where the best price is before heading out to shop. I will say that BrickSeek is not always 100% accurate, but it's a great resource.\"",

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 78% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).",
			"Institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's market cap fell by US$5.9b last week. However, the 0.9% one-year returns may have helped alleviate their overall losses. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.",

			"Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.",
			"As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Philip Morris International. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Philip Morris International's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.",
			"Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Philip Morris International. Capital Research and Management Company is currently the company's largest shareholder with 17% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.6% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.6% by the third-largest shareholder.",
			"Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 15 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.",
			"Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.",
			"While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.",
			"Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.",
			"Our information suggests that Philip Morris International Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$213m worth of shares.

			"<strong>TreeHouse Foods, Inc.</strong> THS started 2023 on a solid note, with the first-quarter top and bottom lines increasing year over year and cruising ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.<br/><br/>The company continued to gain from robust pricing actions to counter inflation. Despite a dynamic macro landscape, TreeHouse Foods witnessed supply-chain improvements, which helped it enhance services and cater to high customer demand.<br/><br/>The company remains well-placed for 2023 due to its actions to focus on greater-margin private-label snacking and beverage categories.",
			"TreeHouse Foods reported adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 68 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents. The bottom line grew significantly from the year-ago quarter’s loss of 16 cents.",
			"TreeHouse Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise<br/><br/>",
			"TreeHouse Foods, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | TreeHouse Foods, Inc. Quote",
			"Net sales of $894.8 million advanced 15.8% year over year and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $849 million.<br/><br/>Growth in net sales was mainly driven by favorable pricing actions undertaken to recover commodity inflation, along with improved services in most categories that enabled the company to cater to the high demand. This was somewhat offset by the exit of the lower-margin business, especially in Pickles.<br/><br/>The volume/mix fell 0.6%, whereas pricing increased 16.7%. Organic sales grew 16.1%. THS witnessed currency headwinds to the tune of 0.3%.<br/><br/>The gross margin of 17% expanded 4.2 percentage points from the year-ago quarter’s figure, mainly due to pricing actions to recover commodity and freight inflation and a positive category mix. These were somewhat offset by additional costs associated with investments to improve the supply chain and warehouse capacity.<br/><br/>Total operating expenses were $113 million, down from the $155 million reported in the year-ago quarter.<br/><br/>Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations came in at $90.6 million, up from $37.3 million in the year-ago period. The upside can be attributed to the same factors that drove the gross margin.",
			"TreeHouse Foods concluded the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $14.6 million, long-term debt of $1,432.5 million and total shareholders’ equity of $1,704.4 million. In the first three months of 2023, the company’s net cash used in operating activities was $30.9 million.<br/><br/>On Oct 3, 2022, THS concluded the sale of a significant portion of its Meal Preparation business, which included pasta, pourable and spoonable dressing, preserves, red sauces, syrup, dry blends and baking, dry dinners, pie filling, pita chips and other sauces. From the third quarter of 2022, the divested business is presented as discontinued operations.",
			"Management reiterated its fiscal 2023 guidance. For fiscal 2023, TreeHouse Foods expects net sales growth of 6-8% year over year to the $3.66-$3.73 billion band. Adjusted EBITDA is likely to be in the $345-$365 million range, up nearly 24% year over year at the midpoint.<br/><br/>In the first half of fiscal 2023, TreeHouse Foods anticipates revenues in the range of $1.705-$1.735 billion, suggesting 7.7-9.6% growth from the year-ago period.<br/><br/>For the second quarter of 2023, revenues are projected in the range of $810-$840 million, indicating flat to 4% growth from the second quarter of 2022. The company expects adjusted EBITDA in the band of $65-$80 million for the second quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin is likely to be 7.9-9.4% in the quarter, calling for a 130-280 bps improvement.<br/><br/>This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has risen 11.1% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 8.8% growth.",
			"Some better-ranked food stocks are <strong>Lamb Weston</strong> LW, <strong>General Mills </strong>GIS and <strong>Conagra Brands</strong> CAG.<br/><br/>Lamb Weston, which operates as a frozen potato product company, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). LW has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 47.6%, on average. You can see <strong>the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</strong><br/><br/>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lamb Weston’s current fiscal-year EPS suggests an increase of 116.8% from the year-ago reported number.<br/><br/>General Mills, a food and beverage product company, currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). GIS has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.1%, on average.<br/><br/>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Mills’ current fiscal-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 6.3% and 7.4%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figures.<br/><br/>Conagra Brands, which operates as a consumer-packaged goods food company, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. CAG has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 13.2%, on average.<br/><br/>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Conagra Brands’ current fiscal-year sales and earnings suggests increases of 7.1% and 16.5%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers.",

			"<b>Coca-Cola</b> (KO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.",
			"Shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned +2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.2% change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which Coke belongs, has gained 5.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?",
			"Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.",
			"<b>Earnings Estimate Revisions</b>",
			"Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.",
			"We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.",
			"For the current quarter, Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.72 per share, indicating a change of +2.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.5% over the last 30 days.",
			"For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.60 points to a change of +4.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.2%.",
			"For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.80 indicates a change of +7.4% from what Coke is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.",
			"Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Coke is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",
			"The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:",
			"<b>12 Month EPS</b>",
			"<b>Revenue Growth Forecast</b>",
			"Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.",
			"In the case of Coke, the consensus sales estimate of $11.7 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.3%. The $44.96 billion and $47.23 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.6% and +5%, respectively.",
			"<b>Last Reported Results and Surprise History</b>",
			"Coke reported revenues of $10.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.7%. EPS of $0.68 for the same period compares with $0.64 a year ago.",
			"Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.87 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1%. The EPS surprise was +4.62%.",
			"Over the last four quarters, Coke surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.",
			"<b>Valuation</b>",
			"No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.",
			"While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.",
			"The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.",
			"Coke is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.",
			"<b>Bottom Line</b>",
			"The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coke. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.",

			"Socially responsible investing is quickly becoming a norm rather than an exception as more and more people understand the importance of taking into account social conscience when making investment decisions. <a class=\"link yahoo-link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Socially responsible investing;elm:context_link;itc:0;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-best-ethical-companies-invest-181936013.html\">Socially responsible investing</a> includes investing in companies that adhere to ethical or socially conscious business practices or steer clear of businesses or actions that harm the society according to many, including tobacco, alcohol, gambling, weapons, carbon emissions, child labor, etc. Socially responsible investing, ESG investing and impact investing have all seen a huge rise in popularity over the past few years.",
			"According to estimates from Bloomberg Intelligence, assets in the ESG space were expected to reach $41 trillion by the end of 2022. Historically, Europe has been at the forefront of ESG policy making and ESG investing but the Bloomberg report said that the US is now leading the investments in the ESG space.",
			"One of the most important trends seen in the socially responsible investing or ESG investing circles is the rise of ETFs and mutual funds. These give individual investors an easy and cost-effective way to have exposure to socially responsible companies. As an individual investors it’s difficult to find which companies are sticking to socially responsible business practices and ESG goals. So why not leave this legwork to the experts and just put your money into an ETF or mutual fund that is focused on finding such companies? The Bloomberg report cited data from Morningstar, which says that money held in ESG ETFs and sustainable mutual funds worldwide jumped 53% in 2021 to reach $2.7 trillion.",
			"As investors grow socially conscious, hedge funds are also upping their activism in the space and many companies are facing heat from ESG-focused hedge funds that are forcing companies to get their act together and stick to environment-friendly business practices. For example, environment-focused fund Engine No. 1 in 2021 managed to defeat oil giant ExxonMobil and installed its two members on the company’s board. The fund, which was not popular until this victory, received support from some of the biggest institutional investors of ExxonMobil, including BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. This shows the massive change ESG investing is ushering in at the Wall Street and how many investment firms and companies either willingly or unwillingly have to give in to this pressure.",
			"Engine No.1 in a scathing <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:letter;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://reenergizexom.com/materials/letter-to-the-board-of-directors-february-22\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">letter</a> to ExxonMobil’s board of directors criticized the company’s lack of adherence to its goals and targets related to climate. Here’s what the historic letter said:",
			"But not all is good and rosy for the ESG investing world. ESG investors and climate activist funds are facing a backlash from some circles and ESG funds also saw a huge exodus of investors amid losses and tough macro backdrop.",
			"For example, the iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF assets have dropped to $13.8 billion from $25 billion recorded a year ago, according to a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Bloomberg report;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-30/why-esg-in-america-may-face-a-rough-road-ahead-this-year?leadSource=uverify%20wall\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg report</a>. The report said that as of March 2023, global assets of ESG ETFs were about $471 billion, as compared to $486 billion recorded in January. The report said that investors pulled a whopping $4.4 billion in a single week in March.",
			"The report also said the industry was facing a “concentration” problem, in which a handful of major funds were invested in the ESG space and when a single major fund decides to pull money from a fund, the overall industry sees a decline.",
			"Some investors are also getting frustrated with what they believe an overemphasis on environment in the ESG spectrum. Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones, who is the cofounder of  Just Capital, believes worker treatment should be the center of the ESG equation and not the environment.",
			"According to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNBC;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/11/paul-tudor-jones-hedge-fund-billionaire-wants-to-do-away-with-esg.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC</a>, Jones said:",

			"The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Mastercard Inc., The Coca-Cola Co. and T-Mobile US, Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.<br/><br/>You can <strong>see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong><br/><br/><strong>Mastercard</strong> shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+18.0% vs. +10.2%). The company's numerous acquisitions are helping it to grow addressable markets and drive new revenue streams. We expect the company's top line at $25.2 billion in 2023. The COVID-19 crisis accelerated the adoption of digital and contactless solutions, providing an opportunity for MA's business to expedite its shift to the digital mode.<br/><br/>Mastercard is well-poised to gain from steady cash-generating abilities. A strong capital position allows it to pursue acquisitions and prudently deploy capital.<br/><br/>However, steep operating expenses might stress margins. High rebates and incentives may weigh on the company's net revenues. Its dividend yield is still lower than the industry average. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.<br/><br/>(You can <strong>read the full research report on Mastercard here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br/><br/>Shares of <strong>Coca-Cola</strong> have gained +1.4% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry's gain of +10.3%. The company's earnings and sales improved year over year and surpassed the Zacks analyst estimates in the quarter. KO's results benefited from the continued momentum in its business.<br/><br/>Sales gained from revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and a rise in concentrate sales. It is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments. It provided an upbeat guidance for 2023.<br/><br/>However, shares of Coca-Cola lagged the industry in the past three months. Pressures from higher supply chain costs, higher marketing spends and currency headwinds are concerning.<br/><br/>(You can <strong>read the full research report on Coca-Cola here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br/><br/>Shares of <strong>T-Mobile US</strong> have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+18.0% vs. -4.8%). With industry-leading growth in postpaid and broadband customers driven by superior 5G network and focus on customers, T-Mobile reported solid first-quarter 2023 results driven by diligent execution of operational plans.<br/><br/>The company has augmented its 5G footprint by introducing 5G Home Internet services in several states. T-Mobile plans to reach 300 million people within 2023. It intends to bring more competition to home broadband, especially in underserved rural markets.<br/><br/>However, T-Mobile operates in a fiercely competitive and almost saturated U.S. telecom market, which lowers its growth potential to some extent. Several promotional activities to lure additional customers are further eroding profitability. Lower equipment revenues due to a challenging macroeconomic environment remain a concern. Debt obligation woes also persist.<br/><br/>(You can <strong>read the full research report on T-Mobile US here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br/><br/>Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Shopify Inc. and EOG Resources, Inc.",

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Costco Wholesale's;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nasdaq-cost/costco-wholesale?blueprint=2501315&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=intro&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Costco Wholesale's </a> ROE in this article.",

			"The <strong>formula for return on equity</strong> is:",
			"Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity",
			"So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Costco Wholesale is:",
			"27% = US$6.1b ÷ US$23b (Based on the trailing twelve months to February 2023).",
			"The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.27.",
			"We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.",
			"To begin with, Costco Wholesale has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 11% which is quite remarkable. This probably laid the groundwork for Costco Wholesale's moderate 15% net income growth seen over the past five years.",
			"As a next step, we compared Costco Wholesale's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 11%.",
			"Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is COST fairly valued?

			"Costco Wholesale has a three-year median payout ratio of 26%, which implies that it retains the remaining 74% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.",
			"Additionally, Costco Wholesale has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 22%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Costco Wholesale's future ROE will be 25% which is again, similar to the current ROE.",
			"Overall, we are quite pleased with Costco Wholesale's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings.

			"<span><strong>Monday, May 8, 2023</strong><br/><br/>The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Mastercard Incorporated (MA), The Coca-Cola Company (KO) and T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.<br/><br/>You can <strong>see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong><br/><br/><strong>Mastercard</strong> shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+18.0% vs. +10.2%). Company’s numerous acquisitions are helping it to grow addressable markets and drive new revenue streams. We expect the company's top line at $25.2 billion in 2023. The COVID-19 crisis accelerated the adoption of digital and contactless solutions, providing an opportunity for MA's business to expedite its shift to the digital mode.<br/><br/>Mastercard is well-poised to gain from steady cash-generating abilities. A strong capital position allows it to pursue acquisitions and prudently deploy capital.<br/><br/>However, steep operating expenses might stress margins. High rebates and incentives may weigh on the company's net revenues. Its dividend yield is still lower than the industry average. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.<br/><br/>(You can <strong>read the full research report on Mastercard here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br/><br/>Shares of <strong>Coca-Cola</strong> have gained +1.4% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry’s gain of +10.3%. The company’s earnings and sales improved year over year and surpassed the Zacks analyst estimates in the quarter. KO’s results benefited from the continued momentum in its business.<br/><br/>Sales gained from revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and a rise in concentrate sales. It is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments. It provided an upbeat guidance for 2023.<br/><br/>However, shares of Coca-Cola lagged the industry in the past three months. Pressures from higher supply chain costs, higher marketing spends and currency headwinds are concerning.<br/><br/>(You can <strong>read the full research report on Coca-Cola here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br/><br/>Shares of <strong>T-Mobile US</strong> have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+18.0% vs. -4.8%). With industry-leading growth in postpaid and broadband customers driven by superior 5G network and focus on customers, T-Mobile reported solid first-quarter 2023 results driven by diligent execution of operational plans.<br/><br/>The company has augmented its 5G footprint by introducing 5G Home Internet services in several states. T-Mobile plans to reach 300 million people within 2023. It intends to bring more competition to home broadband, especially in underserved rural markets.<br/><br/>However, T-Mobile operates in a fiercely competitive and almost saturated U.S. telecom market, which lowers its growth potential to some extent. Several promotional activities to lure additional customers are further eroding profitability. Lower equipment revenues due to a challenging macroeconomic environment remain a concern. Debt obligation woes also persist.<br/><br/>(You can <strong>read the full research report on T-Mobile US here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br/><br/>Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Shopify Inc. (SHOP), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC) and EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG).<br/><br/>Director of Research<br/><br/>Sheraz Mian<br/><br/><em>Note: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings. He is frequently quoted in the print and electronic media and publishes the weekly <strong>Earnings Trends</strong> and <strong>Earnings Preview</strong> reports.

			"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.",
			"In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.",
			"However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.",
			"Colgate-Palmolive (CL) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.",
			"Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.",
			"Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this consumer products maker a great growth pick right now.",
			"<b>Earnings Growth</b>",
			"Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.",
			"While the historical EPS growth rate for Colgate-Palmolive is 1.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 5.4% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 1.9%.",
			"<b>Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio</b>",
			"Asset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.",
			"Right now, Colgate-Palmolive has an S/TA ratio of 1.15, which means that the company gets $1.15 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.92, it can be said that the company is more efficient.",
			"In addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Colgate-Palmolive is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 6% this year versus the industry average of 1.5%.",
			"<b>Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions</b>",
			"Beyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.",
			"The current-year earnings estimates for Colgate-Palmolive have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1% over the past month.",
			"<b>Bottom Line</b>",
			"Colgate-Palmolive has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.",
			"You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.",
			"This combination positions Colgate-Palmolive well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.",

			"Shares of <strong>Energizer Holdings, Inc.</strong> ENR rallied 5.7% during the pre-market trading session on May 8, following its second-quarter fiscal 2023 results. The company’s bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missed the same. However, the company’s top line declined year over year.<br/><br/>Shares of ENR have gained 15.6% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 5.5% growth.",
			"Energizer’s adjusted earnings of 64 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents and increased 36% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The bottom line also surpassed our consensus estimate of 50 cents.<br/><br/>ENR reported net sales of $684.1 million, falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $687 million and our estimate of $685.5 million. The top line also decreased 0.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reading. However, organic sales increased 2.6% in the quarter under review. This rise was driven by continued benefit of global pricing actions in the battery and auto care businesses, which contributed approximately 13% to organic sales. This upside was partially offset by declining volumes and management’s decision to exit certain low-margin profile battery customers and products, which further contributed to the decline.",
			" ",
			"Energizer Holdings, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Energizer Holdings, Inc. Quote",
			"On Oct 1, 2021, Energizer changed its segments from the two geographies of Americas and International to two reporting units, namely Battery &amp; Lights, and Auto Care. The move followed the acquisition of Spectrum Brands’ Battery and Auto Care units in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.<br/><br/>Energizer’s Batteries &amp; Lights segment’s revenues dipped from $516.5 million year over year to $505.9 million in second-quarter fiscal 2023 and lagged the consensus mark of $517.7 million. Meanwhile, revenues in the Auto Care segment increased from $168.9 million to $178.2 million and beat the consensus mark of $167.7 million.",
			"In the fiscal second quarter, Energizer’s adjusted gross margin expanded 300 basis points to 37.9%. This was mainly backed by continued gains from the pricing initiatives, Project Momentum savings of $10.7 million and favorable impact from exiting lower-margin businesses. Increased operating expenses, including material and ocean freight costs, inflationary trends, and currency headwinds, partly offset the increase.<br/><br/>Excluding restructuring costs, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) cost as a rate of sales was 17% compared with the 17.2% recorded in the prior-year quarter. On a dollar basis, SG&amp;A declined from $117.6 million to $116.5 million due to Project Momentum savings and favorable currency impacts. This was somewhat offset by increased stock-compensation amortization and factoring fees. Adjusted EBITDA was $139.5 million, up 21.7% year over year.",
			"As of Mar 31, 2023, Energizer’s cash and cash equivalents were $193.7 million, with long-term debt of $3,414.6 million and shareholders' equity of $148.4 million. In the first half of fiscal 2023, ENR paid more than $158.2 million of debt, reducing its leverage by 1/2 turn year over year. In the reported quarter, it paid out a dividend of nearly $22 million.<br/><br/>The operating cash flow for the first half of 2023 was $210.2 million and the free cash flow was $192.2 million.",
			"We note that Project Momentum is on track, delivering savings of about $20 million in the first half of fiscal 2023. It anticipates generating overall project savings of $30-$40 million for the year. The one-time project expenses for the current fiscal year are likely to be $25-$35 million and capital expenditure is expected to be $15-$20 million. The company is on track to generate total savings and one-time expenses over the life of the program.<br/><br/>Management reaffirmed its guidance for fiscal 2023. Energizer projects organic revenues to grow in low-single digits for the current fiscal year. The company anticipates a low-single-digit decline for reported revenues. It expects currency headwinds on pre-tax earnings of $20 million and 22 cents per share, based on the current rates.<br/><br/>Adjusted EBITDA is forecast to be $585-$615 million.

			"Monster Beverage (MNST) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.",
			"The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.",
			"Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.",
			"Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Monster Beverage basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.",
			"<b>Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices</b>",
			"The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.",

			"Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.",

			"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.",
			"Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.",
			"Below, we take a look at <b>Monster Beverage (MNST)</b>, a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.",
			"It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Monster Beverage currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.",
			"You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;",
			"<b>Set to Beat the Market?</b>",
			"Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for MNST that show why this energy drink maker shows promise as a solid momentum pick.",
			"Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.",
			"For MNST, shares are up 5.52% over the past week while the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry is flat over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 13.6% compares favorably with the industry's 1.53% performance as well.",
			"Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Monster Beverage have increased 16.17% over the past quarter, and have gained 37.79% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 0.39% and 1.3%, respectively.",
			"Investors should also pay attention to MNST's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. MNST is currently averaging 3,909,463 shares for the last 20 days.",
			"<b>Earnings Outlook</b>",
			"The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with MNST.",
			"Over the past two months, 4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost MNST's consensus estimate, increasing from $1.49 to $1.50 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period.",
			"<b>Bottom Line</b>",
			"Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that MNST is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Monster Beverage on your short list.",

			"Electronic commerce, or e-commerce, has been a major part of the global economy for several years now. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted just how much utility can be found in this sector by offering consumers across the globe the option of shopping for essential goods at a time when one couldn't even leave their home.",
			"The e-commerce market is one that has grown exponentially for years, and this growth is expected to continue well into the next decade.

This growth is expected even after the pandemic has ended since consumer behavior has been shaped at this point to prefer seamless and frictionless shopping experiences that are hassle-free and time-saving.",
			"According to a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:survey;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/consumer-markets/consumer-insights-survey.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> conducted by professionals at PwC in December, 43% of global consumers are planning to increase their online shopping in the following six months. The survey also showed the interest of many consumers in next-generation digital platforms such as the metaverse. About 26% of the respondents in this survey noted that they had participated in metaverse-related activities in the six months leading up to December, for instance.",
			"While e-commerce has been growing, in-store shopping managed to retain its position as the most popular mode of shopping, according to the survey. About 43% of the respondents picked in-store shopping as their mode of shopping in December. However, shopping online through mobile phones was the second-most popular option, with 34% of the respondents picking this mode. The third and fourth-most popular modes were also online, through personal computers or tablets (23% and 15%, respectively). This shows that online shopping is managing to retain its popularity even in a post-COVID world.",

			"If you’re looking for the most efficient shopping trip, try shopping in the morning on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. Not only will you avoid the crowds, but you’ll also have a better selection of fresh products, as the warehouses are restocked overnight. Plus, shopping in the morning allows you to beat the afternoon rush, ensuring that you’ll have plenty of time to check out and get on with your day. If you can’t do the mornings, evenings near closing time are also a good option.",
			"If you’re not sure which day is best to shop at your local Costco, one of the best ways to find out is by checking <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Google’s live traffic map;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1WUGwFZsIutO-8eOKDMxmJ6D4QOI&amp;hl=en_US&amp;ll=35.137878938941405%2C-92.41699249999999&amp;z=4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google’s live traffic map</a>. This tool provides real-time data on traffic conditions in your area, including how busy stores like Costco are at any given time. By checking the map before you head out to the store, you can get an idea of when the store is likely to be busiest and adjust your schedule accordingly.",
			"Another way to find out the best time to shop at Costco in your area is to simply ask the employees at the store. They’re likely to have a good sense of when the store is busiest and when it’s quieter. If you’re a regular shopper at the store, you can also keep track of the crowds and trends yourself over time. This can help you develop a sense of when the store is likely to be busy and when it’s not.",
			"Another factor to consider is the time of year. Certain times of year, such as holidays and special events, can be busier at Costco. For example, during the weeks leading up to Christmas, Costco stores tend to be much busier than usual. If you can, try to do your shopping outside of peak holiday periods to avoid the crowds.",
			"Perhaps most importantly, it’s a great idea to go into Costco knowing exactly what you want to maximize your shopping experience and minimize your time spent in the store. Costco stores are massive, and it can be easy to get lost or overwhelmed if you don’t know what you’re looking for. Make a list of the items you need and stick to it. Avoid browsing or impulse purchases, as this can lead to spending more money than you intended.",
			"While these are general trends in terms of the best and worst days to shop at Costco, just know that where Costco is involved, it’s best to keep an open mind. By being mindful of the crowds and planning your trip accordingly, you can have a stress-free shopping experience at this popular warehouse store.",

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $948.5 million, indicating an increase of 14.1% from the prior-year reported figure.<br/><br/>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at 23 cents. The consensus estimate has been stable over the past 30 days.<br/><br/>We expect Grocery Outlet to generate revenues of $941 million, suggesting an increase of 13.2% year over year, and post earnings of 22 cents a share.<br/><br/>Grocery Outlet, the extreme value retailer of quality, name-brand consumables and fresh products, has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 11.9%, on average. In the last reported quarter, this Emeryville, CA-based company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a margin of 8.7%.",
			"Grocery Outlet’s flexible sourcing and distribution business model, which helps it offer products at an exceptional value, and excellent service from independent operators are among the key factors driving revenues.<br/><br/>The company’s opportunistic purchasing strategy, marketing efforts, store-growth endeavors and e-commerce initiatives to deepen the customer reach also appear encouraging.

Management projected a gross margin of approximately 30.6% for the first quarter compared with the 30.2% reported in the year-ago period.<br/><br/>While the aforementioned factors raise optimism, we cannot ignore the margins. Any deleverage in SG&amp;A expenses due to higher store-related expenses and store occupancy costs may weigh on margins.",

			"A recent conversation between <em>Fortune’</em>s Phil Wahba and PepsiCo’s CHRO Ronald Schellekens caught my attention. Schellekens shared that PepsiCo has never—and as far as he’s concerned, will never—waver on its unique commitment to hiring 2,000 U.S. graduates each year. Cut to my immediate reaction: <em>In this economy? </em>",
			"The conversation, part of an exclusive <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Fortune Connect panel;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2023/04/04/pepsi-talent-academy-treats-workers-like-corporate-assets-ronald-schelleken/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune Connect panel</a>, detailed how the food and beverage juggernaut stays true to its “people as assets” approach. “Many companies invest in management and leadership training, but few do it as systematically as PepsiCo,” wrote Phil in his December <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:feature;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/pepsico-executive-leadership-training-fortune-500-ceos/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">feature</a> detailing the food and beverage giant's leadership development strategy.",
			"Though hiring 2,000 graduates annually is not a formalized commitment in writing, Schellekens says it's necessary for building a robust talent pipeline. “That requires, I think, a kind of institutionalized culture where we say, 'Okay, this is the belief of the company. This is how we build leaders for the future.'”",
			"Many of today's Fortune 500 CEOs had career pit stops at PepsiCo. There's Brian Cornell at Target, Lauren Hobart at Dick’s Sporting Goods, and Dave Kimbell at Ulta Beauty, to name a few. In total, 16 current Fortune 500 CEOs have previously worked at PepsiCo.",
			"“Our early hiring programs are vital to this effort of building a pipeline, and we’re proud that we’ve been tracking roughly the same number over at least the past two recruitment cycles,” shared a spokesperson for PepsiCo. “This is purely based on hiring needs and the belief in our college [and] university hiring programs.”",
			"PepsiCo's approach to internal career growth has earned it the reputation of a \"talent academy,\" and it's always assessing workers' potential, Schellekens says. “We don’t like it when people leave our company and become CHRO or CEO of another company, but they always leave us for much bigger jobs...They always make a big jump.”",

			"Ramhold noted that Costco sells a wide variety of meat and seafood — most of which is high-quality and offers an absolutely unbeatable value.",
			"“Whether you want pre-made burger patties, ground beef, Italian sausage, chicken thighs or a myriad of other types and cuts, [Costco’s] likely going to have you covered,” Ramhold shared. “You can even order high-end products like Wagyu beef online, and find an array of pork and lamb in select stores as well. The unit prices are always way better than what a standard grocery store sells and honestly, the quality is superior in my opinion; everything I’ve tried from Costco has been great, whereas the meats I’ve found at grocery stores can be hit or miss.”",
			"This cookware is a hybrid of stainless steel and cast iron — plus, it’s nonstick. It’s oven-safe, dishwasher-safe, free of nontoxic coatings and has a lifetime warranty. As a bonus, it’s Gordan Ramsay-approved. The famous chef dubbed HexClad the “Rolls Royce of pans.”",
			"While the pans are a high-quality item worth the investment, you can get the most bang for your buck when Costco runs a special event. For example, in May, the warehouse giant has a HexClad seven-piece cookware set for $349.99, which includes an 8-inch, 10-inch and 12-inch HexClad Saute Pan with separate lids and a 12-inch HexClad Stir Fry Wok. Amazon sells a six-piece set minus the 12-inch HexClad Stir Fry Wok for $50 more or $399.99.",

It comes in either blue or gray with an upholstered platform bed and headboard. The best part is that you don’t need a box spring. Instead, you can place your mattress directly on the platform’s wooden slats, which have non-slip tape on them to keep your mattress from moving.",

Yet, the regional banking crisis deepened throughout the week, raising hopes that the central bank might take a more pragmatic view of the situation.

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.",
			"We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Simply Wall St analysis model;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://github.com/SimplyWallSt/Company-Analysis-Model/blob/master/MODEL.markdown#discounted-cash-flow-dcf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Simply Wall St analysis model</a>.",

			"We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.",
			"Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:",
			"<i>(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)</i><br/><strong>Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF)</strong> = US$27b",
			"After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.",
			"<strong>Terminal Value (TV)</strong>= FCF<sub>2032</sub> × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.8b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$104b",
			"<strong>Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)</strong>= TV / (1 + r)<sup>10</sup>= US$104b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)<sup>10</sup>= US$53b",
			"The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$80b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$33.2, the company appears quite undervalued at a 42% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.",
			"The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Keurig Dr Pepper as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.",
			"<strong>Strength</strong>",
			"<strong>Weakness</strong>",
			"<strong>Opportunity</strong>",
			"<strong>Threat</strong>",
			"Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Keurig Dr Pepper, we've put together three essential factors you should further research:",

			"Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Target Corporation (<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:NYSE:TGT;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nyse-tgt/target?blueprint=2499722&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=intro&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NYSE:TGT</a>).",
			"Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.",

			"<strong>ROE can be calculated by using the formula:</strong>",
			"Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity",
			"So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Target is:",
			"25% = US$2.8b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).",
			"The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.25 in profit.",
			"By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Target has a better ROE than the average (11%) in the <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Consumer Retailing industry;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/us/consumer-staples/food-staples-retail?blueprint=2499722&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=industry&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Consumer Retailing industry</a>.",
			"That's what we like to see. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Our risks dashboard;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-retailing/nyse-tgt/target?blueprint=2499722&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=conclusion&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Our risks dashboard</a>should have the 5 risks we have identified for Target.",
			"Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.",
			"It's worth noting the high use of debt by Target, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.26. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.",
			"Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.",
			"Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock.

			"A big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. The last payment made up 80% of earnings, but cash flows were much higher. In general, cash flows are more important than earnings, so we are comfortable that the dividend will be sustainable going forward, especially with so much cash left over for reinvestment.",
			"Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 28.2%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 65%, which would make us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend, despite the levels currently being quite high.",
			"The company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $2.96, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $4.72. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 4.8% per annum over that time. Slow and steady dividend growth might not sound that exciting, but dividends have been stable for ten years, which we think makes this a fairly attractive offer.",
			"Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. However, Kimberly-Clark has only grown its earnings per share at 2.7% per annum over the past five years. Slow growth and a high payout ratio could mean that Kimberly-Clark has maxed out the amount that it has been able to pay to shareholders. When the rate of return on reinvestment opportunities falls below a certain minimum level, companies often elect to pay a larger dividend instead. This is why many mature companies often have larger dividend yields.",
			"Overall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Kimberly-Clark will make a great income stock. The company is generating plenty of cash, but we still think the dividend is a bit high for comfort. We don't think Kimberly-Clark is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.",

			"Impressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Before this announcement, British American Tobacco was paying out 74% of earnings, but a comparatively small 53% of free cash flows. Since the dividend is just paying out cash to shareholders, we care more about the cash payout ratio from which we can see plenty is being left over for reinvestment in the business.",
			"Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 44.0%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 56% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.",
			"The company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was £1.35, compared to the most recent full-year payment of £2.31. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 5.5% over that duration. We like to see dividends have grown at a reasonable rate, but with at least one substantial cut in the payments, we're not certain this dividend stock would be ideal for someone intending to live on the income.",
			"With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. British American Tobacco's EPS has fallen by approximately 31% per year during the past five years. Such rapid declines definitely have the potential to constrain dividend payments if the trend continues into the future. Over the next year, however, earnings are actually predicted to rise, but we would still be cautious until a track record of earnings growth can be built.",
			"Overall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think British American Tobacco will make a great income stock. The company is generating plenty of cash, which could maintain the dividend for a while, but the track record hasn't been great. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.",
			"It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one.

			"The U.S. labor market has been at the center of debate for the past couple of months. This is due to the economic overheating in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic and the Federal Reserve's efforts to fight the aftermath. While economic growth is generally viewed positively, too much growth is also a bad thing since it leaves excessive cash flowing in the market which then results in inflation. So, during macroeconomic growth, firms see their businesses boom and end up hiring more people. This creates a scarcity in the labor market, and to compete for employees, the pay offered to them rises. This, in turn, leaves more disposable income for spending, which then ends up increasing the demand for goods, products, and services. This higher demand ends up straining manufacturing capacity, causing firms to raise their production costs and then by extension, prices.",

They are concentrated primarily in the retail trade and leisure and hospitality industry. Within the retail sector, out of the total 16 million people employed, this age group accounts for 1.3 million or nearly ten percent of the workforce. In the retail sector, the workers are employed primarily in warehouses, supercenters, general stores, and supermarkets (such as those operated by Walmart Inc. (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:WMT;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/walmart+inc/104169/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WMT</a>)). In the leisure and hospitality industry, teenagers account for a greater proportion of the workforce. According to the data, after employees aged between 25 and 34 years (2.9 million), the teenage group was the largest constituent of this industry since out of the total 13.7 million people employed, 2.3 million were 16 to 19 year olds. Within the hospitality sector, fast food restaurants (such as those operated by McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:MCD;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/mcdonalds%20corp/63908/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MCD</a>)) were by far the largest employers of teenagers, as they employed 1.9 million out of the total 2.3 million.",
			"Naturally, since these two industries are the largest employers for teenagers, it's relevant to take a look at what the future might hold for them. The Labor Department classifies Fast Food and Counter workers as part of the broader Food and Beverage Serving and Related Workers segment. According to its statistics, there were <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:4.1 million people employed;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/food-preparation-and-serving/food-and-beverage-serving-and-related-workers.htm#tab-1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">4.1 million people employed</a> in this category as of 2021. Apart from fast food counter workers, who take orders and deal with customers, other roles in this segment include waiters and servers. The <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:median hourly wage;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/food-preparation-and-serving/food-and-beverage-serving-and-related-workers.htm#tab-5\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">median hourly wage</a> for this category was $12.49 in 2021, with Fast Food and Counter workers making slightly lesser $12.07 per hour. Within the broader category, the top ten percent made more than $16.40 per hour while the bottom ten percent made less than $8.80. The Labor Department further estimates that jobs in the food and beverage serving and related roles will <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:grow at 9%;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/food-preparation-and-serving/food-and-beverage-serving-and-related-workers.htm#tab-6\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">grow at 9%</a> between 2021 and 2031 - which is faster than the 5% growth for all jobs in the U.S. as a whole.",

Estimates show that from employing 15.3 million people in 2021, the Retail trade industry will see employees leave with the total number of workers estimated to sit at <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:15 million;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/employment-by-major-industry-sector.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">15 million</a> by 2031 end. In percentage terms, this represents a 0.2% drop in compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) terms until 2031. This is in opposition to the 0.5% growth that was recorded during the ten years between 2011 and 2021.",
			"As a whole, non-farm employment in America remained strong during March 2023. A total of 236,000 new jobs were added, with the unemployment rate sitting at a flat 3.5%. The new job addition was also driven by the leisure and hospitality industry, which added the highest amount of jobs, or <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:72,000 jobs;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">72,000 jobs</a> out of the total 236,000 additions. However, the market is slowing down, as the latest additions were lower than the six month average of 95,000 new jobs. Within this industry, the food services and bars segment was the largest contributor, as it accounted for 50,000 of the total 72,000 new additions.",
			"Since the leisure and hospitality industry is both a significant employer of teenagers and a strong contributor to overall employment in America, it's also important to take a broad look at the industry's economic prospects.

			"Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of General Mills, Inc. (<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:NYSE:GIS;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-gis/general-mills?blueprint=2498769&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=intro&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NYSE:GIS</a>) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.",
			"Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Simply Wall St analysis model here;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://github.com/SimplyWallSt/Company-Analysis-Model/blob/master/MODEL.markdown#discounted-cash-flow-dcf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Simply Wall St analysis model here</a> may be something of interest to you.",

			"We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.",
			"A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:",
			"<i>(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)</i><br/><strong>Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF)</strong> = US$22b",
			"The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.",
			"<strong>Terminal Value (TV)</strong>= FCF<sub>2032</sub> × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.8b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$81b",
			"<strong>Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)</strong>= TV / (1 + r)<sup>10</sup>= US$81b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)<sup>10</sup>= US$42b",
			"The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$64b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$89.8, the company appears about fair value at a 17% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.",
			"The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at General Mills as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.",
			"<strong>Strength</strong>",
			"<strong>Weakness</strong>",
			"<strong>Opportunity</strong>",
			"<strong>Threat</strong>",
			"Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For General Mills, there are three additional aspects you should assess:",

			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Welcome to Yahoo Finance's special coverage of the 2023 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting, known as the Woodstock of capitalism. And it's among the biggest events of the year for investors. We'll hear from legendary investor and Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett, along with his Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, as they give us their unique take on what's been a complicated year for the markets.",
			"A banking crisis, a slowing economy, geopolitical tensions, accelerated digital transformation with AI and a lot more, it's all on the agenda today. We're breaking down the big news from today's meeting and what's happening to the markets and your money.",
			"Brian Sozzi of Yahoo Finance here with Yahoo Finance's head of news, Myles Udland. And Myles and I, along with all of these people, are streaming out of the CHI Health Center in Omaha, Nebraska, have been ingesting hours and hours of Warren Buffett's insights into the economy and stocks alongside his right-hand man, Vice Chair Charlie Munger. And of course, we have a lot of takeaways.",
			"But let's start with three from this really celebration of capitalism, as those Berkshire shareholders love to call it. First off, the big banks, everybody in this room was waiting, Myles, to hear from Buffett on his views on the banks. Of course, First Republic now owned by JP Morgan, Buffett really not disappointing. Out of all the bank stocks that he talked about and the sector itself, he said he liked Bank of America, which he owns 13% of.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, well, so he came through his prepared remarks, which he said will be brief. They ran about 18 minutes, which I guess for Buffett--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> That's brief.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> --counts as brief. And we kind of got right into it with the regional banks. And really the question was, what would have happened had the deposits of Silicon Valley Bank not been insured, and ultimately Buffett going with what I think most people would have expected him to say, where he said it would have been catastrophic.",
			"And I think, you know, Sozzi, it brings me back to that weekend where the bank is seized by regulators Friday morning. And everyone's thinking what's going to happen over the weekend. Ultimately FDIC comes out. They say we're going to backstop these.",
			"And throughout the proceedings there were a couple of questions in this direction. And I think Buffett's takeaway is that effectively all deposits in the US are now backstopped.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> That's good.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Whether they say that or not.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> That's good. And that, of course, as well, Myles, as well, but come Monday morning's open for the market--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> I didn't get the sense that Buffett signaled to the world, go out and buy bank stocks. He sounded like many other people are, yeah, they might do this. They might do that. But I didn't hear that same tone compared to what I heard from Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, a couple of days at Milken, where she said things are stable. I just didn't get that vibe.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, I mean, we'll get to it in a little bit with his comments on Bank of America in more detail. But he did say that if you are an investor in banks right now or a prospective investor, I think he said, if you're a bank shareholder to use his phrase exactly, kind of hard to know what you buy, or what you're owning I guess in that situation. And a lot of it for him has to go with what are deposits.",
			"And he mentioned how sticky are deposits now, because did the whole wind-up. You don't have to stand in line to take him out of a bank. You can just go on your phone and pull your money. Obviously a dynamic that we saw with the Fed's report and the FDIC's report a couple of weeks ago is what happened at Silicon Valley Bank.",
			"What has been happening in the sector is people are wondering who is next. But really I think from Buffett's view, there's just a perception right now that you do not know for sure for sure what the business of a bank exactly looks like.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> And, you know, you mentioned Bank of America, Myles, and you're a student of Warren Buffett and this meeting, been coming to it for many years. I can't say I'm surprised that he called out Bank of America. Of course he owns 13% of it. But under CEO Brian Moynihan, they aren't necessarily out there taking these crazy risks that a lot of these other regional banks are. So a different company, but again, Buffett, being Buffett, suggesting that Bank of America is doing something right in this climate.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, and ultimately I think his takeaway was, well, I bought the thing back in 2011. He puts a bunch of capital in it. And I guess I'm going to see that through 12 years later.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Yep, absolutely. All right, well, outside the bank, of course, another takeaway we have is AI. So everybody was focused on what Buffett and Munger had to say on banks, but also artificial intelligence. And again, I'm going back. I'm thinking through the stock action on Monday. I just don't think these AI stocks, which have been really hot, come out blasting off of what Warren Buffett said out of the gate here.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> I mean sure, if you're trying to play the AI stocks--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> I'm trying to, I'm trying.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Based on what Warren Buffett is going to do, I mean, I don't really know if I can help you with that. But I think that the AI interaction there, and that was, I think, question two, three, four. It was right up there on the proceedings. It really got us our first great Mungerism of the day, when you're talking about what's the power of AI, this, that, and the other. And of course Charlie hits us with, well, I think old fashioned intelligence works just fine. We don't need the artificial stuff.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> There's nothing wrong with that.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> The good old fashioned intelligence is just fine in his view.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> But it is interesting that they view AI, they first went to BYD robots. Of course BYD is that electric car company. That's their first interpretation of what AI is, not Microsoft.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Buffett and that Bill Gates relationship, not what they're doing, robots making cars.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> And I think that the reason that people come to this event, and the reason that Warren and Charlie have an audience, is because they are representative in a lot of ways of the median investor's view on this. And sure, you talked a lot of people who get really excited about language learning models and all these kinds of AGI, right? It's not just AI. It's artificial general intelligence.",
			"And they're just like, I mean, we have robots, you know. Robots are fine. And also in this section, too, I think it's the first time of many times where we got to what if he references to nuclear weapons.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Yes.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> And the technology--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Which he always does, which he does in the past.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Is a regular feature of these. But I think that the risk of-- like the nuclear risk to Buffett is sort of the go to zero risk. And obviously in the '60s, very formative time in his career, and it's something that he brings up quite a bit.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> So bottom line with that takeaway, folks, is if you were looking for Warren Buffett to pitch shares of C3AI, not going to happen. Next take away, of course, value investing. That's why a lot of people that I've talked to at this event, that's why they come here, to get a sense of what Warren Buffett sees in terms of value. And it was interesting what he said on value investing, Myles.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, and, you know, I think this is where we saw the biggest distance between Warren and Charlie. Charlie Munger, very pessimistic on it, he said, I just think it's going to be worse in the future. And Buffett coming back and saying, well, you know, Charlie, you always say that.",
			"And I think that to use Munger's exact quote, my advice to value investors is get used to making less money. And you see the folks kind of behind us here certainly this morning teeming into the building, you know, people in sport coats and khakis, value types. I overheard quite a few conversations on my way in to that effect.",
			"And they weren't just trying to give some encouragement to the crowd. And this is where we kind of got to a Warren zinger, perhaps, where your biggest opportunity as an investor, value or otherwise, is other people doing dumb things.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Yeah, a lot of folks mistaking me for a hedge fund manager at this event. I also point out--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Well, you're dressed like one.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> I know.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> I'm dressed like a normal person. You're dressed like a hedge fund manager.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> I know. Well, I also, on value investing, I caught up with Whitney Tilson, longtime Buffett follower and friend of our shows. He said based on his models, he said this after the event, he calculates that Berkshire is trading at a 13% discount to intrinsic value. So if value investing is really dead, what do you do with Berkshire stock if it is that undervalued?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, well, what did Warren say? $504 billion on a GAAP basis is what the stock is worth? And you kind of, or I think it's $504,000 per share. You do the quick and dirty math on that, divided by the 1,500, you get 333 for B shares, and I think they closed around 320 on Friday.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> All right.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> So, I mean, Whitney always-- I've been in many presentations at this event with Whitney telling me that I should be buying Berkshire Hathaway. So I don't think you're going to get a different answer from him at other points in time.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Fair enough. All right, of course, we have a rapid-fire section for you as well, hitting a lot of these favorite Yahoo Finance tickers. First off Apple, of course, Apple is a key holder, a key holding inside of Berkshire Hathaway. And Myles, naturally, it took a little while to get that Apple question. But it was interesting how it was posed to him.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> It did, and we kind of got to it in two ways. I think what'll draw the headlines is Buffett saying, you know, I don't understand the product at all, or I don't understand the phone. But I understand the business. He understands the business of selling phones, not necessarily how one makes a phone.",
			"But that also got into really what I think Apple has become the most instructive holding within Berkshire's portfolio. They pay a huge dividend. So every quarter, they're getting hundreds of millions-- they're getting $100 million check, or it's not, it's much larger than that. But nine figure check coming to Berkshire Hathaway.",
			"Second thing, they buy back a lot of stock. So Berkshire's holdings in Apple, its percentage of the company that it owns, has gone up organically over time. We saw the announcement on Thursday night from Apple increasing the size of that buyback authorization.",
			"So it's going to continue to go up. And it led to this discussion of how much Apple do you really own. And you look at the equity portfolio, it's out 40%. And Buffett was like, it's not 40%. We own a bunch of other stuff, See's Candies, Garanimals, got tons of runs in a kid's clothing brand. Tons of run today. But basically being like we're not 35% Apple, because our equity holdings are only a small chunk of the whole Berkshire family.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> You look at Apple and you have to think, is this the new Coca-Cola for this generation in terms of an investment for Warren Buffett. Is this Warren Buffett connecting with that next generation of investors?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> I mean, I think, look, you can kind of say, and Buffett would probably say this, doesn't really matter what the product is. They have a dominant position in the market. They make a ton of money. They return a bunch of that money to shareholders.",
			"So whether you're selling Coca-Cola or you're selling iPhones, it hits all those criteria. And whatever generation you want to call any company, any company coming from, Buffett's going to like those characteristics.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Next up rapid-fire session here, Paramount. Of course, on Friday the stock got absolutely slaughtered, slashing its dividend, bad quarter, lots of losses. And one thing that stuck with me from that quarter from Paramount, Myles, when I talked to Amex's CEO, Stephen Squeri, that story is on our homepage now. He says do not surprise Warren Buffett.",
			"To me he sounded surprised this event. He did not come out and say, you know, Bob Bakish is a phenomenal manager. Of course that's the CEO of Paramount. He didn't do it. He didn't do it.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Well, we just talked about how Warren Buffett likes companies that return a lot of capital to shareholders. What did Paramount come out and do on Thursday? They cut their dividend. And Buffett says never good when a company announces a material cut to their dividend.",
			"You're trying to shore up your capital position. You can't give it back to your owners basically. So I'll be interested to see what happens with that position. It kind of is a small part of the Berkshire equity portfolio, kind of came up-- I won't say out of nowhere, he has a long history investing in the media business, but all of a sudden it's a bunch of Paramount. Now he owns 93 million shares of the company.",
			"And so we get into the conversation about the streaming wars. And I thought his comments on your eyeballs were quite hilarious.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Yeah, eyeballs matter, but in that--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> He goes everyone loves to use their eyes.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> No, yes, and that's key, he's clearly bullish eyes. But in that context, there's a lot of competition for our eyeballs, which is why I think that stake in Paramount disclosed in November last year raised a lot of eyebrows, because it wasn't really Warren Buffetty.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> I think everyone thinks the same thing, and, you know, look, the 13F will come out, I guess what, middle of next week, what they did or didn't do in the first quarter. So I think some questions there with that position.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> We're keeping it moving here, Taiwan Semiconductor, a position that Buffett took, what was it, late last year. And then he exited very quickly, not a very Warren Buffett type of move. But he did heap a lot of praise on that company.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, I mean, I'll kick this one right back to you, because you wrote up a quick story for us on this one. He heaped a lot of praise on it. And he kind of had a weird-- I don't know, I couldn't make sense of exactly what the point was on not wanting exposure to Taiwan, but saying US-China relations might be fine. Everyone has blame. I couldn't quite sort that one out.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Yeah, and if you're an Intel and you're a lot of these other chip-makers, to not hear Warren Buffett say you're doing cool stuff, not exactly a great thing. Lastly, Occidental Petroleum. Of course, a lot of investors, Warren Buffett built its position or his position in Occidental Petroleum under the potential, maybe goes out and just buys the darn company. But Warren said, eh-eh, unlikely to happen.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> He was very blunt. We are not going to make a play to take control of the company. They have approval to buy up to 50% of the outstanding shares. I think they own about 25% today. But, yeah, there was an analyst that talked to our RNS friend Josh Schafer last week who surmised maybe Vicki Hollub, CEO, would come in and run Berkshire Hathaway Energy when Greg Abel moves on. I mean, maybe that could happen.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Ooh, that's good.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Yeah, it was a good one in the story. But Buffett kind of squashing that today.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> And then final takeaways, Myles, to you. You first.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MYLES UDLAND:</span> Really crowded, man, this place is crowded. This place yesterday, extremely stressful going in the Convention Hall.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> For me, two takeaways, one amazing to see Warren Buffett, 92 years old, Charlie Munger 99 years old, answering all these questions in top form. I'm just fascinated by the whole thing. And the next, last but not least, on Monday, the \"Morning Brief\" newsletter, please do check that out, subscribe, whatever. We're looking into the succession battle, or not battle, or succession plan here for Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway. Lots of interesting nuggets that our team pulled here from the event.",
			"But that's it for yours truly and Myles Udland. And we're going to get back and get some air conditioning. It's a little warm here in Omaha, Nebraska. We'll see you guys later."

			"Dividend stocks have been on investors’ radars for quite some time now because of their ability to generate stable and regular income, lower risk, and tax advantages. Companies in the US also registered investors’ inclination toward dividend equities and steadily boosted their payouts over the years. According to a report by <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:McKinsey &amp; Company;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/prime-numbers/share-repurchases-still-dont-prop-up-value\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">McKinsey &amp; Company</a>, US companies returned 78% of their net income on average in dividends and share repurchases between 1995 and 2021, up from 60% on average between 1965 to 2008. This has boosted investors’ confidence, who are increasingly loading up on dividend stocks, especially during periods of market downturns.",
			"High inflationary periods have previously been beneficial for dividend equities because they have the potential to offer higher yields. This is more appealing for investors seeking income that can keep up with inflation. In our article titled <a class=\"link yahoo-link\" data-ylk=\"slk:25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know;elm:context_link;itc:0;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-things-every-dividend-investor-125859319.html\">25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know</a>, we reported that dividends accounted for 54% of the market’s returns during decades of high inflation. The report also mentioned that during the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, dividends represented 67%, 44%, and 73% of the market’s returns, respectively. During these decades, inflation averaged above 5% with total returns averaging below 10%.",
			"When investing in dividend stocks, investors also pay attention to dividend yields as they indicate the amount of income an investor can expect to receive from a dividend-paying stock concerning its price. High dividend-yielding stocks are often considered risky investments because they signal financial distress or underlying problems within a company. However, overall financial health and a solid balance sheet of the respective company can mitigate the risks associated with high yields. Altria Group, Inc.

			"If the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Before making this announcement, Kraft Heinz was paying out quite a large proportion of both earnings and cash flow, with the dividend being 131% of cash flows. Paying out such a high proportion of cash flows certainly exposes the company to cutting the dividend if cash flows were to reduce.",
			"The next year is set to see EPS grow by 62.6%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 46%, which would make us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend, despite the levels currently being quite high.",
			"Kraft Heinz has been paying dividends for a while, but the track record isn't stellar. If the company cuts once, it definitely isn't argument against the possibility of it cutting in the future. Since 2016, the dividend has gone from $2.30 total annually to $1.60. This works out to be a decline of approximately 5.1% per year over that time. Declining dividends isn't generally what we look for as they can indicate that the company is running into some challenges.",
			"Dividends have been going in the wrong direction, so we definitely want to see a different trend in the earnings per share. Kraft Heinz's earnings per share has shrunk at 26% a year over the past five years. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective. Even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this becomes a long term trend.",
			"Overall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. The payments are bit high to be considered sustainable, and the track record isn't the best. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.",

Last year's total dividend payments show that Coca-Cola Europacific Partners has a trailing yield of 2.2% on the current share price of €59.6. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid.

Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It distributed 31% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.",
			"It's positive to see that Coca-Cola Europacific Partners's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.",

Fortunately for readers, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners's earnings per share have been growing at 18% a year for the past five years. Coca-Cola Europacific Partners has an average payout ratio which suggests a balance between growing earnings and rewarding shareholders. Given the quick rate of earnings per share growth and current level of payout, there may be a chance of further dividend increases in the future.",
			"Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, seven years ago, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners has lifted its dividend by approximately 10% a year on average.

			"While investors scrutinize revenue and earnings changes year-over-year and how they compare with Wall Street expectations to determine their next move, some key metrics always offer a more accurate picture of a company's financial health.",

			"Whether you're in need of wrapping paper for a birthday gift, wedding present or Christmas surprise, you can save big by skipping Walmart and heading to the Dollar Store. Walmart charges $8.49 for one roll of a plain-colored wrapping paper. You can pick up a roll for only $1.25 at the Dollar Tree.",
			"Whether you're hosting a graduation party, an anniversary celebration or a baby shower, Walmart might be the first place you consider for party supplies. But if you're also hosting on a budget, you'll do better heading to the nearest dollar store.",
			"\"Party supplies at Walmart can be up to five times the cost of party supplies at dollar stores,\" said Carson Yarbrough, a consumer insights specialist for Offers.com, a site for coupons and insider savings tips. \"If you're planning a party, opt to get party supplies like plastic cups, decorations and balloons at the dollar store to see significant savings.\"",
			"There's nothing more exciting than watching your little one jump for joy when given a new toy, but you don't need to pay more to experience that same reaction. The Thomas &amp; Friends Fix 'em Up Friends Toy Train Set costs $39.99 at Walmart, but you can save on it by buying it at Target for $18.99.",
			"Furniture can be expensive. So, if you're just starting out or looking for inexpensive pieces for your home, you might be lured by Walmart's low prices on wood furniture. Keep in mind, however, that you get what you pay for at these prices.",
			"\"Walmart has relatively cheap wood furniture, but this is because it's a lesser quality than other furniture retailers,\" said Yarbrough. \"Wooden furniture from Walmart is more likely to break or deteriorate quicker, so buy your furniture elsewhere to save money and the hassle of replacing it in two months.\"",
			"Many of us love to give our locks the luxury treatment with salon-quality shampoos and conditioners. However, shampoo is one of the items you should buy on Amazon instead of Walmart.",
			"At Walmart, 33.8 ounces of Nexxus Therappe Moisture Shampoo costs $25.98, but you'll pay $24.72 with free shipping on Amazon. You can use those savings to purchase some new hair ties to replace the ones you're always losing.",
			"Although Walmart offers a decent price of 12 cents per photo print, you can do better. There are several apps that give you the opportunity to order copies of your favorite photos for free. Shutterfly, for example, gets you started with unlimited free prints when you download its app. There's also an app called FreePrints that makes ordering pictures as easy as 1-2-3, and it also provides services free of charge. Customers simply pay for shipping, which still makes the purchase much cheaper than buying prints from Walmart.",
			"Crucial for operating everything from toys to remote controls, batteries are a must-have item around the house. The problem with Walmart, however, is that you'll likely spend a lot on batteries and get little in return.",
			"Right now, the retailer offers a four-pack of Energizer Ultimate AA Lithium Batteries for $14.76. But if you buy in bulk at Sam's Club, you'll get an 18-pack of the batteries for $34.98.",
			"Most people can't get their days started without a cup of joe. Because coffee is relatively inexpensive, you might not question Walmart's prices. But the truth is, competitors like Amazon typically sell the same brands of coffee for less.",
			"For example, Walmart's price for Maxwell House Original Roast Ground Coffee (30.6 ounces) is $10.46, but the coffee is sold at Amazon for $9.36.",
			"Many prospective college students head to Walmart to get items for their dorm rooms. This can include a minifridge for always having a cold drink on hand. Unfortunately, Walmart isn't the best place to get this appliance. Parents can save a significant amount of money by taking a few minutes to shop around. For example, if you purchased the Magic Chef 4.4 cubic feet Refrigerator at Walmart, you'd have to pay $355.59. After a little digging, you'd discover Home Depot sells the same minifridge for $249. That's a savings of over $100.",
			"Vitamin supplements can treat nutritional deficiencies, and some vitamins even improve the outlook for certain health conditions. But the cost of vitamins can add up over time, so it's important to find ways to save money. Rather than purchase vitamins from Walmart, compare prices to see if you can find your selections cheaper on Amazon.",
			"You'll save on Vitafusion MultiVites gummy vitamins, for example, when shopping on Amazon. A pack of two 150-count bottle is listed on Amazon for $21.90, whereas Walmart sells a single bottle for $12.47. You save $1.52 on each bottle buying from Amazon.",
			"You'll also save money by skipping Walmart and purchasing your Keurig K55 Brewer from another retailer. Walmart has this particular Keurig model for $169.96. For a cheaper option, head to Amazon where you'll find the same model for $109.99.",
			"Walmart's gift card center features a generous selection of restaurants and retailers, including Olive Garden, Papa John's, Starbucks and Burger King. Plus, there's the option to buy Visa, MasterCard and American Express gift cards. Walmart is a convenient place to pick up cards, but it isn't the cheapest place.",
			"A cost-saving solution involves buying from discount sites like Raise and Cardpool, which have gift cards for up to 30% and 35% off, respectively.",
			"With a prepaid or pay-as-you-go cellphone plan, you don't have to worry about a contract. And, you only pay for the minutes you use.",
			"Walmart's Straight Talk wireless is an affordable cellular solution, with its $55 monthly unlimited nationwide plan and 4G LTE data. This monthly price might agree with your wallet, it's certainly not the best deal in town. If you buy this same plan through Straight Talk Wireless' website, you can get the first three months at $50 per month when you automatically refill it.",
			"Walmart has a huge selection of kitchenware from drinking glasses to cooking items. But if you're on the hunt for simple, inexpensive kitchen merchandise like coffee mugs, flatware or bowls, there's no need to pay big retailer prices. Dollar stores might have exactly what you're looking for at a cheaper price.",
			"Why pay $5 for a basic coffee mug at Walmart when you can get mugs for $1 each at dollar stores?",
			"Most people want to save money. But just because a company claims to be the cheapest retailer on the block doesn't mean it's true. Even with Walmart coupons, you can potentially save elsewhere. With that being said, do your homework, shop around and compare prices at retailers -- your wallet will thank you.",

According to CordCuttersNews.com, it offers some major benefits, such as original programming, like the award winning “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” and “The Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power,” as well as live “Thursday Night Football” and WNBA games.",
			"Many shows that run on other networks eventually become available on Prime Video, as well, and it allows users to download offline, create multiple viewer profiles, and rent or buy movies and TV shows. You can also stack on and manage other streaming services through your Prime membership, such as HBO Max, Starz and Showtime, though you do pay additionally for each one.",
			"Competitor Netflix has long been a leader in both original and popular streaming content, with such award winning and original shows as “Ozark” and “Beef,” even with recent drops in stock prices. Netflix’s plans start as low as $6.99 per month, with ads, and go up to a premium subscription at $19.99 per month.

			"Most people know that one of the biggest perks of Amazon Prime is free one- and two-day shipping on hundreds of thousands of products, with a great return policy too. As mentioned above, for either $14.99 per month, or $139 per year, you can get an Amazon Prime subscription and save on all kinds of deliveries. Additionally, Amazon Prime offers discounts on its memberships to students, to people with EBT cards, and to people on Medicaid, according to PC Magazine.",
			"Enter the big-box retailer Walmart, which rolled out Walmart+ in 2020. This service is a bit cheaper than Prime at $12.95 per month or $98 per year. With this service, registered members can get free unlimited same-day grocery delivery from their local Walmart (with a $35 minimum order); free pickup of returned items from your home; free shipping on other non-grocery products without a minimum order; fuel savings on over 14,000 locations around the U.S. and the ability to earn Walmart rewards on every purchase.",
			"Both services are great, and both offer a 30 day free-trial period, but it’s a bit like comparing apples to oranges. Amazon has a wider selection of products and doesn’t require a shopper to be local to get discounts. A Walmart+ user will have to do the bulk of all of their shopping and gas purchases at Walmart to make the membership worthwhile, but if that is your primary place of shopping, it could be a great deal.",
			"Ultimately, a Prime membership will save you money on all kinds of shipping (not to mention saving you trips to a physical store). So if you order frequently, it’s definitely worth it.",
			"Audible is Amazon’s audiobook arm, where members get one book credit for $14.95 per month, which is often less than the cost of the book otherwise, and is redeemable for literally anything in the Audible database. Or, for $7.95 per month, listeners get access to a more limited selection of books, plus podcasts, sleep tracks and meditation tracks. Audible also often offers a three-credits discount, bringing the cost down to more like $11-$12 per credit, as well as other sales and discounts periodically throughout the year and offers a 30-day free trial.",
			"Competitor Scribd gives Audible a run for its money, and is available on all the same Apple or Android devices with a 30-day free trial. Scribd’s subscription is $11.99 per month, but rather than giving you only one credit, subscribers have unlimited access to the app’s wide database of books, magazines, podcasts and sheet music. The problem is that many bestsellers will take a while to become available, long after they are up on Audible. So as for which is better, it depends on how you’re using your service — to get the latest and greatest new releases, or to be open to books (as well as magazines and podcasts) of all kinds.",
			"Finally, there’s Libby, a free app that makes audiobooks, podcasts and music available to listeners by connecting them with local libraries through a system called Overdrive. Libraries that have Overdrive can allow library members to access audiobooks for free. But libraries are also only allowed a certain number of licenses for each book, and thus wait times can run long. But you can’t get any better than free!",
			"Ultimately, Audible is not the cheapest or likely the best option among audiobooks out there.",
			"Amazon touts its Kindle Unlimited (KU) plan as a great deal, because you can borrow up to 20 KU titles at a time, plus magazines. Because Kindle is available as a free app, you also don’t need to own a Kindle device, but can access it on any smart device such as a phone, tablet or even by computer.",
			"It sounds like an excellent deal, but according to MakeUseOf, there’s one big catch: None of the books available on KU are published by the big publishing houses. Its millions of titles are mostly self-published books, and a few items of classic literature. There’s nothing wrong with self-publishing, except that many of these books don’t go through the editing or vetting process that traditional publishing requires, meaning that you might find as many duds as you do gems.",
			"MakeUseOf also points out that many self-published books sell for very little already, some as little as 99 cents, thus you’d have to read quite a lot of KU books to make the $9.99 per month fee worth it. This is one area where the service is probably not worth the money, and you’d be better off using either Audible, Scribd or the Overdrive/Libby app through your local library.",

			"Three companies – Apple AAPL, Discover Financial Services DFS, and Costco Wholesale COST – have all recently declared a dividend hike. Below is a chart illustrating the performance of all three year-to-date, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span>",
			"For those with an appetite for income, let’s take a closer look at how each company currently stacks up.",
			"<strong><u>Discover Financial Services</u></strong>",
			"Discover raised its quarterly cash dividend by 17% to $0.70 per share following Q1 results, payable on June 8<sup>th</sup>, 2023. The company posted somewhat-mixed results, exceeding revenue expectations by 2.6% but falling short of the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by a fair margin.",
			"As we can see in the chart below, the company has had little issue increasingly rewarding its shareholders.",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span>",
			"DFS shares aren’t valuation stretched, with the current 6.8X forward earnings multiple sitting nicely beneath the 2022 high of 9.6X and the Zacks Finance sector average. The company presently sports a Style Score of “A” for value.",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span>",
			"And to top it off, the company’s cash-generating abilities are solid; DFS reported free cash flow of $1.7 billion in its latest release, improving modestly from the year-ago quarter.",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span>",
			"<strong><u>Apple</u></strong>",
			"Apple’s quarterly results stole the show after yesterday’s close, with the company delivering a positive 5.6% EPS surprise and reporting revenue nearly 2% above expectations. The company also announced a 4% increase to its quarterly cash dividend, payable on May 18<sup>th</sup>.",
			"The dividend increases from Apple have added up over the years, and this is on top of the unbelievable price return that shares have provided.",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span>",
			"Apple shares are currently a bit expensive, trading at a 27.6X forward earnings multiple, well above the 24.3X five-year median. Still, investors have had little issue forking up the premium for Apple shares, as they’ve quickly become a safe haven in a somewhat-cloudy economic outlook.",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span>",
			"<strong><u>Costco Wholesale</u></strong>",
			"On April 19<sup>th</sup>, Costco revealed that its Board of Directors declared a 13% increase to its quarterly dividend, bringing the quarterly payout to $1.02 per share. Impressively, the company’s payout has increased by more than 11% over the last five years.",
			"The company is forecasted to grow steadily, with earnings forecasted to climb nearly 10% in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 8% in FY24. The projected earnings improvement comes on top of forecasted Y/Y revenue growth of 6.5% in FY23 and 5.5% in FY24.",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span>",
			"Like DFS, Costco’s cash-generating abilities were displayed in its latest quarterly results; free cash flow totaled $2.3 billion, reflecting a sizable jump from the year-ago period.",
			"<br/><span>Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span>",
			"<strong><u>Bottom Line</u></strong>",
			"Dividend increases are a positive announcement that shareholders can receive as it reflects the current state of business and future expectations. After all, if a company is struggling, why would it raise its dividend?",
			"And all three companies above – Apple AAPL, Discover Financial Services DFS, and Costco Wholesale COST – have recently declared a dividend hike.",

			"In a pre-e-reader, pre-Amazon world, browsing books at Borders was an idyllic way to spend an afternoon. The mega-bookstore started out with a single location in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and expanded to hundreds of locations throughout the U.S. during its 40-year run. Borders' focus on size may have been its downfall, however, NPR reported -- the chain continued to emphasize stocking a wide variety of books in-store even as online shopping continued to rise in popularity. The company was no longer profitable after 2006 and closed its doors for good in 2011.",

			"Kodak began with the mission to make photography more accessible to the masses -- and back when physical film was a thing, nothing could beat the excitement of seeing how all of your pictures turned out (or the disappointment about the ones that didn't). But as photography went digital, the company went into decline; it filed for bankruptcy in 2012.",
			"In the years since the filing, Kodak has pivoted its focus from cameras to a number of other products, including cellphones, tablets, a digital currency called KodakCoin and commercial printing software. Its latest pivot is even more unexpected -- in August, Kodak agreed to a deal for a $765 million government loan to produce ingredients used to make generic drugs, The Wall Street Journal reported.",
			"If you grew up in the '90s, you likely spent many a Friday night searching for the perfect movie at your local Blockbuster. The first Blockbuster video-rental store opened in Dallas in 1985, a time when most video stores offered just a limited selection of titles. With 8,000 tapes to choose from, Blockbuster quickly became a success and the company expanded rapidly. It eventually became one of the biggest in-home entertainment companies in the world, according to History. Then, digital video came into the picture, and Blockbuster struggled to compete, eventually closing its stores for good in 2013 following its acquisition by Dish in 2011, The New York Times reported. However, this decision did not affect locations that are independently owned. Although most franchises have since closed their stores, one location still remains in Bend, Oregon -- and it may be worth the trip to get your nostalgia fix. Just don't forget to rewind.",
			"Sports Authority was founded in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1987 and grew to become the largest sporting goods store chain in the country with stores in 41 states and Puerto Rico, The Chicago Tribune reported. In 1990 it was acquired by Kmart, and in 2006, the company was bought by a private equity firm. Facing tough competition from Dick's Sporting Goods and Amazon, Sports Authority filed for bankruptcy in 2016. The company hoped to be able to keep some stores open, but after failing to secure a buyer, it closed its doors for good.",
			"The first RadioShack dates back to 1921 with a ham radio shop in Boston, according to the trade magazine Twice. Through the years, it evolved into the go-to spot for loudspeakers, mobile phones, satellite TVs, batteries and electronic toys, and it was the first retailer to sell a mass-marketed, fully-assembled PC. But with the rise of Best Buy and Amazon, RadioShack was soon left in the dust. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2015, was acquired by Sprint, and filed for bankruptcy again in 2017. Following its second bankruptcy, RadioShack started a new partnership with Hobby Lobby to bring RadioShack Express \"stores\" inside 100 HobbyTown locations, CNBC reported.",

			"A popular purveyor of rhinestone logo T-shirts and sweatpants, Bebe was a mall staple for many years. The women's retail store was founded by Iranian-born immigrant Manny Mashouf in 1976, who took the company public in 1998. He and his family were briefly billionaires in 2006 at the peak of the company's success, Forbes reported. But following years of declining sales and losses, Bebe decided to close all of its stores in 2017. The brand has since transitioned to an online-only retailer.",
			"Once lauded for its super-soft, somewhat-overpriced T-shirts and hoodies, American Apparel eventually got swept up in scandals involving its labor practices and allegations of sexual harassment, leading to its downfall. But before all that, the retailer began out of founder Dov Charney's dorm room in 1989. American Apparel went on to expand to over 200 stores in over 20 countries, reaching $633 million in sales, The Atlantic reported. But the scandals, Charney's ousting for those scandals and a changing retail landscape all added up to American Apparel's demise. It declared bankruptcy in 2015 and again in 2016, and was acquired by Canadian company Gildan Activewear in 2017, CNBC reported. While you can no longer browse identical basics in every color of the rainbow at an American Apparel store, you can still purchase the brand online.",
			"Toys R Us started as a baby goods store in 1948 and evolved into the first-ever big-box toy store in 1957. Originally created as a \"supermarket for toys,\" this new model transformed toy shopping from a once-a-year holiday treat to a regular family outing. The idea quickly caught on, and Toys R Us ended up going public in 1978. Business boomed in the '80s and '90s, but, ironically, Toys R Us was defeated by the big-box model it had pioneered, with stores like Walmart proving to be a tough competitor in the space. The rise of e-commerce and Amazon further hurt Toys R Us' bottom line, and the company eventually decided to close all of its U.S. stores in 2018 after declaring bankruptcy, CNN reported.",
			"In 2019, much to the delight of anyone who once considered themselves a Toys R Us kid, the beloved toy chain reemerged -- but on a much smaller scale. It now operates two mall stores: one in Houston and one in Paramus, New Jersey.",
			"Payless ShoeSource was once the go-to shopping destination for inexpensive footwear -- by 2011, its sales volume had reached $3.4 billion, Forbes reported. The shoe retailer started from humble beginnings, with a single store called Volume Shoe Corp. It was incorporated as a part of The May Department stores in 1979 and became its own independent company once again in 1996. Roughly two decades later, Payless filed for bankruptcy in 2017 following increasing debts from an overly aggressive expansion plan. In 2019, Payless filed for bankruptcy a second time and closed all of its stores.",
			"According to Forbes, \"the company continued to encounter too many aggressive competitors, including Zappos (a division of Amazon), Kohl's, Walmart, Target and others who provided more compelling merchandise offerings. A visit to a Payless store became irrelevant.\"",
			"However, Payless reopened under new management in August 2020, and has since opened its first re-designed brick-and-mortar store in Miami.",

In 2010, the company was bought by Bain Capital for $1.8 billion; at the time, Gymboree was rapidly expanding and carried almost no debt. Sadly, things took a turn for the worse and the company filed for bankruptcy in 2017 and again in 2019. Following its second bankruptcy filing, Gymboree was acquired by its competitor, The Children's Place, CNBC reported.",

			"\"This decision was difficult, but necessary, as the Dressbarn chain has not been operating at an acceptable level of profitability in today's retail environment,\" Steven Taylor, chief financial officer of Dressbarn, said in a statement at the time.",

			"When a drug store greeting card just wouldn't do, Papyrus was <em>the</em> destination for upscale greeting cards. But the mall staple's fancy greeting card reign came to an end in 2020 when it filed for bankruptcy and announced that it would be closing all of its stores.",
			"Papyrus dates back to 1950 when it sold cards and imported stationery wholesale, and it expanded into retail stores in 1973. It eventually grew to 500 stores, including its American Greetings, Carlton Cards and Paper Destiny brands, CNN reported. The company never fully recovered from the 2008 financial crisis due to overexpansion and a decline in brick-and-mortar shopping. Although Papyrus stores are closed, you can still shop Papyrus-branded cards at other stores.",
			"Pier 1 Imports began as a single store in San Mateo, California, in 1962, and in 1979, its Royal Oak, Michigan, location became the first to reach $1 million in annual sales. Pier 1 launched its online e-commerce site in 2012 -- but it seems like this move was too little too late. In June 2020, Pier 1 officially went out of business and announced that it would be closing all of its stores by October, CNN reported. Sales had been declining as big-box stores like Target and Walmart expanded their home goods offerings.",

The department store chain was already struggling due to a shift from brick-and-mortar retail to e-commerce, and pandemic-related closures proved to be the straw that broke the camel's back. In August, Stein Mart's liquidators announced that it would be closing all of its 279 locations, CNBC reported.",

			"Costco shoppers are nutty about the store's nuts. So are the team members who source and purchase the products for the shelves. To bring a 2-pound bag of Kirkland Signature Heart Healthy Mixed Nuts, the buyers worked with suppliers of almonds, pistachios and walnuts in the San Joaquin Valley of California, and then turned to hazelnut suppliers in Turkey to find the finest quality of that nut to add to the mix, according to the Costco Connection magazine.",

Who needed a cake to serve 48? Americans revolted, started a petition drive through Change.org and got their beloved treat back. Fun fact: A Costco half-sheet cake weighs more than 9 pounds.",
			"In most states, you can buy alcohol at Costco even if you don't have a membership, and people flock to the warehouses to take advantage of a high-quality product at a low price. Speculation long has abounded as to who makes Costco's Kirkland house brand wines and liquors, but actual manufacturers remain a mystery. In a February 2021 article, Thrillist tried mightily to come up with the answers, and its expert couldn't precisely name the manufacturer but compared several Kirkland products favorably with the biggest names in liquor.",
			"When it came to the Kirkland Signature Blended Canadian Whisky, for example, the expert surmised it was made by noted producer Crown Royal. The cost difference? A 1.75-liter bottle of Kirkland brand sells for $18.99, while a 750-milliliter bottle of Crown Royal starts at about $24.99 at discount retailers.",

Costco has mastered pizza-making efficiency, keeping the price down, but that efficiency also has led to consistency in taste.",
			"According to Kitchn, a daily online food magazine, a Costco pizza begins in a flattening machine, which presses the dough before it makes its way to the sauce robot for covering. Employees then cover it in mozzarella and provolone cheeses before the pizza hits the oven. Kitchn reported the pizza ovens need just six minutes for the finished product.",

			"Costco's olive oil has a cult following. Samin Nosrat, the host of \"Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat\" on Netflix (and the writer of the book), told The Seattle Times in an interview in 2019 that the Kirkland brand organic extra-virgin olive oil is her go-to for everyday use. \"It's really good!\" she said.",
			"And also really affordable. A 2-liter (about 67 ounces) bottle of Kirkland Signature Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil costs $15.99 on the Costco website. At Trader Joe's, the<span> Trader Giotto's Selezione Sicilian Extra Virgin Olive Oil sells for $7.99 for 16.9 ounces.</span>",
			"Some of the enduring images of the early days of COVID-19's arrival in the United States -- even before it was declared a pandemic -- were the photos of  Costco shoppers packing their carts with what would become a valuable commodity: toilet paper. They stocked up on a higher-quality paper at a value price; a New York Times analysis of toilet from February 2021 gave the Kirkland Signature brand high marks for wet strength, softness and cleaning power (it didn't fare as well for absorption). With the Delta variant causing continued COVID-19 concerns, in late September, Costco announced it would be limiting per-person sales of key items, including toilet paper, to maintain supply.",
			"Costco is the tire store for many car owners, and Readers' Digest said there is a secret to the store's tire pricing: A different brand goes on sale each month. If the tire you want is available at a price you don't want to pay, wait a few months if you can. The Costco website also features offers to save you bundles on a set of four tires. A bonus if you buy tires here: Costco will repair flats and rotate tires at no cost as long as you have them.",
			"That could be a considerable saving, with flat repairs typically starting at about $15 and tire rotation costing $35 and up. Tires should be rotated, in general, every 6,000 to 8,000 miles.",
			"It really isn't a secret that Costco shoppers love the store's legendary $4.99 rotisserie chicken, and shoppers gobbled up about 101 million of them in 2020, Reader's Digest reported. Costco has steadfastly refused to raise the price on them through the years, even if it is taking a loss on each one sold. <span>Reader's Digest reported the chain loses as much as $40 million per year on the chickens, but those chickens keep shoppers coming through the door. Who among us hasn't walked in for a $5 chicken and walked out with $100 worth of stuff in the cart?</span>",
			"When is $40 worth $50? When you buy a Cinemark gift card through Costco's website. Members can spend $39.99 to purchase a $50 gift card for the theater chain, which can be used for admission tickets or refreshments. Costco has other great deals on gift cards, too, including a $50 card for Jiffy Lube for just $37.99 or a $50 card at sports retailer Fanatics for $39.99.",
			"When it comes to buying a computer, camera, home theater system, tablet or television, consumers have lots of choices of stores and online sites. But Costco has developed a following as the place to buy electronics for one reason: free tech support. The tech team is available from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. PT, seven days a week, to answer questions about setup or to troubleshoot problems. While tech support isn't necessarily a \"product,\" its availability drives business to the store.",

			"The cost of sales was $801.1 million, up 8% year over year.<br/><br/>The company’s first-quarter 2023 gross margin expanded 170 basis points (bps) to 52.8%, driven by pricing actions, lower freight-in costs and reduced aluminum can costs. The metric increased on a sequential basis due to the aforementioned factors. On the flip side, elevated ingredients and other input costs, as well as co-packing fees, acted as deterrents.<br/><br/>Operating expenses grew 9.4% year over year to $412.8 million. The increase can be attributed to higher payroll expenses, as the company is purchasing aluminum cans from local sources. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses contracted 50 bps to 24.3%. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, expanded 20 bps year over year to 8.8%.<br/><br/>Distribution costs, as a percentage of net sales, contracted 90 bps to 4.5%, driven by reduced freight out expenses, somewhat offset by higher warehouse expenses stemming from rising raw materials and finished product inventories in the United States and EMEA.  General and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, expanded 10 bps year over year to 11%.<br/><br/>Operating income of $485.1 million rose 21.4% year over year, driven by an increase in the gross margin, as well as lower operating expenses.

			"Thanks, Tom. The company achieved record first quarter net sales of $1.7 billion in the 2023 first quarter, 11.9% higher than net sales of $1.52 billion in the 2022 comparable period and 15.3% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 first quarter was 52.8% compared with 51.1% in the comparative 2022 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 first quarter as compared to the 2022 first quarter was primarily the result of pricing actions, decreased freight-in costs and decreased aluminum can costs. <br/>Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased on a sequential quarterly basis to 52.8% in the 2023 first quarter from 51.8% in the 2022 fourth quarter and 51.3% in the 2022 third quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding gross profit for the company's Alcohol Brands segment increased on a sequential quarterly basis to 53.6% in the 2023 first quarter from 52.5% in the 2022 fourth quarter and 51.9% in the 2022 third quarter. The depletion of our remaining higher-cost imported can inventories will continue over the next few quarters, which should be fully utilized during 2023. <br/>Operating expenses for the 2023 first quarter were $412.8 million compared to $377.2 million in the 2022 first quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2023 first quarter were 24.3% compared with 24.8% in the 2022 first quarter. <br/>Distribution expenses for the 2023 first quarter decreased to $76.3 million or 4.5% of net sales compared to $81.4 million or 5.4% of net sales in the 2022 first quarter. The $5.1 million decrease in distribution expenses was primarily due to decreased freight-out expenses of $15.7 million partially offset by higher warehouse expenses of $9.9 million as a result of higher raw materials and finished product inventories in the United States and EMEA. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increased payroll expenses. <br/>We are now purchasing aluminum cans from local sources globally. We have rebuilt finished product inventory levels globally to return to our orbit strategy of producing in closer proximity to our customers. The cost of repositioning finished products to distribution centers are included in freight-in costs. The company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment. <br/>Operating income for the 2023 first quarter increased 21.4% to $485.1 million from $399.5 million in the 2022 comparative quarter. The effective tax rate for the 2023 first quarter was 20.1% compared with 25% in the 2022 first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the increase in the stock compensation deduction in the 2023 first quarter. Net income increased 35.1% to $397.4 million as compared to $294.2 million in the 2022 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2023 first quarter increased 36.6% to $0.38 from $0.27 in the first quarter of 2022. <br/>Due to continued cost pressures, the company implemented pricing actions in the United States in 2022 as well as in many other international markets in 2022 and in the first quarter of 2023. The company plans to implement additional price increases in a number of other international markets during the remainder of the 2023 year. In the United States, the company implemented an additional price increase on its 18.6 ounce and 24-ounce lines effective April 1, 2023. We will continue to review further opportunities for pricing actions in order to mitigate inflationary pressures. <br/>According to the Nielsen report, for the 13 weeks through April 22, 2023, for all outlets combined, namely: convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 12.7% versus the same period a year ago.

Monster sales increased 24.8%. Monster's market share in value increased 1.7 points to 30% against the comparable period the previous year. Sales of Predator increased 71.3% and its market share increased 1.7 share points to 5.4%. <br/>The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers a single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by 1 or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. <br/>According to Nielsen, for the month of March 2023 compared to March 2022, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina to 53.5% and in Chile from 36.4% to 42.7%. In Brazil for the month end March 2023, our share increased from 42.1% to 43.9%. Monster Energy is the leading energy brand in value in Argentina, Brazil and Chile. <br/>I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of March 2023, Monster retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 14.8% to 15.8% in Belgium; from 18.3% to 20.9% in the Czech Republic; from 32.4% to 33.4% in France; from 15% to 16.6% in Germany; from 29.3% to 30.9% in Great Britain; from 28.2% to 30.4% in Italy; from 29.7% to 34.6% in Norway; from 27.9% to 28.7% in the Republic of Ireland; from 38.2% to 39.9% in Spain; and from 15.9% to 18.1% in Sweden. <br/>Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period the previous year, declined from 7.8% to 4.7% in the Netherlands; from 21.2% to 19.2% in Poland; and from 20.1% to 19% in South Africa. <br/>According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of February 2023, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year increased from 27% to 27.7% in Denmark. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year declined from 38.3% to 36.5% in Greece. <br/>According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of February 2023, Predator's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 23% to 31% in Kenya; and from 14.7% to 19.5% in Nigeria. <br/>According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share value for the 4 weeks ending April 9, 2023 increased from 13.5% to 16.6% as compared to the same period the previous year. Mother's market share in value increased from 10.3% to 10.7%. <br/>According to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share value for the 4 weeks ended April 16, 2023 increased from 12.9% to 14.6% compared to the same period the previous year. Live+ market share in value increased from 6.1% to 6.2%; and Mother's market share in value decreased from 5.7% to 5.1%. <br/>According to INTAGE in Japan, in the month ending March 2023, Monster's market share value in the convenience store channel, as compared to the same period the previous year, grew from 52.5% to 52.7%. <br/>According to Nielsen in South Korea, in the month ending March 2023, Monster's market share in value in all outlets combined as compared to the same period the previous year decreased from 59.4% to 56.8%. <br/>We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or 4-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. <br/>Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $622.9 million, 36.7% of total net sales in the 2023 first quarter compared to $553.4 million or 36.4% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2022. <br/>Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $52 million in the 2023 first quarter. <br/>Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. <br/>In EMEA, net sales in the 2023 first quarter increased 5.7% in dollars and increased 14.8% in local currencies over the same period in 2022. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter was 30.7% compared to 29.6% in the same quarter in 2022. <br/>We are also pleased that in the 2023 first quarter, Monster gained market share in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Norway, Republic of Ireland, Spain and Sweden. <br/>In Asia Pacific, net sales in the 2023 first quarter increased 11.6% in dollars and increased 22.8% in local currencies over the same period in 2022. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 44.4% versus 40.9% over the same period in 2022. <br/>Net sales in Japan in the 2023 first quarter decreased 12% in dollars but increased 1.8% in local currency. In South Korea, net sales increased 4.3% in dollars and increased 11.4% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2022. Monster remains the market leader in Japan and South Korea. <br/>In China, net sales in the first quarter increased 68.3% in dollars and increased 81.7% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2022. We remain optimistic about the prospects for the Monster brand in China. <br/>In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales increased 46.9% in dollars and 53.8% in local currencies. <br/>In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2023 first quarter increased 30.8% in dollars and increased 40.4% in local currencies over the same period in 2022. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 33% for the 2023 first quarter versus 35.4% in the 2022 first quarter. We note that gross profit in the region was adversely affected by a fire at a warehouse in Chile. We are implementing measures to improve gross profit in this region despite such challenges in Chile and continuing challenges with importing raw materials in Argentina. <br/>In Brazil, net sales in the 2023 first quarter increased by 28.5% in dollars and 22.5% in local currency. Net sales in Mexico increased 31.9% in dollars and 21.4% in local currency in the 2023 first quarter. Net sales in Chile increased 36.3% in dollars and increased 36% in local currency in the 2023 first quarter. Net sales in Argentina increased 13% in dollars and increased 98.8% in local currency in the 2023 first quarter. <br/>I will now provide an update on our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, which will be referred to as VPX, the maker of Bang Energy drinks. We previously discussed the trademark infringement arbitration in which an arbitrator found against VPX and awarded Monster Energy Company, or MEC and Orange Bang, Inc. $175 million in damages, attorney's fees and costs and an ongoing 5% royalty on future sales of certain Bang Energy products. VPX has appealed the judgment. <br/>Additionally, on September 29, 2022, a jury in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, returned to voting to awarding MEC approximately $293 million in damages on its claims against VPX for false advertising, misappropriation of trade secrets and interference with Monster's contract over shelf space with certain key retailers. <br/>On April 12, 2023, the District Court granted MEC's motion for permanent injunction, which, amongst other things, enjoins VPX and former CEO, Jack Owoc, for falsely or deceptively claiming that Bang or any other beverages contain creatine or a form of creatine. The parties have completed briefing the remaining post-trial issues. <br/>On October 10, 2022, VPX, along with certain of its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the Southern District of Florida. While those proceedings are moving forward, VPX has undertaken to make interim royalty payments subject to potential clawback in certain circumstances. <br/>On February 14, 2023, VPX made its first royalty payment in the amount of approximately $3.6 million. The company will not recognize either award or the royalty payments until such time as they are realized or realizable. As this litigation on the bankruptcy proceedings are subjudicate, we will not be answering further questions on those matters on today's call. <br/>In the first quarter, we initially launched the Beast Unleashed in 6 states through a network of beer distributors. We are pleased with the early results and are continuing to expand distribution into additional markets with the goal of being national by the end of the year. Net sales of the Beast Unleashed during the first quarter were $20.5 million. <br/>We recently relaunched Wild Basin Hard Seltzer with new packaging and great new flavors and taste profiles. We are refreshing the Dale's beer brand, and we'll be introducing Dale's American Light Lager as part of the refresh. We are planning to launch a new flavored malt beverage line within the next few months. Our Alcohol Beverage innovation pipeline is robust. We look forward to sharing news of additional new products in the near future. <br/>We launched a number of new products in the United States in the 2023 first quarter. In January 2023, Monster Energy Zero Sugar was launched at retail. Monster Energy Zero Sugar is available in 16-ounce cans and was specifically developed as an indistinguishable 0 sugar analog of our original unique Monster Energy Green flavor. <br/>In February 2023, we launched a new flavor within our highly successful Monster Ultra line with Monster Energy Ultra Strawberry Dreams available in 16-ounce cans. <br/>In March 2023, we launched Reign Storm, which is positioned as a line of total wellness energy drinks in 12-ounce sleek cans to address a compelling opportunity in the energy drink category. Reign Storm is available in 4 flavors: Valencia Orange, Kiwi Blend, Peach Nectarine and Harvest Grape. Also in March, we launched Rehab Monster Wild Berry Tea in 16-ounce cans. We are continuing to expand the distribution of Monster Tour Water in still and sparkling variants into additional states. <br/>We launched several new SKUs in the first quarter in 2023 in Canada. In February 2023, we launched Monster Ultra Peachy Keen, Punch Monster Aussie Style Lemonade and Reign REIGNbow Sherbet. In March 2023, we launched Monster Zero Sugar in Canada. <br/>We launched several new SKUs in the 2023 first quarter in Latin America. In Brazil, we launched Monster Ultra Watermelon. Additionally, we revamped our previous Khaos product into the new Monster Juice Khaotic. In Mexico, Predator Red Apple launched at retail to further expand our affordable energy offerings. In Uruguay, we launched our second Ultra SKU with Monster Ultra Paradise. In Paraguay and Bolivia, we launched our first juice SKU with Monster Juice Mango Loco. And additionally, in Bolivia, we launched Fury Gold Strike. <br/>In the First quarter of 2023 in Australia, we launched 2 Java Monster SKUs, Java Monster Mean Bean and Java Monster Loca Moca. In EMEA, in the first quarter of 2023, we launched Monster Reserve Watermelon, Ultra Gold, Ultra Rosa, Ultra Watermelon, Juicy Aussie Lemonade and Juice Khaotic in a number of countries. <br/>During the 2023 first quarter, we also launched additional SKUs of Burn, Predator and Reign in certain countries. In EMEA, as part of an ongoing pan-EMEA launch, we expanded the distribution of our Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero Sugar Energy Drink to an additional 22 EMEA markets in the first quarter of 2023, to be followed by another 8 markets in the second quarter of 2023. <br/>During the first quarter of 2023, we launched Monster Ultra Paradise in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. In April 2023, we launched Monster Reserve Watermelon in Japan. We are planning to introduce the Predator brand in additional countries in APAC in the course of 2023. <br/>We estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including the Alcohol Brand segment, April 2023 sales were approximately 9.9% higher than the comparable April '22 sales and 7.9% higher than April 2022, excluding the Alcohol Brand segment. We estimate April 2023 sales, including the Alcohol Brand segment, to be approximately 7.2% higher than in April 2022 and 5.1% higher than in April 2022, excluding the Alcohol Brand segment. April 2023 had 1 less selling day compared to April 2022. <br/>In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production. <br/>In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintained inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. <br/>In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, the energy category continues to grow globally; two, we are pleased to report that our pricing actions, which have been implemented to partially mitigate inflationary pressures have not significantly impacted consumer demand. Three, we are seeing improvements in our gross profit margins on a quarterly sequential basis. Four, our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower land costs to our EMEA region. <br/>Five, we are enthusiastic for our 2023 new product innovations, notably, Monster Energy Zero Sugar, Ultra Strawberry Dreams, Reign Storm and Tour Water in the United States and Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero Sugar in EMEA. <br/>We are pleased with the early results from the launch of the Beast Unleashed. We are continuing to expand distribution with the goal of being national by the end of the year. <br/>We are excited by the additional alcohol opportunities that the CANarchy acquisition presents. We are pleased with the initial results of our launch of Reign Storm, our new line of total wellness energy drinks. Eight, finally, we are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in additional number of international countries. <br/>I would now like to open the floor to questions about the quarter.",

			"(Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from Peter Grom from UBS.",
			"<strong>Peter K. Grom</strong>",
			"Maybe just 2 quick margin questions, if I may. So one, I know you don't want to get into guidance, but you continue to comment on the sequential margin performance or improvement. So with pricing coming in and cost moderating, should we expect to see sequential improvement in gross margin from here as we move through the year? <br/>And then just somewhat related, as we look at selling expense as a percentage of sales today versus 2019, it's down quite a bit. So as you look ahead, is this high single-digit rate that we have seen over the past couple of years sustainable? Or would you be looking to take that higher over time, particularly as gross margin begins to improve?",
			"<strong>Hilton H. Schlosberg</strong>",
			"So addressing your first question on gross margin, as you know, we don't give guidance. But what we can say and what we have said in previous quarters where we've spoken about the price increases, we have rolling price increases in EMEA during the whole year. So that will escalate as the year goes through. <br/>In the U.S., we had a price increase, as you know, late last year, and we had a price increase April 1 in our larger sizes, the 19.2, 18.4, and the 24-ounce cans. So that's something that will be reflected continually as the year goes through. <br/>In addition, we took up some pricing later on in the year in LatAm. And that -- and some in LatAm in 2023 as well. In Asia Pacific, we largely took up pricing in Q1 of this year. So there will be a benefit, I believe, from pricing as we go through 2023. With regard to costs, that's something that we continue to evaluate. We know that, for example, aluminum has kind of stabilized, which is positive for, I think, for us. <br/>And we've also had a situation where we're seeing freight rates reducing. And rebalanced freight in 2 sections in our P&amp;L: freight-in for materials and for finished goods as they move to distribution centers are regarded as part of cost of sales; and freight-out is obviously regarded as an operating expense. So we are seeing some improvements. We mentioned, I think, on previous calls and in the script today that there are some challenges in our cost of sales, including what we've seen in certain ingredients and co-packing fees. <br/>So overall, I think -- I could see a situation where we have the price benefits. They seem as if they have been sensibly executed and that we haven't had major resistance from customers. So I think that gives you the background probably to make your own assessment. <br/>And then on your second question on selling expenses, we work towards a budget on selling expenses, which we believe are necessary to execute our plan. And what those budgets are and where they end up with is a factor that we very seriously consider in dealing with the needs of our consumer and the needs of the market. So we don't really compare it to percentage sales. I know we -- at the end of the quarter, everybody else does. But we look at the needs of the marketing programs and what we need to do to keep our brands exciting in the eyes of the consumers.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi.",
			"<strong>Filippo Falorni</strong>",
			"You talked about the energy drink category remaining solid. Can you talk about what you're expecting in the balance of the year for the category? Are you seeing any signs of potential weakness at the low end of the consumer base or you're seeing trends held up in the U.S., particularly?",
			"<strong>Hilton H. Schlosberg</strong>",
			"So we don't give guidance -- Rodney, you're going to respond to that?",
			"<strong>Rodney Cyril Sacks</strong>",
			"As Hilton said, we don't give guidance and the category has -- in line with other consumer products, seeing a little bit of a slowing. I think there's been a lot of price increases across not only the energy category, but all beverage and consumer products. And so there has been a little bit of slowing. I think there's been a little bit of trimming of benefits under the SNAP programs that were increased during COVID, and those are sort of being pulled back a little bit generally now. So I think you would see a little bit of a sort of rationalization by buyers as they have slightly less disposable income. But again, I think that will settle down. <br/>We are overall, though, if you look at the numbers we gave you the Nielsen numbers, there is still healthy growth in the energy drink category as a category. It's continuing to grow and expand. But other than the direction you're seeing from Nielsen, we really can't and won't give any further direction. But obviously, we think that certainly in dollar terms, the category will continue to grow. In actual volumes, there may be a little bit of a slowing, but I think that we will think that will be more than made up by dollar increases in pricing.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs.",
			"<strong>Bonnie Lee Herzog</strong>",
			"I guess I wanted to ask a little bit about some of the innovation. Just maybe a little more color on Zero Sugar, The Beast, Reign Storm, how they're performing and whether they're meeting your expectations in terms of buy-in from retailers and shelf base allocation. I guess I'm hearing you've got a fair amount of incremental space. So just wanted to verify that with you. And then wanted to understand on Zero Sugar, in particular, you shipped most of that during Q1. Are you still expecting to kind of roll that out in certain markets in Q2?",
			"<strong>Hilton H. Schlosberg</strong>",
			"Okay. So if you look at Zero Sugar, we launched Zero Sugar and we rolled it out in Q1. So most markets, by far the majority, rolled out Zero Sugar in Q1. As regards to Zero Sugar, we have actually been very pleased with the results. We had good expectations for the product and our expectations seem to have been realized. We're not seeing a big dip in Green. So a lot of people have asked questions about cannibalization. But we're not seeing a big dip in Green at all. I mean, Green seems very much to be holding its own. <br/>So I think that as we look at shelf space, obviously, we've negotiated very actively this year for additional shelf space, and we have achieved really commendable increases in shelf space, not only in convenience, not only in the convenience independents, but across the various channels.",
			"<strong>Rodney Cyril Sacks</strong>",
			"The only thing I would add, Bonnie, is internationally, we do have plans to also roll out the Zero Sugar into a number of international markets, but that it's not going to go everywhere at the same time. We have other things on the agenda that need to roll out. So there will be an orderly rollout of other innovation internationally. But in many markets, including in EMEA, we will be rolling out Zero Sugar as well.",
			"<strong>Hilton H. Schlosberg</strong>",
			"Yes. And we just launched it in Canada as well. So really exciting times, I think, for that particular product.",
			"<strong>Rodney Cyril Sacks</strong>",
			"With regard to the expectations, Bonnie, Reign Storm really was launched right at the end of the first quarter. So it's just too early to tell, but obviously, we are optimistic about it. Again, and with regard to The Beast, we rolled it out slowly, and we're trying to do that in a cautious way. And so far, the results sales, some of the repeat sales have also been encouraging. But again, it's early on. We have a lot of additional innovation in alcohol that we are looking at and planning. So we're quite excited. It takes time, and we are rolling it out through this whole new distribution system, which we are continuing to build distributor by distributor.<br/>So it's taking time to get there, but as we said on the call, we hope to be national by the end of the year. We hope to have additional products. So the whole system, I think, is working, moving forward according to plan.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities.",
			"<strong>Christopher Michael Carey</strong>",
			"Just one clarification or maybe if you could help, the 18.6 and the 24-ounce, how meaningful are those as a percentage of your overall portfolio? Or is there just any way, frame the size of that price increase as a contribution to total business? <br/>And then just a bigger picture one, not a left field a little bit, but I get questions pretty often just about succession planning and long-term succession planning on Monster and how strong is the bench. And how much of that bench building is going on behind closed doors and just -- it comes up and off that I thought maybe this would be an interesting place to just maybe offer some perspective on just how you think about developing talent and developing talent for the long term. So thanks for the -- maybe a little bit of help on the scope of the pricing and just on talent development.",
			"<strong>Hilton H. Schlosberg</strong>",
			"Yes, Chris, I would refer you to the Nielsen numbers. And you'll see that those larger sizes are less than 10%, probably in the 6% to 8% range. But if you look at Nielsen, you'll be able to get a good assessment of that percentage. Secondly, on succession, obviously, the Monster Board is -- and Rodney and myself are really concerned about succession. And it's something that we are addressing and we continue to address on an ongoing basis. <br/>We have a very -- in our view, a deep strength in the bench of the team below us that are being developed and are growing, and we are helping them develop. So I think from that perspective, it's something that ourselves, the Board, are very well aware of, and we are continuing to address that issue. However, I don't think Rodney is going anywhere in the foreseeable future, and frankly, neither am I. So we're here and we'll help develop and segue, when the time is right, a new management team.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan.",
			"<strong>Andrea Faria Teixeira</strong>",
			"I just have a clarification. So going back to Bonnie's question on how accretive Monster Zero has been against Ultra. In absolute terms in numbers in the U.S., it seems that has been a great launch based on the Nielsen data. But obviously, as you look at Ultra, it also has been coming at some deceleration, which obviously one would expect. <br/>Can you comment on who your -- first of all, how is it tracking against plan? And in terms of shelf productivity that you pointed out that you're gaining distribution and trying to make it obviously accretive, how is it, number one, tracking against plan, and number two, how you're seeing that going above and beyond Ultra?",
			"<strong>Hilton H. Schlosberg</strong>",
			"Okay. So remember that we had a product called Absolutely Zero, and Zero Sugar is really the new variant of Absolutely Zero. So it's a product that was in the market that has been replaced by Zero Sugar. So when you compare the numbers for Zero Sugar, you could see that on an ACV basis, we've moved from 42% from Absolutely Zero to 72% for Zero Sugar. So the distribution of Zero Sugar is increasing and it's climbing. <br/>It's not that it's a new product. We had, as I said, a product called Absolutely Zero. And so when we look at Zero Sugar, we look at our plans and we look at our plans for Ultra, we have been very satisfied so far with the launch of Zero Sugar. You look at the ACV growth and the sales per point, and it's something that we really -- and I said this earlier, we really are very excited with Zero Sugar.",
			"<strong>Rodney Cyril Sacks</strong>",
			"Just maybe I would just add on the Ultra side. We have had a really successful launch of Ultra Strawberry Dreams. I think that some of the ASV, if you look at your Nielsen, you'll see some of the ASV or some of the additional flavors of Ultra have, in fact, decreased a little. I think that's something we just need to look at and attend to. <br/>I think as you go through this change and introducing of new flavors, sometimes some of these additional SKUs that are not the top 3 or 4 or 5 sometimes get a little bit lost in the wash. So that's where we see a little bit of a drop off in some of those additional flavors. But I think there's -- we think that they're solid and sound products. And I think we just need to just make sure we focus on just reestablishing some of the distribution levels on those, and we think those sales will continue to increase. <br/>Sales of Ultra as a brand or sub-brand have gone up in the United States and internationally. But I think that we've had, as I said, some of those flanker sort of flavors are we need to just put some focus behind which we are doing.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And our next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel.",
			"<strong>Mark Stiefel Astrachan</strong>",
			"Two housekeeping questions. One, cash balance, it keeps growing. Any thoughts on how you'd like to implement spending some of it, share repurchase? It was nice to see there was some interest income this quarter. I assume we should all be thinking that, that continues to grow. And then on the Alcohol Brand's gross margin, the implied number this quarter was a little better sequentially than 4Q. Anything there kind of beneath the surface that we should consider in trying to model that business? Because it's clearly a lot harder to see what's going on there than sort of the legacy business.",
			"<strong>Rodney Cyril Sacks</strong>",
			"On the alcohol side, I think that what we did was we had quite a drop-off in the Seltzer business which is part of the brands that we acquired. And that affected in an operating business, where they're running their own production, that affected their overhead costs because you've got some fixed costs. So as you noted in the earlier last quarter of last year, we reported on the margins were really very thin on what we call the legacy business. <br/>Those margins are improving. We're busy sort of refitting the one line out to be able to increase the capacity for doing the Beast products. And as we go forward, we will start seeing an improvement in the margin in the legacy business. The margins on the Beast side are healthier, quite a lot better than on the legacy craft business side. And as again, as those are probably smaller, lower now than they'll be as we start getting some scale, we are doing some co-packing, we will be using our own facility, and we'll obviously be maximizing that. And as we go forward, we will start working on using additional co-packers where we will actually lower our costs. So we do think there will be additional margin going forward. But it is a thinner margin product than we obviously are traditionally used to seeing on the Monster side. <br/>And maybe Hilton, you want to take the question on the cash side?",
			"<strong>Hilton H. Schlosberg</strong>",
			"Yes, Mark, we continually are examining options to deal with our cash balances and something that, again, is a Board issue that is receiving attention. So I really don't want to comment more than we have, that our intention is to hopefully buy back shares, continue that program. But we are looking at some opportunities for further investments. And that's too premature to talk about them. But there are a number of possibilities that we're looking at. And in addition, it is our plan to continue buying back our shares.",

			"And at this time, we'll be concluding today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for any closing remarks.",

We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy, and we remain committed to continuing to innovate, to develop and differentiate our brands, and to expand the company both at home and abroad and, in particular, capitalizing on our relationship with the Coca-Cola Bottler system. <br/>We believe that we are well positioned in the beverage industry and continue to be optimistic about the future of our company.

			"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A new analysis of Walmart's pricing strategy reveals it has consistently kept grocery prices lower than competitors while generally hiking prices at rates far below U.S. inflation, even while the firm now faces allegations of using its clout to gain unfair advantages over rivals.",
			"Data analytics firm Dataweave compared the prices of 589 name-brand products in 34 categories, including coffee, soup, cereals, baking goods, batteries, personal care items and pet food exclusively for Reuters.",

			"Walmart reported net profits of $11.3 billion for its year ended Jan. 31, 2023, a 19% drop compared to last year, mainly due to restructuring charges related to its exit from the UK and Japan and a $3.3 billion opioid settlement. Gross margins also fell about 1 percentage point to 24.1%",
			"Among U.S. brick and mortar retailers, Walmart commands a 42% share, though its market share online is just 6.3% vs Amazon's 37.8%, according to market research firms. With over $400 billion in market value and operations spanning from Latin America to China, Walmart for years has used its heft to negotiate the lowest prices from suppliers.",
			"Its executives told investors this year they were leveraging metrics, including best-performing merchandise and best-performing categories, and were scrutinizing commodity costs item by item in negotiations with suppliers.",
			"Walmart in April claimed that automation in its distribution centers would also help maintain price gaps against competitors.",
			"Walmart already accounts for $1 out of every $4 spent on groceries, which has been a major focus for the world's largest retailer.",
			"U.S. inflation in 2022 soared to the highest levels since the early 1980s, making everything from food and clothing to gas and electronics more expensive.",
			"On a sample basket of 10 food items, including Kellogg's Pringles potato chips, Kraft Heinz's Miracle Whip Mayo and Del Monte's Green Beans, Walmart's prices were 4.6% cheaper than Target, 14.8% cheaper than Kroger and 17% cheaper than Amazon.",
			"This was during a time when world food prices hit record highs and U.S. food-at-home prices rose in the double digits.",
			"Food-at-home prices, or prices of food bought at grocery stores and supermarkets, are expected to rise a further 6.6% this year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
			"\"The data shows Walmart's power over suppliers and its potential to gain market share from rivals like Amazon,\" said Parul Jain, a professor of finance and economics at Rutgers Business School, who reviewed the data for Reuters.",
			"Walmart, in an email to Reuters, said the data \"supports our commitment to Every Day Low Price (EDLP),\" referring to its strategy of setting low prices on products instead of relying on discounts and promotions to drive sales.",
			"The National Grocers' Association and the Wholesale Grocers Association, which represent independent and regional U.S. grocery chains, have in recent years been urging federal lawmakers and regulators to clamp down on the clout grocery giants including Walmart wield over suppliers and to more stringently enforce the Robinson-Patman Act, which prohibits price discrimination by manufacturers against retailers.",
			"Last week, consumers and retailers sued Walmart and battery maker Energizer for allegedly conspiring to raise prices of disposable batteries, in a program Energizer dubbed internally as Project Atlas. According to the lawsuit, Energizer agreed \"under pressure from Walmart\" to inflate wholesale battery practices for other retailers starting around January 2018 and required those retailers not to undercut Walmart on price.",
			"In an email to Reuters on Thursday, Walmart said it takes \"allegations like this seriously and will respond in court as appropriate.\" The data set, which included batteries in the basket of goods, showed that Walmart sold Energizer batteries at a significant discount to rivals. A 2-pack of Alkaline A23 batteries, for example, sold for $4.49 at Walmart vs. $4.64 at Amazon and $5.22 at Target. Similarly, at least two different types of Energizer coin batteries sold at Walmart were found to be between 30% and 35% cheaper than the next lowest priced rival.",

			"In September 2020, Patricio sold part of the company's cheese business for $3.2 billion to France's Groupe Lactalis. That sale was unveiled at an investor day, where the company outlined a more focused set of product priorities.",
			"He promised to boost marketing by 30% in top brands such as Mac &amp; Cheese, Lunchables, and Philadelphia cream cheese while also cutting $2 billion in costs through 2024.",

			"All of this turnaround work came alongside the COVID-19 pandemic, which upended supply chains and triggered a boom in eating at home.",
			"Today, Kraft appears to be a different company.",
			"For one, Patricio is fresh off a first quarter earnings call where he promised $2.5 billion in cost savings by 2027 — up from the aforementioned $2 billion. Net sales rose 7.3% from a year ago to $6.5 billion, powered by demand for Lunchables and higher prices. Adjusted operating profits improved 10.3% year over year to $1.5 billion.",

			"Shares have rallied from those early 2020 lows to more than $40.",
			"\"Kraft Heinz benefited significantly during the unique environment of the pandemic and lockdown, allowing the company to execute its new enterprise-wide strategy, reinvesting more heavily into the business, and doing this while growing sales and EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization],\" Stifel analyst Matthew Smith said. \"We believe this environment has accelerated the company's transformation, setting the stage for achieving a stronger growth profile more quickly in future years.\"",
			"Smith rates Kraft Heinz stock a Buy.",
			"Meanwhile, Kraft Heinz is back to doing what a packaged food company does best — creating new products that gain new shoppers. Patricio told Yahoo Finance Live that the company will soon launch frozen Mac &amp; Cheese while also expanding into frozen dinners.",
			"The company has also since expanded Lunchables into schools.",
			"Patricio sounds like a CEO that amidst the budding turnaround, has fallen back in the good graces of its largest shareholder Buffett and his Berkshire disciples (Berkshire owns 26.5% of Kraft Heinz).",

First-quarter growth was broad-based, with net bookings increasing year-over-year in Call of Duty, Candy Crush, Warcraft, Overwatch, and Diablo. Call of Duty in-game net bookings on console and PC grew strongly year-over-year in the first quarter.</span><br/>",
			"<span>The Zacks analyst believes that Diablo Immortal on mobile and PC also contributed to Blizzard’s first-quarter net bookings growth. Candy Crush payer numbers again grew year-over-year, and Candy Crush was the top-grossing game franchise in the U.S. app stores for the 23rd quarter in a row.</span><br/>",

			"Investors looking for stocks in the Retail - Discount Stores sector might want to consider either Ross Stores (ROST) or Costco (COST). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.",
			"There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.",
			"Ross Stores has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Costco has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that ROST has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.",

			"Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.",

This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. COST currently has a PEG ratio of 3.69.",
			"Another notable valuation metric for ROST is its P/B ratio of 8.26. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, COST has a P/B of 9.54.",
			"Based on these metrics and many more, ROST holds a Value grade of B, while COST has a Value grade of C.",

		"content": [
			"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Conagra Brands (CAG). Shares have lost about 2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.",
			"Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Conagra Brands due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.",
			"Conagra Brands delivered third-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the top and bottom lines advanced year over year and the latter comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results reflect strength in the company’s brands and the ongoing execution of the Conagra Way playbook. Robust pricing efforts with modest elasticities fueled top-line growth. The company continued to deliver improved service levels and productivity, which helped it improve the adjusted gross and operating margin, even amid greater-than-expected industry-wide supply-chain hurdles. Every segment registered growth in the adjusted operating profit.<br/><br/>Based on its year-to-date performance, continued business momentum and current operating landscape, Conagra raised its adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal 2023. However, it narrowed its guidance range for organic net sales growth and adjusted operating margin.",
			"Conagra’s quarterly adjusted EPS came in at 76 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 64 cents and our estimate of 62 cents. The bottom line increased 31% year over year, mainly due to the higher gross profit.<br/><br/>Conagra generated net sales of $3,086.5 million, which advanced 5.9% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stood at $3,092.3 million and our estimate was $3,047.9 million. The year-over-year sales increase resulted from higher organic sales, partly negated by currency headwinds (to the tune of 0.2%). Organic net sales rose 6.1% due to a price/mix, increasing 15.1%. The price/mix was backed by the company’s inflation-induced pricing actions. The upside was somewhat negated by volumes, which dropped 9%, affected by the elasticity effect stemming from pricing actions and supply-chain hurdles.<br/><br/>The adjusted gross profit jumped 23.9% to $869 million. The adjusted gross margin expanded 409 basis points to 28.1%. Gains from increased organic sales and productivity more than offset the effects of the cost of goods sold inflation (including adverse commodity positions) and unfavorable operating leverage. Adjusted SG&amp;A expenses, excluding advertising and promotional (A&amp;P) costs, increased 12.4% to $266 million due to higher incentive compensation. A&amp;P costs came in at $81 million, up 23.9% from the year-ago quarter’s level. Adjusted EBITDA (including equity method investment earnings and the pension and post-retirement non-service income) rose 21.1% to $669 million, mainly led by the higher adjusted gross profit, partly offset by the reduced pension income.",
			"<strong>Grocery &amp; Snacks</strong>: Quarterly net sales in the segment came in at $1,243.7 million, up 3.7% year over year. Organic net sales also rose 3.7%, with the price/mix up 13.7%, fueled by positive inflation-driven pricing. Volumes declined 10% due to the elasticity impact of inflation-driven pricing actions and shortages stemming from supply-chain bottlenecks. During the quarter, CAG saw share gains in snacking categories like meat snacks and microwave popcorn as well as staples categories, namely refried beans and Asian sauce and marinades.<br/><br/><strong>Refrigerated &amp; Frozen</strong>: Net sales grew 5.6% to $1,307.7 million. Organic sales also rose 5.6% on a price/mix increase of 15.4%. However, volumes were down 9.8% due to the elasticity impacts of pricing and supply-chain headwind-led shortages. The company saw an improved share in plant-based protein, frozen sides and frozen breakfasts.<br/><br/><strong>International</strong>: Net sales advanced 7.7% to $259.7 million, reflecting improved organic net sales. However, the adverse impacts of foreign currency translations (to the tune of 1.8%) were a downside. Organic sales rose 9.5%, with the price/mix up 16.5% and volumes down 7%. Volumes were hurt by the elasticity effect from inflation-led pricing.<br/><br/><strong>Foodservice</strong>: Sales advanced 17.3% (also organically) to $275.4 million. The price/mix improved 18.5% on favorable inflation-driven pricing. Volumes declined 1.2%, mainly due to the elasticity impact of inflation-driven pricing actions.",
			"The company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $71.2 million, senior long-term debt, excluding current installments, of $8,081.2 million and total stockholders’ equity of $8,938.3 million. During the quarter, Conagra paid out a quarterly dividend of 33 cents per share.",
			"For fiscal 2023, organic net sales are anticipated to rise 7-7.5% now, up from the prior view of 7-8% growth. The adjusted operating margin is anticipated in the band of 15.5-15.6% compared with the 15.3-15.6% projected earlier. Management now envisions an adjusted EPS in the range of $2.70-$2.75, suggesting 14-17% year-over-year growth. The adjusted EPS growth was earlier expected in the band of $2.60-$2.70, suggesting 10-14% year-over-year growth. For fiscal 2023, capital expenditures are likely to be about $370 million, interest expenses are expected at roughly $410 million and the adjusted effective tax rate is anticipated at around 24%. Management expects the pension income to be nearly $25 million.",
			"<b>How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?</b>",
			"It turns out, estimates review have trended downward during the past month.",
			"<b>VGM Scores</b>",
			"At this time, Conagra Brands has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a D. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.",
			"Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.",

			"Kraft Heinz CEO Miguel Patricio joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the company earnings, leadership changes, investor sentiment, reinventing legacy food brands, and the outlook for Kraft Heinz.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JULIE HYMAN:</span> You mentioned ketchup and mustard, Brian Sozzi. Tell us more.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Oh, you know I did that on purpose, Julie Hyman. That was a setup for the interview. I see you know what, we've been working together for a long time and you just know each other. But to that end, I caught up with Kraft Heinz CEO Miguel Patricio ahead of the Berkshire meeting to get a sense on his turnaround and why is all this important?",
			"It is because Berkshire Hathaway still owns about 28% of Kraft Heinz, has three board members on that Kraft Heinz board, notably, likely Buffett successor in Greg Abel. So I talked to Patricio about the company's turnaround and if there is, in fact, a turnaround brewing.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MIGUEL PATRICIO:</span> Four years ago, we were a depressed company. And then when I was starting working on the strategy, came the pandemic. And I thought, Brian, that transforming the company through Teams would be impossible. But it was not.",
			"And at that time we were downgraded to junk or to high yield. We had a big debt. We were able to pay $10 billion of debt. And two years later, we were in investment grade again. And with that, we created momentum. And we start transforming the company in all parts of the company, from sales to finance, from marketing to supply, and this has been a journey. We are in a very different place today and very engaged, and very energized, and very optimistic about the future.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Well, we just came off your earnings. And I think your earnings, Miguel, really surprised a lot of people on Wall Street. And my question to you is this, do you think investors are missing a turnaround story at a storied brand like Kraft Heinz?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MIGUEL PATRICIO:</span> I mean, I think that we have to earn it. And reputation, you build with time. It's not from a day to another. But the truth is that we've been beating estimates, beating the market for 12 or 13 quarters in a row. So we've been proving that we know what are we doing.",
			"This quarter we grew 9.4% in net sales, 12% or 11.9% in EBITDA. We grew 13.3% in adjusted EPS. We grew margin and parts of the business that we-- like emerging markets and food service that we told the market that would be representing 2/3 of our growth really but really excelled the expectations of the market. Emerging markets, we grew by 23%, and food service, we grew by 29%. So it was a very good, very, very good quarter.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> One thing I think you've done really well with inside Kraft Heinz, Miguel, is driving more focus in the organization. Now, there is no secret that investment dollars were starved under prior management. You came in giving more of your top brands more investment, more room to grow. Where are you at with some of those power brands and reinventing them?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MIGUEL PATRICIO:</span> So this was one of the things that we did. I think that four years ago, we were apologetic about our brands. And we thought that the future would be smaller brands and very niche brands. And we were launching a lot of different brands in the market.",
			"We did just the opposite. We focused on our core. We have incredible brands. We have $6 billion brands, you know, Heinz, Lunchables, Kraft, Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese, Lunchables. It's just incredible brands. And what we did was reinvigorate these brands.",
			"First, we renovated the brands' packaging, formulation, communication and also overseas. We put our investments in emerging markets and also in food service. And the strategy has been working. We've been better every quarter since 2019.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> And now what is next for two brands in particular? I'm very focused on the core Mac &amp; Cheese business and then a brand like Lunchables. What's next for those two brands?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MIGUEL PATRICIO:</span> Now, specifically, on brands like Mac &amp; Cheese and Lunchables, let me tell you Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese. One of the things that we have very different from the rest of the market is that we play in stable-table products like ketchup, Heinz ketchup. We play in refrigerated products like Singles or Philadelphia Cream Cheese. And we also play in frozen food. Like, we are leaders in frozen potatoes like with Ore-Ida.",
			"There's no other company that plays in these three different states of temperature. And our brands have never really navigated through the three ones, and there's a big opportunity. So like Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese, we are about to launch frozen Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese, makes all these--",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> Frozen?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MIGUEL PATRICIO:</span> Yeah, Mac &amp; Cheese Frozen is a market of close to $800 million. We never played there. And we never played because we were organized the frozen team and the refrigerator team. And as a consequence, each one was playing a different part. We are today much more integrated as a company working together in a much better place, which gives us chances to do what I just mentioned. It's obvious we just had not done it yet.",
			"Lunchables, you recently saw us launching Lunchables now in schools. Food service is a huge market. Schools is an untapped market for us. And although our Lunchables business is based on kids, it's $1.2 billion brand that moms give to kids to go to school. But we never sold in schools.",
			"And to sell in schools, we had to adapt to make Lunchables more nutritious, and that's what we just did. So we are going to have a much bigger reach, a much bigger distribution of Lunchables. And I could talk to you about innovation that we are preparing for Lunchables as well, but that would take a while.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> I'm sure. So what I'm hearing from you is a reinvention of some of these storied brands, Miguel. I believe now you're on track to save $2 and 1/2 billion in costs by 2027, lots of good things going on at the company. And as I think about-- right now I'm in Omaha getting ready for Warren Buffett's annual meeting, of course, he remains a very significant shareholder in your company.",
			"He has been critical of Kraft Heinz the past few years. But I'm hearing a turnaround story. What is your interaction been with Greg Abel, who might be the successor to Warren Buffett and who's on your board? What has he had to tell you of late?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">MIGUEL PATRICIO:</span> Yeah, so Greg is one of our most important board members. Berkshire has about close to 28% of our company of the shares of Kraft Heinz. They have three chairs in the board. And the good thing is that we get along very well. Some of the values of Berkshire are exactly the same as some of our values. They are very simple people, very straightforward, no egos as we are and as I like my people to be.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> All right, there you have Kraft Heinz CEO Miguel Patricio, Julie Hyman, talking about the innovative product coming up and that is frozen Mac &amp; Cheese. Having said all of that, as you can see, and I didn't oversell this despite the overture by my producer off-camera, Kevin, you can see the crowds really coming in here. A lot of folks we have started to talk to are from Brazil, China, England lining up to get that real insider access to Warren Buffett tomorrow.",
			"But as for today, they're going to get in there around noon, walk around all things Warren Buffett palooza, that is, whether it's Borsheims Exhibitions, or his See's Candies, Dairy Queen dilly bars, you name it. That is everything they're lining up to see and just get a taste of all things Warren Buffett. Unfortunately, guys, no frozen Mac &amp; cheese from Kraft Heinz. Maybe there is, but I'm betting there won't be.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JULIE HYMAN:</span> I hope that you microwave it before you eat it.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRAD SMITH:</span> Just a little bit. Heat it out.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">BRIAN SOZZI:</span> No comment, Julie.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">JULIE HYMAN:</span> Sounds like you got a week and a healthy eating ahead of you, Soz. Enjoy it."

			"Like Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Target also sells a variety of merchandise, including home goods, electronics, furniture and decor. It even has children’s apparel, shoes, toys and accessories — much like buybuy BABY. “Personally, I like shopping for home goods at Target, which is the nation’s 7th largest retailer by sales,” added Stearn.",

			"If you’re a Costco member — or even if you’re not but are thinking about becoming one — this big box store is a great place to get whatever you need for your home. Costco is known for selling items in bulk, which is convenient for families who need larger quantities for their household. But the retailer has more than that.",
			"At Costco, you can buy indoor and outdoor furniture and appliances, electronics, food, cleaning supplies and other household essentials.

			"Since it was founded in 1962, Walmart has long been known for its reasonable prices and large variety of goods. In fact, the man who founded the store, Sam Walton, did so with the goal of helping people save money on the things they need in their lives.",
			"“Walmart is the biggest retailer in the US, doing about $460 billion in sales a year,” said Stearn. They also have a global reach with more than 11,500 stores worldwide. Walmart also has online shopping and curbside pickup for those who prefer a less hands-on experience.",
			"Not only is Walmart a more affordable alternative to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, but it also has nearly anything you could need — for a fraction of the cost. This includes apparel, shoes, books, electronics, kitchenware, toys, video games, art supplies, auto parts, patio furniture, garden supplies and other household items.",
			"HomeGoods started out as a small chain in the early 1990s. Since then, hundreds of locations have opened up throughout the country. In 2021, HomeGoods also launched its own online shopping feature for people who prefer shopping from the comfort of home.",

			"Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.",
			"Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.",
			"<b>2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist</b>",
			"The Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.",
			"The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. <b>Coty (COTY)</b> earns a Zacks Rank #2 four days from its next quarterly earnings release on May 9, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.07 a share.",
			"COTY has an Earnings ESP figure of 60.97%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.07 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.05.",
			"COTY is one of just a large database of Consumer Staples stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is <b>Colgate-Palmolive (CL)</b>.",
			"Colgate-Palmolive, which is readying to report earnings on August 4, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.75 a share, and CL is 91 days out from its next earnings report.",
			"For Colgate-Palmolive, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.74 is 0.3%.",
			"Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, COTY and CL could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.",

			"<b>Philip Morris</b> (PM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.",
			"Over the past month, shares of this seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands have returned -4.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Tobacco industry, which Philip Morris falls in, has lost 0.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?",
			"While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.",
			"<b>Earnings Estimate Revisions</b>",
			"Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.",
			"Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.",
			"Philip Morris is expected to post earnings of $1.48 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.5%.",
			"For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.20 points to a change of +3.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.8%.",
			"For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.75 indicates a change of +8.8% from what Philip Morris is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.3%.",
			"With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Philip Morris.",
			"The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:",
			"<b>12 Month EPS</b>",
			"<b>Projected Revenue Growth</b>",
			"Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.",
			"For Philip Morris, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.53 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +8.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $34.52 billion and $36.35 billion estimates indicate +8.7% and +5.3% changes, respectively.",
			"<b>Last Reported Results and Surprise History</b>",
			"Philip Morris reported revenues of $8.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.6%. EPS of $1.38 for the same period compares with $1.56 a year ago.",
			"Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.08 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.3%. The EPS surprise was +3.76%.",
			"The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.",
			"<b>Valuation</b>",
			"No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.",
			"While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.",
			"As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.",
			"Philip Morris is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.",
			"<b>Bottom Line</b>",
			"The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Philip Morris. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.",

			"There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing <em>return</em> on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing <em>amount</em> of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think <strong>Coca-Cola</strong> (<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:NYSE:KO;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-ko/coca-cola?blueprint=2495181&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=intro&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NYSE:KO</a>) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.",
			"For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Coca-Cola:",
			"<strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong>",
			"0.17 = US$12b ÷ (US$97b - US$23b) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023)</em>.",
			"Therefore, <strong>Coca-Cola has an ROCE of 17%.</strong> In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Beverage industry average of 15%.",
			"<span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-ko/coca-cola?blueprint=2495181&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola </a></span>",
			"In the above chart we have measured Coca-Cola's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important.

			"Things have been pretty stable at Coca-Cola, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect Coca-Cola to be a multi-bagger going forward. That being the case, it makes sense that Coca-Cola has been paying out 67% of its earnings to its shareholders. These mature businesses typically have reliable earnings and not many places to reinvest them, so the next best option is to put the earnings into shareholders pockets.",
			"In summary, Coca-Cola isn't compounding its earnings but is generating stable returns on the same amount of capital employed. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 77% over the last five years. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.",

Revenues were US$6.5b, approximately in line with expectations, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) performed substantially better. EPS of US$0.68 were also better than expected, beating analyst predictions by 13%. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year.",

			"Taking into account the latest results, Kraft Heinz's 16 analysts currently expect revenues in 2023 to be US$27.3b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to surge 44% to US$2.85. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$27.0b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$2.72 in 2023. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.",
			"The consensus price target was unchanged at US$45.84, implying that the improved earnings outlook is not expected to have a long term impact on value creation for shareholders. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. The most optimistic Kraft Heinz analyst has a price target of US$52.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$41.00. The narrow spread of estimates could suggest that the business' future is relatively easy to value, or thatthe analysts have a strong view on its prospects.",
			"Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:industry;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/markets/us/consumer-staples/food?blueprint=2494691&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=industry&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a> growth estimates. It's clear from the latest estimates that Kraft Heinz's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 1.6% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2023 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 0.3% p.a. over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 2.9% per year. It seems obvious that, while the future growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, Kraft Heinz is expected to grow slower than the wider industry.",
			"The biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Kraft Heinz's earnings potential next year. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply revenues will perform worse than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$45.84, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.",
			"With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Kraft Heinz. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.

The company is poised to benefit in the long run from rapid growth in global population as well as the rising worldwide infrastructure needs.<br/><br/>(You can <strong>read the full research report on Deere here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br/><br/>Shares of <strong>Marsh &amp; McLennan</strong> have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry over the past six months (+10.7% vs. +7.7%). The company is well-poised to grow on the back of acquisitions made within its operating units, the launch of new products and branching out into new businesses. Its increased stake in Marsh India will further buoy growth.<br/><br/>Revenues have been increasing thanks to a wide geographic presence and strong client retention. The Zacks analyst expects the top line to grow 4.6% year over year in 2023. The Risk and Insurance Services unit has been contributing to revenue growth for a while. MMC had around $4 billion left under authorization as of Mar 31, 2023.<br/><br/>However, high operating costs might weigh on the margins. A debt-laden balance sheet is a concern. Its valuation remains stretched at the current level. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.<br/><br/>(You can <strong>read the full research report on Marsh &amp; McLennan here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br/><br/>Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Uber Technologies, Inc. and Colgate-Palmolive Co.",

			"Three Dividend Aristocrats –<strong> W.W. Grainger</strong>, <strong>Procter &amp; Gamble </strong>and <strong>McDonald’s</strong> – are all examples of companies that have stood the test of time.",
			"And while these investments are typically labeled as ‘boring,’ their stability is undeniable. Below is a chart illustrating the total return performance of all three stocks above over the last five years, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.",
			"Perhaps to the surprise of some, all three have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in this more extended timeframe, which doesn’t sound very ‘boring’ to me.",
			"<strong>Procter &amp; Gamble</strong>",
			"Consumer Staples titan Procter &amp; Gamble posted better-than-expected results and provided optimistic guidance in its latest release, helping shares close 3.5% higher post-earnings. Earnings improved 3% year-over-year, whereas revenue saw growth of 4%.",
			"The company’s revenue growth has been steady over the last five years.",
			"PG’s annual dividend currently yields 2.4%, below the Zacks Consumer Staples sector average modestly. In addition, the company’s 6.3% five-year annualized dividend growth rate is undoubtedly a major positive.",
			"Shares are a bit expensive at the moment, with the current 26.7X forward earnings multiple well above the 24.1X five-year median.",
			"PG currently carries a Style Score of “D” for Value.",
			"<strong>W.W. Grainger</strong>",
			"Analysts have raised their earnings expectations across all timeframes for GWW over the last several months, pushing the stock into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).",
			"The company’s dividend presently yields a respectable 1% annually, with a payout ratio sitting sustainably at 21% of its earnings. The company has shown a commitment to increasingly rewarding its shareholders.",
			"On top of a shareholder-friendly nature, W.W. Grainger’s growth projections are solid, with earnings forecasted to climb 18% in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 6% in FY24.",
			"<strong>McDonald’s</strong>",
			"McDonald’s posted results that came in well above expectations in its latest print, delivering a positive 14% EPS surprise. Currently, the stock sports the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).",
			"MCD’s annual dividend currently yields 2.1%, nearly double that of the Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector average. Impressively, the company’s payout has grown by 10% just over the last year.",
			"For those seeking reliability, all three Dividend Aristocrats above could be considered.",

			"A big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Unilever was earning enough to cover the previous dividend, but it was paying out quite a large proportion of its free cash flows. The company is clearly earning enough to pay this type of dividend, but it is definitely focused on returning cash to shareholders, rather than growing the business.",
			"EPS is set to fall by 7.1% over the next 12 months. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 56%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.",
			"While the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. The annual payment during the last 10 years was €0.972 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was €1.66. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 5.5% per annum over that time. A reasonable rate of dividend growth is good to see, but we're wary that the dividend history is not as solid as we'd like, having been cut at least once.",
			"With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. We are encouraged to see that Unilever has grown earnings per share at 7.1% per year over the past five years. Earnings are on the uptrend, and it is only paying a small portion of those earnings to shareholders.",
			"In summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think Unilever's payments are rock solid. The low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, but generally we are not too happy with the payments Unilever has been making. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.",
			"It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

The type of consistency we crave in our dividends tends to be a cultural consistency and one that can be found throughout the years of various management at the firm. On the surface, we are looking for dividend stocks to buy. But in reality, we are looking for dividend aristocrats that can deliver across the board. That doesn’t mean simply paying out or raising a dividend. It also includes consistency with its business and the long-term returns generated for investors. Put simply, I want to own a business that can hold up to various fluctuations in the stock market, regardless of what’s going on. Let’s look at a few dividends for 2023.",

			"There’s one moment that really sticks with me and that was April 2020. The Covid-19 pandemic had exploded around the world and stocks were getting killed. It wasn’t odd to see the <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong> down 5%, 6%, 7%, or more — in a single session!",
			"Then <strong>Johnson &amp; Johnson</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:JNJ;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/jnj-stock-quote/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>JNJ</strong></a>) reported solid earnings, told a pretty reassuring tale, and raised its dividend. The stock jumped 4.5% the next day and the report kickstarted a 12.5% rally in the share price. What a way to reassure investors during a time of immense uncertainty. Fast-forward a few years and the firm recently <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:raised;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-dividend-increase-of-5-3#:~:text=New%20Brunswick%2C%20N.J.%20(April%2018,share%20to%20%241.19%20per%20share.\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">raised</a> its dividend for the 61st consecutive year. While it pays just a 2.9% dividend yield, it’s one of the most dependable yields in the market. Then consider J&amp;J’s other attributes and it becomes very difficult to ignore.",

			"For instance, shares trade at roughly 15 times this year’s earnings estimates, while analysts expect mid-single-digit earnings and revenue growth. That’s a rather low valuation and even if the growth rate isn’t robust, growth is growth and in a tough environment, that’s all we can ask for.",
			"Source: Shutterstock",
			"Want something with a little bit more growth? Try out <strong>PepsiCo</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:PEP;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/pep-stock-quote/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>PEP</strong></a>), a name every investor knows. This stock has quietly rallied to all-time highs and given the uncertain investing environment, it’s no surprise that investors are piling into names with predictable earnings and dependable cash flow.",
			"Think about it. PepsiCo not only dominates the beverage space with brands like Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Tropicana, OceanSpray, and others, but it also dominates snack brands too, owning Tostitos, Ruffles, Rold Gold, Lay’s, Cheetos, Doritos and <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:plenty of others;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.pepsico.com/our-brands/creating-smiles/our-products\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">plenty of others</a>. Put simply, PepsiCo dominates the food and beverages aisles at the grocery store. In good times and bad, there will be demand for its products — and so far, demand has remained pretty strong.",
			"The company <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:recently beat;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3959537-pepsico-non-gaap-eps-of-1_50-beats-0_11-revenue-of-17_85b-beats-580m\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recently beat</a> earnings and revenue expectations and gave a slight boost to its organic growth expectations. Further, PepsiCo <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:upped;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pepsico-declares-quarterly-dividend-301813765.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">upped</a> its dividend by 10%. While it yields “just” 2.65%, the firm has now raised its payout in 51 consecutive years. So regardless of what the stock market does, it’s clear that PepsiCo is one of the best dividend stocks out there.",
			"Source: Shutterstock",
			"A list of dividend stocks to buy in any environment could be pretty long.

Ultimately I went with the latter, but there is a pretty big caveat to mention.",
			"This is not a stock for short-term investors. Further, Realty Income — or O stock for short — is one of the few stocks out there that hasn’t gone on to make new highs since the Covid-19 selloff. Conversely, P&amp;G has roared to 52-week highs in recent trading. Despite the rally, P&amp;G trades at roughly 26 times earnings with a nearly non-existent growth forecast for this year. That’s okay for some investors, as P&amp;G is a dividend stud. However, Realty Income shouldn’t be ignored either.",
			"Although there is the commercial real estate risk that could weigh on REITs — that being the “caveat” I mentioned a moment ago — Realty Income is really impressive when it comes to long-term investors buying, holding, and dripping the dividend. Shares yield just over 5%, the highest on this list, while the company pays its dividend monthly, not quarterly. Lastly, it has <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:raised;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.realtyincome.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">raised</a> its dividend in 102 consecutive quarters (or more than 25 years) and has paid its monthly dividend consecutively for more than 52 years!",

			"A holding company — usually a corporation or LLC — is created for the primary business of holding a controlling interest in the securities of other companies. Oftentimes known as parent companies, holding companies are quite common <a class=\"link yahoo-link\" data-ylk=\"slk:around the world;elm:context_link;itc:0;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-holding-companies-world-180637937.html\">around the world</a>, especially when it comes to large firms operating in lucrative industries such as finance and consumer goods.",
			"Somewhat similar to hedge funds, mutual funds, and investors in that they can hold an interest in certain firms, what sets holding companies apart is that they hold a controlling stake within a company that provides them with the ability to decide management and set long-term strategic goals for the target firm. This, in turn, allows a holding company to be entitled to the profits of its subsidiaries.",
			"There are certain advantages that come with a holding company, including liability protection. Since they are relatively easy to create or change, holding companies can take advantage of geographical differences in taxation regimes. If a location has high tax taxes, the holding company can simply relocate to a more business-friendly environment while continuing operations in the original area of operation.",
			"While the picture seems rosy for holding companies, the same isn't guaranteed for their subsidiaries. As an example, a subsidiary cannot raise capital by issuing new shares, and it is also at risk if the parent runs into legal troubles. Additionally, if a subsidiary company goes bankrupt, the holding company may experience a capital loss and a decline in net worth. That said, the bankrupt company’s creditors cannot legally pursue the holding company for remuneration.",
			"With these details in mind, it is time to take a look at some of the biggest holding companies in the USA.

As a result, these alternative alcoholic beverages gained market share. In many markets, still wine became a popular choice for \"at-home\" consumption during lockdowns, while RTDs and spirits capitalized on the growing trend of cocktails worldwide.

			"<span class=\"speaker\">AKIKO FUJITA:</span> Well, Johnson &amp; Johnson's consumer health spin-off, Kenvue, is officially going public on the New York Stock Exchange today. Kenvue will now be the company behind brands like Tylenol, Band-Aid, and Listerine. Trading under the ticker, KVUE, shares were priced at $22 a share. And now you're seeing it up about 20% almost here on its initial day.",
			"It is the biggest IPO in more than a year and we've got Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with Kenvue's CEO. Anjalee.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">ANJALEE KHEMLANI:</span> That's right, Akiko. I have here with me Thibaut Mongon, who used to head J&amp;J's consumer segment and is now sliding into the CEO position of Kenvue. Thibaut, thank you so much for joining us today. Obviously, a really lovely start for you for the stock. More than you expected, I imagine?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">THIBAUT MONGON:</span> No. Thank you for having me. We are very excited. Today is a great day. We just listed Kenvue view for the first time, bringing it to life as the world's largest pure-play consumer health company. $15 billion in revenue, presence in 165 countries. So today millions of consumers have in their house Kenvue brand.",
			"Think about Tylenol, Neutrogena, Band-Aid, Listerine, Aveeno. These are brands that have been with consumers for decades and sometimes for generations. And we are happy to bring Kenvue to the world today and make sure that we are excited about today, but also what lies ahead.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">ANJALEE KHEMLANI:</span> Absolutely. To your point, brands that people know very well. The company already valued close to $50 billion based on the IPO right now, largest this year. Really good start for the brand, but talk to me about separating from that legacy J&amp;J brand, which is what these consumers know, and about how Kenvue now fits in this new consumer health market.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">THIBAUT MONGON:</span> Yeah, we do this from a position of strength. Kenvue have strong leadership positions across the different categories where we play. We are the only company our size covering all aspects of consumer health, self-care, skin health, essential health. But with the depth and expertise that we have because we have been in this space for 135 years. So that's what really makes Kenvue unique and that's what makes us very confident in our ability to thrive as a publicly traded company.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">ANJALEE KHEMLANI:</span> How does it fit into the broader market? We know that GSK, for example, spun-off Haleon. And so there's examples of this, and they've been performing pretty strongly as well quarter-over-quarter. How do you think about investment, innovation, and the like when it comes to Kenvue moving forward?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">THIBAUT MONGON:</span> Yeah, we are very pleased with the portfolio we have. We are very well positioned in the categories where we play, but also the unique portfolio of iconic brands we have at Kenvue, and we see ample opportunity for our brands to continue to grow, to continue to innovate, so we can bring to consumers a product and solution they need to take better health-- better care of their health. And that's really our mission at Kenvue.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">ANJALEE KHEMLANI:</span> Almost like you're separating from the company. You're like a 16-year-old being given the keys to the car and you get to just take off, right?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">THIBAUT MONGON:</span> Yeah, a 135-year-old 16-year-old. Yes, we are going to be more focused with more agility. Really being able to focus on our mission to be close to our consumers and understand how we can innovate to better serve their needs.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">ANJALEE KHEMLANI:</span> And I know this is just a starting off point. You obviously have build out. J&amp;J still holding a majority stake in the company for the rest of the year. You're also building out a new space, a new headquarters. But in terms of looking at old J&amp;J, there's also the talc situation, the litigation there.",
			"You have the product coming under this new consumer brand, but you are indemnified against the case. Talk to me about the baby powder and baby products moving forward and the plans for them.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">THIBAUT MONGON:</span> Yeah. Let me be very clear. The liability in the US and Canada stays with J&amp;J. So at Kenvue we are laser-focused on what we do best, building brands that have strong trust and leadership position with consumers. That's why we are focused on right now and we continue to evolve our portfolio to more natural, sustainable solutions. And that's what we will continue doing moving forward.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">ANJALEE KHEMLANI:</span> Tell me about the read on the market for consumers. What is it that you think they're looking for when it comes to the outlook of the brand development of what types of products you're looking to introduce. Anything new on the horizon?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">THIBAUT MONGON:</span> Yeah. There is no limit for you to take care of your own health and there is no limit for Kenvue to invent products and solutions that allow you to do that. So it is summer is coming. So if you take sunscreen, as an example, unfortunately, millions of Americans do not use sunscreen on a regular basis today.",
			"So that's something that we look at at Kenvue. Our Neutrogena teams did step up and launch innovation with a new product. Neutrogena Invisible Defense that doesn't leave any residue on your skin, whatever your skin tone. And so that's going to be a great new reason for Americans to reconsider sunscreen and have a great summer thanks to Neutrogena.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">ANJALEE KHEMLANI:</span> I may or may not be one of those people that skips out on sunscreen sometimes. OK. So final question for you. Going forward, you taking over at the helm of the company, is this a long-term takeover for you? Do you imagine you're going to be with the company for quite some time? Because you've already been with legacy J&amp;J.",
			"You've overseen the growth of the consumer business through the pandemic and everything. How do you feel about going forward?",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">THIBAUT MONGON:</span> Well, very excited today, but also about the future what lies ahead for me, but also for the 22,000 team members who around the world work every single day to make sure that they help consumers realize the extraordinary power of everyday care. That brings them products and solutions that are grounded in science.",
			"And those by doctors, health care professionals helping them take better care of their health. That's what we are focused on in Kenvue and we are very excited about it.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">ANJALEE KHEMLANI:</span> Love it. Well, Thibaut Mongon, new CEO of Kenvue. Congratulations on the IPO today. Seana, back to you.",
			"<span class=\"speaker\">SEANA SMITH:</span> Great stuff, Anjalee. Great interview. Thanks so much. Kenvue shares up 20% today in their public debut."

Granted, they're about $15 upfront, which is about what you'd pay for that giant 12-pack at Costco, but they're still going strong after a half year of use.\"",
			"Where there is food being made, messes are sure to follow. However, if you think throwing some cleaning supplies in your grocery cart is the cheapest option, think again.",
			"\"When it comes to cleaning supplies, you're often paying for the packaging as much as the product itself,\" Schuering said. \"Switching to an all-purpose cleaning concentrate (like Dr. Bronner's Sal Suds) from Amazon yields dozens of bottles of cleaner for just $11.\"",

			"\"Secondly, always shop in bulk. Costco used to be my go-to spot for TP, but now we use Grove's bamboo TP to be a bit more environmentally friendly. Eight giant rolls cost just $8.99 and last our two-person WFH household more than a month.\"",
			"Just when you think your shelves are stocked with tupperware, you notice they've gone missing. Don't go to the grocery store to restock because there is a better, cheaper route.",
			"\"The food storage at grocery stores is usually pretty flimsy, plus the lids and bases are all different shapes and sizes, so keeping them organized is a pain,\" Schuering pointed out. \"Spend a little more upfront to buy sturdier versions (like Snapware) on Amazon.",
			"\"Alternatively, if you like the [deli containers] from takeout, you can get them super cheap on Amazon or Webstaurant Store,\" Schuering recommended. \"As an extra benefit of going [that] route, all the bases are stackable, and all the lids are the same size. Bonus points if you install a browser plug-in to track prices and alert you when your dream set goes on sale.\"",
			"Sending the kids off to school with their lunch ensures that they have healthy options to eat when they get hungry. Just don't expect those zip-top bags to come home and when they don't, stay away from buying more at the grocery store.",
			"\"Getting reusable sandwich, snack and gallon bags will save you a boatload in the long term,\" Schuering said. \"I like the ones from Grove because they're affordable but durable and easy to zip.

			"\"Costco comes to the rescue again,\" Schuering said. \"We buy 200 trash bags at a time for just $13. Since we recycle and compost regularly, the giant box we have now has literally lasted us since the beginning of 2021.\"",
			"As spring kicks off, you might think about growing your own garden this year. However, stay away from any plant food you might pick up with your groceries.",
			"\"While you can often score great deals on inexpensive plants at certain grocery stores, hold off on buying the plant food,\" Schuering recommended. \"Not only is synthetic fertilizer like Miracle Grow not as good for your plants and possibly toxic to humans, it's also way marked up at the grocery store. Do yourself a favor and go to a nursery or farming co-op to get better quality plant food for less.\"",
			"You don't want to strategize when and where you might need to buy feminine products or diapers, especially in an emergency. Luckily, Schuering has a few places you can stock up that aren't necessarily the grocery store.",
			"\"Costco, Target and Amazon generally offer more brands (many of which are organic) for much less than you'd pay at Kroger,\" noted Schuering. \"Grove is also a great option.\"",
			"Another tip is to stay on the lookout for coupons or sales on well-known diaper brands like Huggies and Pampers. Try signing up for loyalty reward programs with those brands or join Amazon Family, which offers up to 20% off with a diaper subscription.",

			"When you search for an item on Amazon, you don't always see the best price for it on the main product page.

			"You can even save 5% at any in-store Starbucks location when you use your RedCard, Gramuglia said.",
			"\"If you haven't already, download the Target app to gain exclusive access to deals and coupons, browse weekly ads and place orders with Drive Up,\" Gramuglia said. \"It's easier than ever to use coupons to save money and time when shopping through the Target app.\"",

Look for stackable coupons on Target.com, your local circular and on a deal site like Slickdeals.net, which has a page dedicated to Target coupons.\"",
			"You can sometimes save money by abandoning your online shopping cart.",
			"\"Stores like Target track our every move while browsing the internet, so when we leave a store's page without making a purchase, they take note of it,\" Gramuglia said. \"If you wait a few days or so, you may receive a 'We miss you!' or 'You forgot something!' email from that store featuring a product you clicked on but didn't buy, and sometimes a customized discount code, too.\"",
			"There's no one clearance section at Target, so it's important to not overlook the clearance areas in the respective sections of the store.",

			"\"Target is one of those stores that's really easy to walk out of with more than you intended -- there's even a term for it: the 'Target Effect,'\" Ramhold said. \"A good way to combat this is to plan your trips in minute detail. It sounds overwhelming, but the app can make things much easier as it has a map function so you can pinpoint where the items on your list are. Make your list in the app, note where each item is, and then stick to that list to keep from walking out with five new throw pillows you don't have room for.\"",
			"Not everything on the Target app and site is available for in-store pickup, but if you only need a few things and they are available for pickup or drive up, consider using this functionality.",
			"\"If you opt for store pickup, you'll go inside and go straight to the service desk to pick up your order when it's ready, and if you opt for drive-up service, they'll bring your order out to you,\" Ramhold said. \"This means you won't even have a chance to be enticed by the cute and useful things in the Dollar Spot, or the selection of snacks up front.\"",
			"Walmart is known for its 'everyday low prices' -- but you still might be spending more than you need to be if you're making these common Walmart shopping mistakes.",
			"Like Amazon, Walmart.com sells items from third-party sellers.",
			"\"Before you buy something on Walmart.com, do a Google search to see if you are getting the lowest price,\" Gramuglia said. \"For example, a pair of Nike sneakers from a third-party seller on Walmart ranges from $89.22 to $98.52, whereas you can buy the exact same shoe at Dick's Sporting Goods for $54.99. Keep in mind that Walmart does not price match for third-party sellers, so comparing prices prior to purchasing is a must.\"",
			"\"Walmart is known for its prices, but whether you are shopping something full-price or on sale at a Rollback price, be sure to always comparison shop to make sure you're actually getting the best deal,\" Gramuglia said. \"Walmart does price-match, but it needs to be the exact item and must apply to other limitations the store sets.\"",
			"You should also take quality into consideration before making a purchase.",
			"\"If you find yourself eyeing a product, like a sweater for $10, consider the quality, style, and longevity and usage of the product,\" Gramuglia said. \"Sometimes inexpensive products end up costing you more in replacing the item than it would if you bought a better quality product. However, you can also find quality products at a lower price, so be sure to weigh the pros and cons to make the best decision for your finances.\"",

			"\"You may find a clearance item or full-priced item that you've been eyeing, but may want to put it back on the shelf because it's out of your budget. But before you do that, double-check the price,\" Gramuglia said. \"Especially since items can be easily moved throughout the large store, always price check your items for a final verdict. Stores like Walmart are constantly running promotions and have items marked down, and may be running a deal that you don't know about that can save you an extra few bucks. The price scanner will give you the most up-to-date cost.\"",
			"The early bird gets the best deals at Walmart.",
			"\"Making the trip before 9 a.m. is a good idea since that is when everything has been neatly restocked and you have a better chance of getting what you want,\" said Freya Kuka, founder of the personal finance blog <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Collecting Cents;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://collectingcents.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Collecting Cents</a>. \"If you are a morning person, this is a great way to start the day.\"",
			"\"Walmart has 'Great Value' options that are branded replacements; [opting for these] can help you save hundreds every month,\" Kuka said. \"In most cases, the brand is nothing but a name in comparison.\"",
			"\"Usually a month before the next major holiday rolls around, Walmart devotes at least one entire aisle to items for it. And yes, it can be tempting to grab a giant bag of Halloween-themed chocolate in mid-September, but if you wait until the day after the holiday, you'll see incredible discounts that make it so much easier to get a bigger bang for your buck,\" Ramhold said. \"Granted, for things like that, you might need themed candies and items before the holiday itself, but we recommend getting only what you need ahead of time, and then treating yourself to goodies the day after the holiday.\"",
			"\"Rollback prices typically last around 90 days, but they aren't actually sale or clearance prices -- they're just a slight price drop due to something like overstock,\" Ramhold said.",

Meanwhile, revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate. Earnings and sales improved year over year.<br/><br/>Top and bottom-line growth reflected continued business momentum, owing to relentless execution, investment in its brands and accelerated digital transformation. Results also benefited from continued consumer demand for its brand portfolio.

The company registered organic revenue growth of 13.2%, primarily driven by robust revenue per hectoliter (hl) growth. The top line benefited from pricing actions, continued premiumization and other revenue management initiatives.

The total organic volume rose 0.9%, with a 0.4% increase in the own-beer volume and 3.6% growth in the non-beer volume.<br/><br/>AB InBev has been keen on making the most of investments in its portfolio over the years, as well as rapidly growing its digital platform, including BEES and Zé Delivery. The company’s digital transformation initiatives have been on track, with B2B digital platforms contributing about 62% of its revenues in the first quarter. The company noted that the monthly active user base of BEES reached 3.1 million users as of Mar 31, 2023. Its direct-to-consumer ecosystem generated more than $100 million in revenues in first-quarter 2023, reflecting low-teens growth year over year.<br/><br/>The company has been focused on expanding its Beyond Beer portfolio, which has also been aiding the top line. Notably, the Beyond Beer portfolio contributed more than $325 million to the total revenues in first-quarter 2023.<br/><br/>The cost of sales increased 8.8% on a reported basis and 14% on an organic basis to $6,517 million in the first quarter.<br/><br/>The company’s normalized earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were $4,759 million, which rose 6.1% year over year and 13.6% on an organic basis. The increase was driven by disciplined resource allocation and overhead expense management. The normalized EBITDA margin contracted 40 basis points (bps) to 33.5% but expanded 13 bps organically.<br/><br/>SG&amp;A expenses rose 5.5% year over year to $4,344 million and increased 10.3% on an organic basis. Higher SG&amp;A expenses can be attributed to elevated supply-chain costs.",
			"For 2023, AB InBev expects year over year EBITDA growth of 4-8%, in line with its medium-term outlook. It anticipates revenue growth to be higher than EBITDA growth, driven by strong volume and pricing.<br/><br/>The company expects net pension interest expenses and accretion expenses of $200-$230 million, based on currency and interest rate fluctuations. It anticipates an average gross debt coupon of 4% for 2023.<br/><br/>Management anticipates a normalized effective tax rate of 27-29% for 2023.

			"<b>Freeport-McMoRan</b> (FCX) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.",
			"Over the past month, shares of this mining company have returned -8.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, which Freeport-McMoRan falls in, has lost 1.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?",
			"While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.",
			"<b>Earnings Estimate Revisions</b>",
			"Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.",
			"Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.",
			"Freeport-McMoRan is expected to post earnings of $0.50 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -13.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.1%.",
			"The consensus earnings estimate of $2.06 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -15.6%. This estimate has changed +2.2% over the last 30 days.",
			"For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.30 indicates a change of +11.8% from what Freeport-McMoRan is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.7%.",
			"With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Freeport-McMoRan.",
			"The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:",
			"<b>12 Month EPS</b>",
			"<b>Projected Revenue Growth</b>",
			"While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.",
			"In the case of Freeport-McMoRan, the consensus sales estimate of $5.99 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.6%. The $23.91 billion and $24.14 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +5% and +1%, respectively.",
			"<b>Last Reported Results and Surprise History</b>",
			"Freeport-McMoRan reported revenues of $5.39 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -18.4%. EPS of $0.52 for the same period compares with $1.07 a year ago.",
			"Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.07%. The EPS surprise was +10.64%.",
			"Over the last four quarters, Freeport-McMoRan surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.",
			"<b>Valuation</b>",
			"No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.",
			"Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.",
			"The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.",
			"Freeport-McMoRan is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.",
			"<b>Bottom Line</b>",
			"The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Freeport-McMoRan. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.",

			"Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.",
			"Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Air Products and Chemicals: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.",

In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Chemical - Diversified is currently in the bottom 27% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

After strong steel production during the first quarter, the optimism and activity that followed the end of lockdown have waned, leading to a “collapse” in the steel market and raising questions about the durability of the Chinese economic recovery. The price of iron delivered into the northern Chinese port of Qingdao fell to $102.7 last week, down 23 per cent from its recent high in March, recovering slightly to $107.9 at Monday’s close."

It posted a negative earnings surprise of 23.2% in the last reported quarter. The company’s first-quarter performance will likely reflect the benefits of healthy demand for fertilizers.

			"NTR is likely to have benefited from solid demand for fertilizers in the March quarter, backed by the strength in the global agricultural market. It is expected to have gained from healthy potash volumes on the back of high domestic and overseas demand and actions to boost potash production. Nutrien is also likely to have gained from acquisitions, cost efficiency and increased adoption of its digital platform.<br/><br/>However, the company is likely to have faced headwinds from higher natural gas prices. Natural gas is a major component in nitrogen production costs. Nutrien is seeing a rise in the cost of goods sold per ton for nitrogen due to higher natural gas costs. It is also facing headwinds from elevated raw material costs. Higher gas and input costs might have impacted the company’s margins in the March quarter.<br/><br/>Moreover, prices of phosphate and potash retreated in the back half of 2022 from their peak levels attained in the first half riding on the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war and disruptions due to the sanctions in Belarus. Global nitrogen prices have declined since the beginning of 2023. Lower fertilizer prices are expected to have weighed on the company’s profitability in the first quarter.",

It is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to predict the timing or occurrence of these events or the potential for other transactions that may impact future GAAP EPS. Similarly, it is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to reconcile the forecasted capital expenditures to future cash used for investing activities because management is not able to identify the timing or occurrence of future investment activity, which is driven by management's assessment of competing opportunities at the time the Company enters into transactions.

On a consolidated basis, these measures include adjusted diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\"), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, and capital expenditures. On a segment basis, these measures include adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. In addition to these measures, we also present certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to help the reader understand the impact that certain disclosed items, or \"non-GAAP adjustments,\" have on the calculation of our adjusted diluted EPS. For each non-GAAP financial measure, we present a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.",
			"In many cases, non-GAAP financial measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable GAAP measure to exclude non-GAAP adjustments that we believe are not representative of our underlying business performance. For example, we exclude the impact of the non-service components of net periodic benefit/cost for our defined benefit pension plans as further discussed below. Additionally, we may exclude certain expenses associated with cost reduction actions, impairment charges, and gains on disclosed transactions. The reader should be aware that we may recognize similar losses or gains in the future.",
			"When applicable, the tax impact of our pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax impact of our non-GAAP adjustments. These tax impacts are primarily driven by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions.",
			"We provide these non-GAAP financial measures to allow investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others to evaluate the performance of our business in the same manner as our management. We believe these measures, when viewed together with financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results. However, we caution readers not to consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Readers should also consider the limitations associated with these non-GAAP financial measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another.",

Non-service related components are recurring, non-operating items that include interest cost, expected returns on plan assets, prior service cost amortization, actuarial loss amortization, as well as special termination benefits, curtailments, and settlements. The net impact of non-service related components is reflected within \"Other non-operating income (expense), net\" on our consolidated income statements. Adjusting for the impact of non-service pension components provides management and users of our financial statements with a more accurate representation of our underlying business performance because these components are driven by factors that are unrelated to our operations, such as recent changes to the allocation of our pension plan assets associated with de-risking as well as volatility in equity and debt markets.

			"So, based on the above formula, the ROE for BHP Group is:",
			"43% = US$20b ÷ US$47b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).",
			"The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every A$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated A$0.43 in profit.",
			"We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.",
			"To begin with, BHP Group has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 16% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Under the circumstances, BHP Group's considerable five year net income growth of 25% was to be expected.",
			"As a next step, we compared BHP Group's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 29% in the same period.",
			"Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:check if BHP Group is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/materials/asx-bhp/bhp-group-shares/valuation?blueprint=2500772&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=conclusion&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">check if BHP Group is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E</a>, relative to its industry.",
			"The high three-year median payout ratio of 92% (implying that it keeps only 7.6% of profits) for BHP Group suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of the earnings to its shareholders.",
			"Moreover, BHP Group is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 65% over the next three years. Still forecasts suggest that BHP Group's future ROE will drop to 21% even though the the company's payout ratio is expected to decrease. This suggests that there could be other factors could driving the anticipated decline in the company's ROE.",
			"In total, it does look like BHP Group has some positive aspects to its business. Namely, its high earnings growth, which was likely due to its high ROE. However, investors could have benefitted even more from the high ROE, had the company been reinvesting more of its earnings. As discussed earlier, the company is retaining hardly any of its profits. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

			"MELBOURNE, Australia, May 08, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In a first for the mining industry, BHP has published a pilot case study on the application of natural capital accounting principles in the mining sector.<br/>",
			"The ‘Natural Capital Accounting for the Mining Sector: Beenup Site Pilot Case Study’ (Beenup Case Study), based on a case study at BHP’s closed and rehabilitated Beenup Mineral Sands site in southern Western Australia, is the first attempt at trialling natural capital accounting within the mining industry.",
			"Natural capital accounts are a way to measure the amount, condition and value of environmental assets, helping to describe changes in ecosystems and how they could impact wellbeing and economies.",
			"BHP Chief Legal, Governance and External Affairs Officer, Caroline Cox, said BHP’s aspiration is to contribute to ‘nature positive’ outcomes, with the goal of having at least 30 per cent of the land and water it stewards, approximately two million hectares, under conservation, restoration or regenerative practices by 2030.",
			"“We know that objectively measuring our progress and understanding the impacts of our efforts will only be possible using tools such as natural capital accounts. Our Beenup Case Study provides important insights, so we’re pleased to share it and engage with others on the development of natural capital accounting within the industry.”",
			"BHP Vice President Environment, Anne Dekker, said tools like natural capital accounting would enable better decision making for sectors of society who are working to halt and reverse current trends in nature loss by 2030.",
			"“When we look at the case study’s findings we see some expected outcomes from mine rehabilitation activities, such as increases in species and habitat, but also a couple of outcomes that were not part of the original rehabilitation design, such as a net gain in carbon storage and significant improvement in quality of water that flows through the site from local pastoral operations to environmental receptors and communities downstream.",
			"“So, the case study has really given us a foundation for considering how we can evolve natural capital accounting concepts for mine sites and sets us up to take the next steps, such as applying them at our operational sites and working with others to apply them within the industry more broadly.”",
			"BHP selected the closed and rehabilitated Beenup site for the pilot case study as it enabled retrospective tracking of different land use scenarios over a period of time, was supported by a rich knowledge bank and the rehabilitation planning had nature-positive outcomes as an early intent.",
			"<strong>Further information</strong>",
			"The Beenup Case Study was prepared by Syrinx Environmental for BHP and is a collaboration between BHP, CRC TiME, CSIRO, Curtin University, Syrinx Environmental, The University of Western Australia and the Western Australian Biodiversity Science Institute.

			"BHP owns, leases or manages an area at its operated assets of just under 6.5 million hectares (excluding greenfield exploration licence areas), with a mining operational disturbance footprint of just around two per cent of that area.

			"Cabot (CBT) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.33 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.28 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.69 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.",
			"This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.91%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this chemical company would post earnings of $0.96 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.98, delivering a surprise of 2.08%.",
			"Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.",
			"Cabot , which belongs to the Zacks Chemical - Diversified industry, posted revenues of $1.03 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.73%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.09 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.",
			"The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.",
			"Cabot shares have added about 6.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.7%.",
			"<b>What's Next for Cabot?</b>",
			"While Cabot has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?",
			"There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.",
			"Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.",
			"Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Cabot: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.",
			"It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.96 on $1.18 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.38 on $4.61 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.",
			"Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Chemical - Diversified is currently in the bottom 26% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.",
			"Another stock from the same industry, Air Products and Chemicals (APD), has yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2023. The results are expected to be released on May 9.",
			"This seller of gases for industrial, medical and other uses is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.64 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +10.9%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.",
			"Air Products and Chemicals' revenues are expected to be $3.02 billion, up 2.5% from the year-ago quarter.",

But that shouldn't obscure the pleasing returns achieved by shareholders over the last three years. After all, the share price is up a market-beating 80% in that time.",
			"While the stock has fallen 8.0% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals.",
			"<span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Check out our latest analysis for Nutrien;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-ntr/nutrien-shares?blueprint=2500169&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for Nutrien </a></span>",
			"There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).",
			"Nutrien was able to grow its EPS at 108% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 22% average annual increase in the share price. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 4.23 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.",
			"The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).",
			"It's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. This <strong>free</strong> interactive report on Nutrien's <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:earnings, revenue and cash flow;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-ntr/nutrien-shares/past?blueprint=2500169&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=integrated-pitch&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">earnings, revenue and cash flow</a> is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.",
			"As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Nutrien's TSR for the last 3 years was 97%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!",
			"Investors in Nutrien had a tough year, with a total loss of 26% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 0.04%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 10%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:2 warning signs for Nutrien;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/materials/tsx-ntr/nutrien-shares?blueprint=2500169&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=integrated-pitch&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>2 warning signs for Nutrien</strong></a> (1 is a bit concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here.",

			"<b>Nucor</b> (NUE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.",
			"Over the past month, shares of this steel company have returned -2.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Steel - Producers industry, which Nucor falls in, has lost 1.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?",
			"While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.",
			"<b>Earnings Estimate Revisions</b>",
			"Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.",
			"Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.",
			"For the current quarter, Nucor is expected to post earnings of $5.28 per share, indicating a change of -45.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +37.8% over the last 30 days.",
			"For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.57 points to a change of -42.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.7%.",
			"For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.46 indicates a change of -24.8% from what Nucor is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.9%.",
			"With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Nucor.",
			"The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:",
			"<b>12 Month EPS</b>",
			"<b>Projected Revenue Growth</b>",
			"While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.",
			"In the case of Nucor, the consensus sales estimate of $8.84 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -25.1%. The $36.03 billion and $32.82 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -13.2% and -8.9%, respectively.",
			"<b>Last Reported Results and Surprise History</b>",
			"Nucor reported revenues of $8.71 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -17%. EPS of $4.45 for the same period compares with $7.67 a year ago.",
			"Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.5 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.45%. The EPS surprise was +16.8%.",
			"The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.",
			"<b>Valuation</b>",
			"Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.",
			"While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.",
			"As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.",
			"Nucor is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.",
			"<b>Bottom Line</b>",
			"The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nucor. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.",

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for APD in this report.",
			"In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.70 per share for APD, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.64 per share.

			"A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).",

			"Dividend aristocrats are the companies in the S&amp;P 500 that have raised their dividends for 25 years or more. Value stocks trade at a lower price relative to their intrinsic value and typically have a lower price-to-earnings ratio. The concept of value investing, popularized by Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett, revolves around the belief that the market occasionally misprices stocks, leading to opportunities for seasoned investors to buy them at a discount. This investment strategy has proven to be successful over the long haul, delivering a total return of 1,344,600% since 1926, compared with a 626,000% return on growth stocks, as reported by <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Bank of America;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/value-vs-growth-stocks-performance/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bank of America</a>.",

The report mentioned that value stocks exceeded growth from January 1970 to February 2007 by 17 percentage points. During this period, inflation averaged 4.7%.",
			"Last year’s high inflation and consistent interest rate hikes also resulted in the dominance of value stocks over growth equities. In our article <a class=\"link yahoo-link\" data-ylk=\"slk:13 Value Stocks to Buy With High Dividend Yields;elm:context_link;itc:0;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-value-stocks-buy-high-152327724.html\">13 Value Stocks to Buy With High Dividend Yields</a>, we reported that the MSCI World Value Index outperformed its growth counterpart by over 20 percentage points last year.

			"When investing in dividend stocks, many investors find undervalued dividend aristocrat stocks appealing because they offer the potential for both income generation and capital appreciation. Moreover, dividend aristocrats have outperformed the broader market during periods of market downturns.

			"While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.",
			"Southern Copper was able to grow its EPS at 27% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. We don't think it is entirely coincidental that the EPS growth is reasonably close to the 32% average annual increase in the share price. This observation indicates that the market's attitude to the business hasn't changed all that much. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.",

			"We're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward.

			"It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Southern Copper, it has a TSR of 167% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the <em>total</em> shareholder return.",
			"It's good to see that Southern Copper has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 37% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 14% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Southern Copper better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:We've identified 3 warning signs  with Southern Copper (at least 1 which can't be ignored);elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nyse-scco/southern-copper?blueprint=2498260&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=integrated-pitch&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong> We've identified 3 warning signs </strong> with Southern Copper (at least 1 which can't be ignored) </a> , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.",

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 86% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.",
			"Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.",

			"Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.",
			"We can see that Air Products and Chemicals does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Air Products and Chemicals' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.",
			"Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Air Products and Chemicals. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.3% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.5% and 5.8%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.",
			"A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 21 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.",
			"Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.",
			"While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.",
			"Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.",
			"Our information suggests that Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$219m of stock.

			"The general public-- including retail investors -- own 13% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.",

			"If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues. In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Having said that, from a first glance at <strong>LyondellBasell Industries</strong> (<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:NYSE:LYB;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nyse-lyb/lyondellbasell-industries?blueprint=2496730&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=intro&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NYSE:LYB</a>) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.",
			"If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on LyondellBasell Industries is:",
			"<strong>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</strong>",
			"0.15 = US$4.4b ÷ (US$36b - US$6.5b) <em>(Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023)</em>.",
			"Thus, <strong>LyondellBasell Industries has an ROCE of 15%. </strong> In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Chemicals industry average of 11% it's much better.",
			"<span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:See our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nyse-lyb/lyondellbasell-industries?blueprint=2496730&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> See our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries </a></span>",

			"In terms of LyondellBasell Industries' historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 26%, but since then they've fallen to 15%. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.",
			"Bringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by LyondellBasell Industries' reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Unsurprisingly, the stock has only gained 9.2% over the last five years, which potentially indicates that investors are accounting for this going forward. As a result, if you're hunting for a multi-bagger, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.",

The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is just the case here, as elaborated below.<br/><br/><strong>Earnings ESP:</strong> Earnings ESP for Air Products is +2.25%.This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is currently pegged at $2.70 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $2.64. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br/><br/><strong>Zacks Rank:</strong> Air Products currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.",
			"The company expects adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter to be in the range of $2.50-$2.70, implying a rise of 7-15% from the year-ago reported number.<br/><br/>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for the to-be-reported quarter currently stands at $3,020 million, which suggests a rise of 2.5% from the year-ago reported number.<br/><br/>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Industrial Gases – Americas Segment’s revenues is currently pegged at $1,201 million, implying a rise of 1.2% year over year.<br/><br/>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Industrial Gases – Asia Segment’s revenues currently stands at $733 million, suggesting a decline of 2.4% from the year-ago reported number.<br/><br/>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Industrial Gases – Europe Segment’s revenues is currently pegged at $766 million, indicating a rise of 3.7% year over year.",
			"Air Products is expected to have benefited from investments in high-return projects, new business deals, acquisitions and productivity initiatives in the quarter to be reported. It is carrying out its growth programs and remains committed to its gasification strategy. These initiatives are anticipated to have contributed favorably to its earnings and cash flows. The positive impact of higher pricing is also expected to reflect on its performance.<br/><br/>Air Products is driving productivity to improve its cost structure. It is seeing the positive impacts of its productivity actions. Benefits from additional productivity and cost improvement programs are likely to have supported its margins in the fiscal second quarter.<br/><br/>However, cost inflation presents problems for Air Products. In its merchant business, rising power prices are being observed. Due to the significantly elevated natural gas and power prices, the company is experiencing considerably higher energy costs, especially in EMEA. It is anticipated to have experienced sustained difficulties due to the rise in the cost of power. Higher power costs are likely to have adversely impacted its second-quarter margins.<br/><br/>The company is facing headwinds from unfavorable currency translation as well. Significant currency headwinds were experienced in the last reported quarter. A stronger U.S. dollar triggered unfavorable currency translation, which hurt its sales by 6% and earnings per share by 15 cents in the quarter. APD is expected to have faced sustained headwinds from adverse currency swings in the second quarter.",

			"Good morning, and thank you for joining the call. <br/>I'll begin on Slide 4. Our first quarter of 2023 provided a strong start to the year. It was a fairly quiet quarter for us, and our portfolio performance was strong and steady. Revenue was $170 million for the quarter, and operating cash flow was $109 million, which were both up nicely from the same period last year. Earnings were $64 million or $0.97 per share. After a minor adjustment, adjusted earnings were $0.96 per share. We paid $25 million in dividends at our increased rate for 2023 of $1.50 per share, which is a 7% increase over the 2022 level. We have an unmatched record in the precious metals sector for consistent dividend increases, and we have increased the dividend for 22 consecutive years.<br/>We made a payment on our revolver of $75 million, and we ended the quarter with liquidity of almost $650 million. Additionally, we completed an investor update 2 weeks ago and went into detail on some of our newer assets and where we have seen some interesting developments at those additions. We also discussed our 2023 guidance during that update and provided an overview of our 2022 ESG report, which is available on our website. We have advanced our report significantly in the ESG area, and the report contains some good detail on how we're tracking data like GHG emissions and water use in our portfolio. It also includes disclosure in alignment with TCFD guidelines as well as our first climate scenario analysis for the portfolio. ESG reporting is an evolving subject area, so I encourage you to review the report and provide us any feedback.<br/>I'll now turn the call over to Mark to provide some comments on the portfolio.",
			"<strong>Mark E. Isto</strong>",
			"Thanks, Bill. Turning to Slide 5, I'll give some comments on first quarter revenue. Overall volume for the quarter was a very strong 90,000 GEOs, which is up over 4% from this time last year. Our royalty segment contributed $55 million in revenue, down slightly from the prior year quarter. Lower contributions from Penasquito and Voisey's Bay were partially offset by strong revenue at Cortez from the Legacy Zone and our new CC Zone. We also received our annual revenue payment from Red Chris in the quarter and new royalty revenue of about $850,000 from King of the Hills in Australia.<br/>Our stream segment revenue was about $115 million, up about 9% compared to the prior year quarter. higher contributions from Khoemacau, Mount Milligan, Xavantina and Rainy River more than offset lower revenue from Andacollo. Please note that we received 1 shipment each of gold and copper equating to about 6,000 GEOs from Mount Milligan in mid-February earlier than our original end of March forecast. The early delivery allowed these shipments containing this 6,000 GEOs to be sold in the March quarter rather than our original expectation of during the June quarter. These timing differences are not unusual for us. And while they don't impact results on a long-term basis, they can have a fairly significant impact on how 1 quarter compares to the next.<br/>I'd like to spend a moment on this point and turn to Slide 6 to review the sequence of mine production through the stream metal sales. We have 3 large stream interest in mines that produce metal concentrate: Mount Milligan, Andacollo and Khoemacau. As shown in the schematic, the process of mining ore to delivering metal to Royal Gold can take up to 5 months due to the timing required to ship concentrates from the mine site to the smelter and the payment provisions of the offtake contract. Once metal is delivered, we usually plan to sell it steadily over the period where we receive the next delivery from our counterparty. We aim to have 0 metal in inventory for any particular counterparty when we receive the next shipment from the same counterparty.<br/>Selling deliveries steadily allows us to realize pricing that is consistent with average metal prices over those periods. While this approach works well, it may cause complications for forecasting our revenue based on guidance provided by mine operators. The first complication is the production guidance provided by our counterparties for a specific period won't impact Royal Gold in that same period. For example, Centerra expects 2023 Mount Milligan gold production of 160,000 to 170,000 ounces with production of 30% to 35% of the concentrate containing that gold in the fourth quarter. The typical lag we see at Mount Milligan between production at the mine and metal deliveries to Royal Gold is up to 5 months. So we likely won't receive metal deliveries from the expected strong fourth quarter of production until sometime in the second quarter of 2024. We won't recognize revenue until the sales of those deliveries are complete.<br/>The second complication is that delivery timing is uncertain. We prepare our delivery forecast and sales guidance based on our near maximum contractual delivery timing so we can receive deliveries earlier than we forecast. That's what happened in this quarter with the 6,000 GEOs from Mount Milligan I mentioned earlier. In this case, we sold metal and recognized revenue in the first quarter that we otherwise expected to receive and sell in the second quarter. While this may mean that Royal Gold's revenue may be variable from one quarter to the next, the resulting short-term variability is not a long-term concern for us. It also does not necessarily mean that production at the underlying asset is weaker or stronger from one quarter to the next.<br/>These timing issues are more significant for stream agreements on operations that produce concentrates, and they are generally not a factor for stream agreements on operations that produce dore or our royalty portfolio where time between metal production, deliveries and sales is more limited. The timing effects associated with delivery are generally up to about 5 months for Mount Milligan and Andacollo and about 1 month for Khoemacau. Our selling process would typically take 1 month following delivery but will vary depending on the cadence of deliveries.<br/>I'll now turn to Slide 7 and give a handful of comments on recent development at operations. We provided more fulsome commentary during our investor update 2 weeks ago, so I'll only mention developments that have occurred since then. At Khoemacau, where operations are continuing at nameplate capacity, KCM has provided silver production guidance of 1.5 million to 1.7 million ounces for 2023. This is in line with the mine plan but lower than the life of mine average of 1.8 million to 2 million ounces per year. This is because the silver grade in the upper portion of the Zone 5 deposit is lower than the average reserve grade, and we expect the grade to increase as mining progresses deeper into the ore body.<br/>At Pueblo Viejo, Barrick reported yesterday that first ore had been fed through the crusher of the expanded plant. They're working on commissioning the new plant infrastructure and expect to complete commissioning and move into the ramp-up phase in the current quarter. This is about a 1/4 delayed from their previous expectations. While we had no prior notice of this delay, this is a large and complex project. So we felt it prudent to provide a timing allowance, reflecting reduced production, which we included in our sales guidance for 2023.<br/>Pueblo Viejo silver deliveries were approximately 362,200 ounces in the quarter, including the deferral of an additional 5,700 ounces, resulting in a remaining balance of 518,400 deferred ounces. We expect the silver recovery could remain highly variable while the expanded plant ramps to full production and performance levels, and we don't expect material deliveries of deferred silver this year. We continue to see this as a cash flow timing issue and don't expect it to have any lasting impact on silver revenue.<br/>At Cortez, Barrick has advised that contained gold and proven and probable reserves at the Legacy Zone was 2.7 million ounces at the end of 2022. Recall, our overlapping royalties on this area are equivalent to an approximate gross royalty of 9.4%. And 2023 production guidance for this area is expected to range from 450,000 to 480,000 ounces. The remainder of production from Cortez in 2023 will be covered by the CC Zone royalty which has an approximate 1.6% gross royalty rate. Based on Barrick's disclosure, we expect production from this area to be approximately 535,000 ounces.<br/>Barrick also reported yesterday that the record of decision for Goldrush will likely be delayed until the second half of this year. They also reported the continuation of test stoping and development and don't expect this delay to affect their 2023 outlook.<br/>Finally, at Andacollo, Teck has advised that 2023 gold production will range from 22,000 to 27,000 ounces of gold in concentrate. Keep in mind that deliveries to Royal Gold include a fixed 89% payability factor on this production. I'll now turn the call over to Paul for a review of our financial results.",
			"<strong>Paul K. Libner</strong>",
			"Thanks, Mark. I will now turn to Slide 8 and give an overview of the financial results for the quarter. For this discussion, I will be comparing the quarter ended March 31, 2023 to the prior year quarter. Revenue was $170 million for the quarter, an increase of 5%. The main driver of the higher revenue this quarter was stronger operating performance at many of our interests as well as new revenue of approximately $6 million from the addition of Cortez royalty interest we acquired during the second half of 2022.<br/>With respect to metal prices and compared to the prior year quarter, the price of gold was up slightly by 1%, silver was down 6% and copper was down 11%. Gold remains the dominant revenue source making up 71% of our total revenue followed by copper at 14% and silver at 12%.<br/>Turning to Slide 9. G&amp;A expense increased to $11 million and $8.9 million in the prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher employee-related costs, which costs also include noncash employee stock compensation expense. Although inflationary pressures continue to have an impact on many within the metals and mining sector, our cash G&amp;A costs have remained low or less than 5% of total revenue.<br/>Our DD&amp;A expense decreased to $46 million from $48 million in the prior year quarter. On a unit basis, this expense was $514 per GEO for the quarter compared to $555 per GEO in the prior year period. The DD&amp;A rate on a unit basis declined in the current quarter due to lower depletion rates at Mount Milligan and Pueblo Viejo, which were the result of reserve additions at the end of 2022. The decrease was partially offset by increased depletion expense at Khoemacau, which was the result of higher silver sales due to the continued ramp up when compared to the prior year quarter.<br/>Interest expense increased to $9.2 million for the quarter from $900,000 in the prior period. The increase was due to higher average amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and higher interest rates when compared to the prior period. The all-in interest rate for borrowings under our credit facility was 6.2% at the end of the first quarter. Tax expense for the quarter was $16 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 19.9%. This compares to $15 million and an effective tax rate of 18.8% in the prior year period.<br/>Earnings for the quarter were down slightly over the prior year to $64 million or $0.97 per share. After a minor adjustment for a change in the fair value of equity securities, our adjusted earnings were $63 million or $0.96 per share. Adjusted earnings in the prior year quarter were $65 million or $0.99 per share. The main contributor to the lower earnings this quarter when compared to the prior year was higher interest expense.<br/>Our operating cash flow was strong this quarter at $109 million compared to $101 million in the prior year. The increase during the quarter was the result of higher proceeds received from our stream segment and new proceeds received from the recently acquired additional Cortez royalty interest.<br/>I will now turn to Slide 10 and provide a summary of our financial position at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we repaid $75 million on the revolving credit facility and reduced the amount drawn on the facility to $500 million. The $500 million undrawn revolver capacity, combined with $134 million of working capital, provided us total available liquidity of approximately $634 million at the end of the quarter. In keeping with our approach to capital allocation, we expect to repay the $500 million outstanding revolver balance as cash flow allows.<br/>Absent any further business development activity and accretive amount of prices, we anticipate repaying this amount by around mid-2024. Beyond our current debt outstanding, we have no other material financial commitments remaining. Shortly after quarter end, we made a $2.4 million exploration payment to a subsidiary of Ero Copper related to the successful conversion of resources at Xavantina. After this payment, we are potentially obligated to fund additional advanced payments of up to $4.4 million if Ero meets certain exploration and resource conversion targets through the end of 2024.<br/>That concludes my comments on our financial performance for the quarter, and I will now turn the call back to Bill for closing comments.",
			"<strong>William H. Heissenbuttel</strong>",
			"Thanks, Paul. This was a quiet and steady quarter for Royal Gold. Our portfolio performed well, and we saw continued progress at several assets in the portfolio that should provide interesting news flow in the near to medium term. I hope you found the discussion on timing helpful. Recent announcements regarding Centerra's 2023 production expectations at Mount Milligan and Pueblo Viejo expansion and the Goldrush record of decision are good examples of how timing issues can impact expectations for a particular time period in 2023 in particular. However, we take a longer-term view of events and are pleased with our portfolio performance. We remain focused on the balance sheet and rebuilding our liquidity in the quarter after a very active year in 2022, and I think we're very well positioned to remain active in 2023.<br/>Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now open the line for questions.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Josh Wolfson from RBC Capital Markets.",
			"<strong>Joshua Mark Wolfson</strong>",
			"Two quick questions for me. First one is for the Cortez Legacy royalty, which outperformed our expectations and I guess what the guidance implies for the year, Barrick had talked about a bit of a weaker result this quarter and then results improving through the rest of the year. But given the royalty payout was so high this quarter, I'm just wondering if expectations have changed at all based on the first quarter performance or if this was as expected.",
			"<strong>William H. Heissenbuttel</strong>",
			"Josh, thanks for the question. I might turn that one over to Mark for a response.",
			"<strong>Mark E. Isto</strong>",
			"Yes, sure. I guess my view is that we would look at the full year guidance as the best view on the future for the year. I mean, they delivered about 37% on the midpoint of the guidance during the first quarter. So I would just take it as a strong first quarter but we wouldn't change our view for the rest of the year. We would uphold the guidance that they pulled.",
			"<strong>Joshua Mark Wolfson</strong>",
			"Okay. Got it. It sounds like it did perform a bit better, but maybe too soon to make any conclusions.",
			"<strong>Mark E. Isto</strong>",
			"I would agree with your statement.",
			"<strong>Joshua Mark Wolfson</strong>",
			"Okay. Got it. Mildly optimistic there. And the second question is, I may have missed this, but the company does typically provide some sort of stream production guidance for the upcoming quarter. Was there a number that the team felt comfortable with issuing? Or should we just look at the annual figures for production of this year?",
			"<strong>William H. Heissenbuttel</strong>",
			"Yes. Josh, we moved away from the quarterly stream segment sales forecast when we went to first the 6-month guidance and then [full year] guidance. The only time we do do it is in February for the first quarter. But we don't -- we haven't continued that -- what we used to do a couple of years ago. So I'd stick with the annual guidance as something to look to.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question we have comes from Cosmos Chiu from CIBC.",
			"<strong>Cosmos Chiu</strong>",
			"I guess you sort of answered this question, but I'll ask you anyways. You did over 90,000 GEOs in Q1. Your 2023 guidance, which is still pretty fresh, 320,000 to 345,000. And so I know there's timing differences and whatnot, but if I were to sort of multiply out Q1, you would exceed the top end. So again, how should we look at it? Like, again, I know the guidance is pretty fresh. I know the 6,000 ounces that contributed to Q1. But either way, how should we look at it?",
			"<strong>William H. Heissenbuttel</strong>",
			"Yes. Cosmos, I guess what I would just caution you just don't annualize what we just did. As you say, the guidance we gave was 2 weeks ago. we remain comfortable with it. And you actually noted the 6,000 GEOs. We didn't expect them in the first quarter. We expected them in the second quarter and then they arrived early. So again, I'd keep an eye on the longer-term number.",
			"<strong>Cosmos Chiu</strong>",
			"Maybe I asked a different way. When would you start reviewing and potentially updating your guidance? Again, this is only 2 weeks old. But when does that process sort of start?",
			"<strong>William H. Heissenbuttel</strong>",
			"My view is we look at it every time we come to one of these meetings. It's part of the quarterly analysis. And if we felt the need to adjust the range, we don't say, \"Okay, it's going to be the August meeting,\" or at some other point. So it's regularly reviewed on a quarterly basis, and we'd let you know if we needed to make an adjustment.",
			"<strong>Cosmos Chiu</strong>",
			"Of course. Maybe switching gears a little bit, a follow-up on my buddy, Josh's question. In terms of Cortez, thanks, Alistair, once again and team, for giving us guidance, 9.4% of Legacy and 1.6% of CC. Clearly, that's very simplistic and there's a lot more behind it in terms of different zones and whatever. Based on what you know, like how is that reconciling so far in terms of your expectations? And what's actually sort of coming through? Again, I understand that's early stage. I guess I'm just trying to get to -- from what -- your perspective, as you have more information, like how is it reconciling so far to what you had expected?",
			"<strong>William H. Heissenbuttel</strong>",
			"Yes. Cosmos, looking at it, we only have had 2 quarters of the Rio Tinto royalty, and we only had 1 quarter of the Idaho royalty, really. I mean, (inaudible) of full quarters. So it might be a little early to reconcile. But Mark, is there anything you've seen in the numbers that would make us want to adjust the 9.4% and the 1.6% or how we describe these things?",
			"<strong>Mark E. Isto</strong>",
			"No, I don't think so. I think the -- we've always tried to provide a guidance, gross royalty on the Legacy Zone, as we call it now. And historically, it's been a very accurate way to present it to the public. So that's why we continue to do it. So I'm very happy with how we approach it and how we try to convey that information.",
			"<strong>Cosmos Chiu</strong>",
			"Good to hear.",
			"<strong>Mark E. Isto</strong>",
			"Cosmos, and maybe...",
			"<strong>William H. Heissenbuttel</strong>",
			"I don't -- sorry, I would just say, I don't think you really would want us to go through GSR1, GSR2, GSR3, NVR1 and NVR1C, NVR2 and NVR3. We're trying to make your life easier with it. But if we see some issue with where production is falling, we would certainly consider reclassifying how we describe it.",
			"<strong>Cosmos Chiu</strong>",
			"I agree. Don't give me any more details. Even better, if you can just give me a number, I think that's even better. But you should simplify as much as you can.<br/>And then one last question here. In terms of your balance sheet, again, great to see that you're repaying your debt, especially in today's higher interest rate environment. Is the plan to kind of pay it back as quick as possible and just continue with it? Or how do we look at it in terms of balancing out potential opportunities out there?",
			"<strong>William H. Heissenbuttel</strong>",
			"Well, we're not going to let repayments under the revolver trump a good investment opportunity. So you're correct in saying the goal is to pay it back as quickly as possible in the absence of a business development opportunity. But if we see a good opportunity, and we have to take the balance back up, we would certainly consider doing that. We don't -- the top of our strategic goals is not to reduce this to 0 before we do anything else.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"No other questions on the phone line. I'll hand back to the management team. If they want any closing remarks.",
			"<strong>William H. Heissenbuttel</strong>",
			"Yes. Great. Thank you to everyone for taking the time to join us today. We certainly appreciate your interest in Royal Gold, and we look forward to updating you on our progress during our next quarterly call. Have a good day.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Thank you, everyone. This does conclude today's call. You may now disconnect your lines."

(Operator Instructions). <br/>Now I'd like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations for Vulcan Materials. Mr. Warren, you may begin, sir.",
			"<strong>Mark D. Warren</strong>",
			"Good morning, and thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials. With me today are Tom Hill, Chairman and CEO; and Mary Andrews Carlisle, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is accompanied by a press release and a supplemental presentation posted to our website, vulcanmaterials.com.

			"<strong>James Thomas Hill</strong>",
			"Thank you, Mark, and thank all of you for joining our call this morning. Vulcan Materials is well positioned to deliver attractive growth in 2023. We got off to a solid start in the first quarter and now expect to deliver between $1.85 billion and $1.95 billion in adjusted EBITDA this year, a 14% to 20% improvement versus the prior year. In the quarter, we generated $338 million of adjusted EBITDA, a 15% improvement over the prior year. Despite lower volumes in each of our major product lines, total gross profit improved 12% and gross margin expanded by 90 basis points. I'm pleased with our team's execution as they remain focused on our Vulcan Way of Selling and Vulcan Way of operating disciplines. <br/>The pricing environment is healthy. Year-over-year adjusted aggregates price improved 19% in the quarter. Prices also improved in our downstream products by 15% in asphalt and 12% in concrete. As always, we are focused on capitalizing on pricing momentum and controlling costs to expand our margins. In the aggregates segment, gross margin improved by 170 basis points. Shipments declined 2% versus the prior year with wide variations across markets. Some areas benefited from favorable weather and carryover shipments from the wet fourth quarter. <br/>Others like California and Texas were challenged by excessive rainfall. All geographies delivered double-digit price improvement and importantly, our cash gross profit per ton improved by 23% in the quarter, surpassing $8 per ton on a trailing 12-month basis. In asphalt, gross margins improved by 220 basis points despite higher natural gas and liquid asphalt cost and 11% lower volumes. Significant rainfall negatively impacted shipments in California and Arizona, our largest asphalt markets. <br/>Prices improved by 15% and more than offset higher raw materials costs. Cash unit profitability and asphalt improved by 90% in the quarter. The Concrete segment's cash gross profit was negatively impacted by the 2022 divestiture of our New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania operations as well as weather-impacted volume in Texas and California and the resulting cost challenges. <br/>Now shifting to the dynamic demand environment, which remains mix, both in terms of end uses and timing. We continue to expect modest growth in overall public demand, but contraction in private demand. While single-family housing starts continue to fall, some markets have begun to show early signs of decelerating declines, multifamily housing starts have recently turned negative. However, they remained at high levels, particularly in Vulcan markets and continue to dampen some of the impact of single-family weakness. <br/>Affordability is the fundamental driver of the declines in single-family activity. Low inventories, favorable demographic trends, and employment growth in our markets continue to support demand for new residential construction. While the pipeline of private nonresidential projects remain supportive of near-term demand starts have eased in recent months. A positive trend in nonresidential construction activity is the increasingly broad-based composition of starts. Industrial and manufacturing projects now account for more than 60% of starts. Recent trends in supply chain management, onshoring and clean energy investment are among the catalysts for this shift in the drivers of nonresidential construction. <br/>Our geography and service capabilities enable us to capitalize on these large projects. We have booked and are currently shipping to a number of these projects in many of our key markets, such as battery plants, electric vehicle manufacturing facilities, LNG facilities and large warehouse parks. On the public side, momentum is building with trailing 12-month highway starts now exceeding $100 billion. The Infrastructure Investment in Jobs Act's dollars are flowing. The impact of these historic levels of public construction awards on 2023 aggregate shipments will depend upon how quickly starts can turn into shipments. <br/>Other infrastructure starts are also growing, with trailing 12-month starts up 23%, in addition to significant IIJA funding for water, energy, ports and airports, strong state and municipal revenue support non-highway infrastructure investment. Overall, 2023 demand for aggregates continues to be dependent upon the depth of the decline in residential construction activity and the timing of highway starts converting into aggregate shipments. Our durable aggregates business and best-in-class execution position us well to successfully navigate any shifts in demand. <br/>Now I'll turn the call over to Mary Andrews for some additional commentary on our first quarter performance and update 2023 outlook. Mary Andrews.",
			"<strong>Mary Andrews Carlisle</strong>",
			"Thanks, Tom, and good morning. In the first quarter, our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 140 basis points, with solid operational execution and disciplined SAG cost management. Our SAG expenses as a percentage of revenue improved by 60 basis points in the quarter and moved below 7% on a trailing 12-month basis. We remain focused on continuing to leverage our SAG cost base while making strategic investments in talent and technology to support our business needs. <br/>Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.2x at quarter end, squarely within our stated target range of 2 to 2.5x. Our investment-grade balance sheet gives us flexibility and optionality to continue investing in both organic and inorganic opportunities. During the quarter, we invested $113 million in capital expenditures and continue to expect to spend between $600 million and $650 million for the full year. As we allocate capital, we are focused on improving our return on invested capital. <br/>On a trailing 12-month basis, our return on invested capital improved sequentially by 20 basis points from year-end to 13.7%. Tom shared with you our increased adjusted EBITDA outlook for 2023. On the heels of a strong 2022, in which adjusted EBITDA improved by 12%, we now expect to exceed that growth in 2023 with 14% to 20% improvement. Based on the success of our aggregates pricing efforts in the first quarter, which yielded 10% sequential improvement and 19% mix adjusted year-over-year improvement, we now expect prices to improve approximately 15% for the full year. <br/>Coupling with strong pricing momentum with our industry-leading operational execution, we expect to deliver even stronger year-over-year improvement in cash gross profit per ton than our original guidance. All other aspects of the full year guidance we communicated in February remain unchanged. <br/>I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for some closing remarks.",
			"<strong>James Thomas Hill</strong>",
			"Thank you, Mary Andrews. In closing, I want to remind you of 2 things that we are focused on each and every day. First, keeping our people safe. Our people are the lifeblood of our business and our culture. Second, improving unit profitability and growing earnings regardless of the demand environment. Our aggregates-led business and our best-in-class execution position us well for driving long-term sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. <br/>And now Mary Andrews and I will be happy to take your questions.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Trey Grooms, Stephens.",
			"<strong>Trey Grooms</strong>",
			"Nice work on the quarter and aggregates pricing, particularly strong. So hats off to you and the team for such strong execution there. And Tom, I was hoping maybe you could talk a little more specifically about the overall pricing environment and your thoughts on kind of the rest of the year as we look through the balance of the year for pricing.",
			"<strong>James Thomas Hill</strong>",
			"Sure, Trey. As you saw, prices up 19% mix adjusted for the quarter, so a great start. Our January 1 price increases were successful and they're really broad based. So I appreciate our team's hard work on earning price. And based on that success, you saw us raise the guidance to 15% for the full year. Trey, as we said, the pricing comps will get a lot tougher in the second half of the year. So a good start to the year, but there is always work to be done to earn price. And we feel really good about the 15%. But remember, you still have to take that price to the bottom line, which is what happened in the first quarter where we improved our unit margins by some 23%. And that kind of unit margin expansion is generally consistent with what was in our guidance. And that's just the bulk we have ops and the bulk we are selling at work.",
			"<strong>Mary Andrews Carlisle</strong>",
			"Trey, one other thing on that note, on the margin side, we were pleased to -- for aggregates gross margin to expand 170 basis points in the first quarter after being compressed each quarter year-over-year last year as we took those rapidly rising costs through the P&amp;L. And our pricing efforts in 2022 that Tom talked about and has begun now into 2023, returned us to gross margin growth. And we would expect the year-over-year improvement to continue to accelerate as the year progresses.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott, Stifel.",
			"<strong>Stanley Stoker Elliott</strong>",
			"Congratulations on the strong start. Tom, you mentioned kind of some nuances developing within the end market. I think that's 1 thing that's different this year versus maybe some other cycles in the past. Would love to get your kind of thoughts around what's happening on the private non-res side since there seems to be more moving parts as we're looking forward?",
			"<strong>James Thomas Hill</strong>",
			"Stanley, yes, you're right. Nonres construction and shipments continues to be really healthy, and we saw that evidence in the first quarter. We would continue to expect the nonresidential sector to maintain the really high levels that we came off of last year. And it's really driven by warehouses, distribution and now manufacturing and industrial. If i have to risk and reward that sector I would put the risk in that sector and would include maybe some slowing and warehouses we have not seen that yet, but we're watching it. And the other question I would have is does like nonres that follow subdivision does it start to slow. Again, I haven't seen that yet, but watching it. <br/>Now the flip side, the potential upside to shipments in nonresidential construction for me would include the number of massive industrial and manufacturing projects that are on the horizon are just starting to ship. To give you some color around that. We have -- now have some 20 -- excuse me, some 12 major industrial projects, most of which are in our backlogs that total 8.5 million tons. Now some of those are multiyear projects so all of that's not going to go into '23. So I would describe non-res right now is very healthy, so far so good for a healthy nonresidential demand in 2023.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari, Citi.",
			"<strong>Anthony James Pettinari</strong>",
			"I think previously, you talked about ag shipments to public projects expected to be up maybe low single digits in 2023 with IIJA maybe flowing through in the back half. And I was wondering if you had any sort of updated thoughts on the cadence of those public volumes over the remaining quarters of the year or maybe between the first half and the second half. How we should think about the flow through, especially with IIJA projects?",
			"<strong>James Thomas Hill</strong>",
			"Yes. I would tell you, back half loaded, simple answer to that question. The sector -- the highway sector is really the whole public sector, but particularly highways, is set up for a really robust future. Funding is at all-time record levels. And importantly, all 3 areas of funding of government are at record levels. You got federal, state and municipal all at all-time highs. And all of that is starting to flow into lettings. Give you a little color around lettings, which are really healthy. In California, in the fourth quarter of last year, first quarter of this year, combined, those lettings will be over $2 billion, which is an all-time high for 2 quarters in California. <br/>Moving to Texas is even better. In the first 2 quarters of 2023, the lettings will be at some almost $8 billion, again, all-time high. So highway contract awards, as we said, are now over $100 billion. And we still -- so we'll still see -- we'll see '23 shipments, we predict, in low single digit. And that is just -- that is indicative of how much time it takes for those big lettings to flow through the shipments. So a solid '23, but a much larger growth in '24.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Next question comes from Jerry Revich, Goldman Sachs.",
			"<strong>Jerry David Revich</strong>",
			"Nice quarter. I want to ask a couple of things stood out in the quarter on the volume side. If we just think about normal seasonality off of your first quarter run rate that suggests your volumes could actually be up year-over-year in the second quarter. And I'm just wondering, is that consistent with the cadence that you're seeing in the business and similar vein, really strong gross margins for aggregates in the quarter. Normally, your margins are up 10 points 2Q versus 1Q, and I'm wondering is that the cadence we should be thinking about here as well?",
			"<strong>James Thomas Hill</strong>",
			"Yes, I'll take the volume and let Mary Andrews handle the margin. I think the volumes were -- in the quarter, we were down 2%, and weather had a big play on that. Weather in California and Texas and Arizona were a drag on us. But the weather in the East and Southeast were really positive. And in the East and Southeast, we probably had some volume that pushed from the fourth quarter last year, which had really wet weather, into the first quarter of this year. <br/>As far as our outlook, it really hasn't changed, the negative 2% to 6%. We've got challenges in single-family, which are going to be more second half loaded. Nonres, as you heard me say, is really solid. And highways is coming along, but it takes a little time. I think, for me, the timing is going to be key of how fast those highway shipments go from lettings to shipments. <br/>But in all of this, I think it is a backdrop. We've got the Vulcan Way of Selling and the Vulcan Way of operating, which gives me confidence that will continue to improve our performance regardless of the challenges, which you've seen us do quarter in and quarter out over the last few years.",
			"<strong>Mary Andrews Carlisle</strong>",
			"Yes. And Jerry, in terms of margins, yes, I think a typical sequential improvement is what you should expect. And as I said, on a year-over-year basis, we'll see significant acceleration quarter-to-quarter as we progress off that 170 basis points from the first quarter.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Mike Dahl, RBC Capital.",
			"<strong>Michael Glaser Dahl</strong>",
			"Mary Andrews, with respect to the other parts of the guidance, I think last quarter, I'm not sure if this was a formal guide, but you talked about cost of inflation being up high single digits. And you said that cost and ag is tracking consistent with expectations. So I'm wondering kind of if that's still the expectation. And then if it is, is it right to think about, from a gross profit per ton standpoint, the new price on top of that might suggest something in kind of like a low 20s year-on-year increase percentage-wise for gross profit per ton?",
			"<strong>James Thomas Hill</strong>",
			"Yes. Quickly, you're correct on your assumption on gross profit per ton improvements. If I step back and look at cost, we're still facing the impact of stubborn inflation in parts and services. If you looked in the first quarter, weather on the West had negatively impacted the first quarter cost. Remember, as we progress through the year, our comps on costs get a whole lot easier. So we're still guiding to the high single-digit cost inflation. <br/>And I would describe that as probably higher-than-expected parts and services and also delays in delivery is costing us just because it keeps equipment down. That's offset some by probably better-than-expected diesel cost. We'll -- but all that being said, we'll continue to work on our operating efficiencies to the bulk we have operating, but, at this point, I think we're still very comfortable with that high single-digit guide.",
			"<strong>Mary Andrews Carlisle</strong>",
			"Yes. And Mike, just on the gross profit per ton -- the cash gross profit per ton improvement from the beginning, we thought that'd be much more consistent this year. And so that 23% you saw in the first quarter and the low 20s for the rest is a good assumption.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson, Thompson Research Group.",
			"<strong>Kathryn Ingram Thompson</strong>",
			"Great quarter. I just have a clarification. Based on our channel checks, we're seeing, as you already described, pretty robust demand in the year and even possibly some tightness in materials in some key markets or multiple markets throughout the U.S. as we enter the construction season. In light of the strong pricing commentary you had in the quarter, this has opened up the possibility for additional pricing actions midyear? And then also, along with that, more of a mid- to long-term view, when you look at reassuring, population ship and government-supported funding for IIJA, Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS act, how does this play into your mid- to long-term view on pricing?",
			"<strong>James Thomas Hill</strong>",
			"Yes. I think that -- so as far as pricing in the rest of the year, we did not assume a second half price increase in our 15% guide. That said, we are -- have announced midyear price increases in most -- in the vast majority of our markets. We feel like you got to earn that first. So we'll report on our progress on those midyear efforts in August. As far as bid work, we're pushing price day in and day out on our bid work, and that's just part of our Vulcan Way of Selling. <br/>As far as the -- you're spot on, on the large projects. Both on the public side, highways and on-highway, we're going to see a lot more large projects and a lot more money flowing. We also, as you said, starting to see the big manufacturing industrial projects, which we think continue well into the future. <br/>All of that bodes extremely well for pricing because that gives us and our customers visibility to coming demand. And those large projects, both public and the big industrial ones, tends to be -- there's more surety of those projects than once they announce them, they're going to happen. And so that also gives surety demand, which is a very good backdrop for pricing.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Keith Hughes, Truist Securities.",
			"<strong>Keith Brian Hughes</strong>",
			"I guess switching to the discussion on nonresidential, specifically on heavy. There's a lot of positives out there right now. How far of visibility do you have on that business? In other words, could we be seeing several years of really strong heavy work to be done?",
			"<strong>James Thomas Hill</strong>",
			"Yes. That -- you are going to see a number of years, both in manufacturing and industrial and in the big energy projects along the coast. There is a healthy pipeline of that, both in either their budgeting, their bidding or their engineering. And so I -- like you said, I believe we'll see years of this, and I think it will really bode well both for volumes and price.",
			"<strong>Keith Brian Hughes</strong>",
			"And you're on that your light business, that I give the shorter cycle, your visibility is not nearly that long on light. Is that correct?",

			"Our next question comes from Brent Thielman, D.A. Davidson.",
			"<strong>Brent Edward Thielman</strong>",
			"Tom, I'm just curious on the balance. What was the hit from the residential sector this quarter? Because with volume only down 2%, including weather, just on the surface, it doesn't look like that much.",
			"<strong>James Thomas Hill</strong>",
			"So if you look at it, about half of our markets took a hit in res and about half were positive. So I'd tell you, probably mid-single digit. But as we said, the -- we'll feel the impact of the fall in starts, permits and starts in single-family, we'll really feel that in the second half of the year. So pretty much as expected right now. I think it's a -- and plus, with weather in Arizona, Texas and California masked some of that. So it's harder to see. But we think that is more of a second half play as those starts have to go through the pipeline.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Next question comes from Phil Ng, Jefferies.",
			"<strong>Collin Andrew Verron</strong>",
			"This is actually Collin on for Phil. I just wanted to touch on the geographic mix. I know pricing was aided by that favorable mix. But could you talk about that mix might have helped gross margins and how we should think about that mix benefit going forward?",
			"<strong>James Thomas Hill</strong>",
			"I don't think it's a big play on gross margin. It was only 1% on price. So it really did not -- it really didn't have an impact on -- much impact on price or on margins.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Timna Tanners, Wolfe Research.",
			"<strong>Timna Beth Tanners</strong>",
			"Two things I haven't heard you address it, and I would like to hear from, please. One is just the labor markets broadly. I know it's been a bigger issue for your customers, but would appreciate any updated thoughts there. And then it's been -- I think May will be a year anniversary since the Mexican operations were set, and there's been some noise down there. So I would love your take on that as well.",
			"<strong>James Thomas Hill</strong>",
			"Yes. I would describe the labor market is easing. I think it's a combination of the labor market is easing, and I think we've gotten better with retention over the last year and done a lot of work on that. So it is still an issue, probably still a bigger issue for our customers, but not like it was 12 months ago or 18 months ago. On Mexico, really, not a lot of change. We remain legally shut down and the proceedings with the NAFTA tribunal continue. We would hope to get a ruling on that sometime in 2024.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer, Thompson, Davis.",

			"<strong>James Thomas Hill</strong>",
			"Well, I mean, that would be the first time that's happened. So I would doubt that while everybody is wringing their hands over, I think we'll solve this problem, and we'll continue with our infrastructure spending.",
			"<strong>Adam Robert Thalhimer</strong>",
			"I mean prior government shutdowns haven't been a big deal, have they?",
			"<strong>James Thomas Hill</strong>",
			"Well, I don't want to see one, but I don't think it's going to impact our infrastructure projects.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Michael Dudas, Vertical Research.",
			"<strong>Michael Stephan Dudas</strong>",
			"Mary Andrews, if I just can share your thoughts on how operating free cash went through Q1, and how it looks for the rest of the year? And then maybe Tom you could discuss the M&amp;A pipeline? And will we -- best guess, do we see any visible activity by year-end with what's happening in the marketplace?",
			"<strong>Mary Andrews Carlisle</strong>",
			"Yes. So we were pleased with our free cash flow. It's obviously a very cash-generative business. Over the trailing 12 months, our free cash flow conversion has stayed over 90%. So we are pleased with that result, and we'll be -- take our consistent disciplined approach as we think about how to allocate that capital along our waterfall priorities.",
			"<strong>James Thomas Hill</strong>",
			"On M&amp;A, it remains -- I guess we have a number of smaller bolt-ons in the pipeline along with a number of greenfields that we're working on. I would tell you, kind of normal from the smaller bolt-on and greenfield perspective. As far as large projects or large M&amp;A, those tend to be lumpy. When they come along, we'll be in the game and we'll take advantage. And as always, we'll be disciplined and all of this about what markets we're in, what synergies are unique to us and what we pay for it. So -- and we look forward to reporting that as they come about.",

			"Our next question comes from Garik Shmois, Loop Capital.",
			"<strong>Garik Simha Shmois</strong>",
			"Nice quarter. I wanted to ask on the highway outlook, you're counting on demand showing up later this year. Curious just how's the lag between project starts and when volumes occurred, has that changed at all just given the size of the projects in the pipeline?",
			"<strong>James Thomas Hill</strong>",
			"I think a little bit. We would always call that 9 to 12 months, but larger projects can take longer just because of more complex engineering, more complex permitting and more complex planning around those. And when they run into a snag, it stops a big chunk of work or pushes it back. I would not change the 9 to 12 rule of thumb, except for every once in a while now, you'll come across a multimillion ton highway project that can get pushed out past that limit. But I think the 9 to 12 is still a good role of thumb.",

And have you been able to lock up capacity, and if so, for how far forward?",
			"<strong>James Thomas Hill</strong>",
			"I think, as we talk about, rock is still short on all coasts, and it's driven primarily by bottlenecks on railroads. I think the railroads are working hard to improve and they're making progress, but there's still gaps there. And I don't know that I see it as risk for 2023. It has its challenges, but I think we'll work with our partners along and work through those challenges and be fine in 2023.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Michael Feniger, Bank of America.",
			"<strong>Michael J. Feniger</strong>",
			"Two. So the first one, the pricing obviously very strong at 18.5% and your full year range of 15%. So does pricing kind of finish the year -- exit the year below that range? Do you think we still are in that double-digit territory? I'm just trying to figure that pricing cadence. Then the second question, just the operating leverage in aggregate. I think you typically target like a 60% flow through. Is -- are there periods where that can be above that level? I guess I'm just trying to think out midyear price increases, potentially sticking, diesel rolling over, could we see flow through above that target range for certain periods?",
			"<strong>James Thomas Hill</strong>",
			"You can -- first of all, on the flow-through piece of this, you can see that above and you can see it below. Inflation -- big inflationary jumps put pressure on that, as we said, as does fuel. I think if you look at this year, I would be a little bit cautious because you're still going to have some really sticky inflationary pressures on parts and services. I think as what we've said is that, as we progress through the year, the percentage price increase won't stay up at the 20% range because you're comping over such a sequentially high march through 2022 in price. <br/>The flip side of that is in cost. As we've said, you're seeing really high year-over-year cost at this point. They should ease as we go through the year because the inflationary comps ease as we go. All that -- put all that together, we think we're pretty consistent in that 20% range improvement in unit margins.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our final question comes from Dillon Cumming, Morgan Stanley.",
			"<strong>Dillon Gerard Cumming</strong>",
			"Just wanted to ask if you could put a finer point on some of the non-res commentary. I think there are some concerns out there with regards to tighter financing environment, how that could impact both the light and heavy nonres kind of side of the equation, just curious if you're hearing some thoughts around that from customers and what the kind of latest update on the thinking there is?",
			"<strong>James Thomas Hill</strong>",
			"Well, I would put it this way. So far, what we're seeing in nonres is really solid, some shifting towards heavy industrial and manufacturing. But we've not seen any impact on our markets yet on nonresidential. Now that being said, we're watchful, and we're watching it, but so far so good in nonres for 2023. But to your point, I think everybody is watching that, but we haven't seen any impact at this point.",

			"(Bloomberg) -- Lithium’s dramatic price slump has mining heavyweights chasing takeovers of companies with early stage or pre-production projects. But one giant is warning that offering high premiums for smaller miners comes with risks.",
			"Rio Tinto Group Chief Executive Officer Jakob Stausholm said he’s “cautious” about acquisitions at current valuations, despite the world’s second-biggest miner wanting to grow its nascent lithium business.",
			"“It’s very difficult to justify to go in and buy at these high prices, unless you already know you can sell the lithium at a high price,” he told reporters in Perth on Thursday. “We have to make sure that it’s also in the interest of our shareholders and not just the selling shareholders.”",
			"Prices of lithium carbonate, used in EV batteries, have plunged 70% from a peak in November. While that’s had a negative impact on the share valuations of some smaller players, companies are increasingly prepared to offer chunky premiums to grab a slice of the market for what promises to be one of the world’s hottest commodities.",
			"From US miner Albemarle Corp.’s three unsuccessful bids for junior Australian prospect Liontown Resources Ltd., to Chinese producer Tianqi Lithium Corp.’s failed attempt to buy Essential Metals Ltd., M&amp;A momentum is building. Iron ore giant Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. is also getting in on the action with a surprise declaration it was looking for lithium assets in South America.",
			"Tianqi offered a 45% premium for Australian explorer Essential Metals — and still fell short after failing to secure enough support from the target’s shareholders.",
			"Albemarle’s latest A$5.5 billion ($3.7 billion) bid for Liontown represented an eye-watering 64% premium on the smaller company’s previous share price. The Perth-based miner has proved among the most attractive target for potential suiters, though Liontown this week denied media reports it had received a counter offer.",
			"“There’s clearly a premium being paid compared to where the market thought fundamental value sat prior to the offer,” said Max Vickerson, an analyst at Morgans Financials Ltd. “It sounds like a strong premium will be needed” to buy Liontown, he said, while adding that showed “the importance of the industry in the long run.”",
			"As well as betting that lithium prices will rebound despite a wave of new projects coming online in the next few years, would-be buyers are also wagering those mines will live up to their full output potential — no sure thing in an industry often beset by project delays, poorer-than-expected mineral grades and cost over-runs.",
			"And despite the drop in prices this year, the refined EV-battery ingredient is still three times more expensive than in the middle of 2020.",
			"The plunge in lithium prices and some company valuations falling to “less ridiculous levels” were “opening up the opportunity” for more takeovers, said Saul Kavonic, head of integrated energy and resources at Credit Suisse Group AG. “That said, it’s still early days in a very volatile market — that’s why there is still going to be quite a challenging path to get deals done.”",
			"See also: Lithium’s Next Big Risk Is Grand Supply Plans Falling Short",
			"The offers are set to continue as most market-watchers remain optimistic about the long-term demand outlook. Governments around the world are trying to encourage a faster transition to cleaner energy sources, and BloombergNEF forecasts consumption will jump ninefold by 2050.",
			"The race for lithium has also garnered interest from battery manufacturers and even automakers. Tesla Inc. has been weighing a takeover of Toronto-listed Sigma Lithium Corp., which is developing a large lithium rock deposit in Brazil.",
			"Fortescue Chief Executive Officer Fiona Hick said Wednesday that Brazil, Chile and Argentina were the most promising countries for both deals and exploration for lithium, copper and rare earths. Mid-sized or smaller lithium producers, like Pilbara Minerals Ltd., are also seeing opportunities to bet big.",
			"“It’s an incredible market and Pilbara always looks to capitalize on that,” Managing Director Dale Henderson said. “We’re not holding back on our investment,” although the miner is in no hurry to pursue “inorganic growth,” he said. “As the market continues to go well, obviously the coffers will continue to fill, there will be the obvious questions around returns to shareholders,” Henderson said.",

That’s partly because the company’s share price has since sunk back down toward the $610 level, significantly below the average analyst target price above <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:$700;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AVGO/research-ratings\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$700</a>. </span>",
			"<span>In short, Broadcom grew its revenue 16% on a year-over-year basis. This enabled the company to repurchase shares and provide a decent outlook for 8% growth in Q2.  </span>",
			"<span>Broadcom is still working to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:acquire VMWare,;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.networkworld.com/article/3688515/broadcom-vmware-extend-deadline-to-complete-acquisition-by-90-days.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">acquire VMWare,</a> which is likely to spike its stock price closer to that $700 level if it goes through. </span>",

The defense company released Q1 results on April 25 which showed investors a strong, predictable firm with good prospects. </span>",
			"<span>Raytheon <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:reported;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investors.rtx.com/static-files/f391dc2f-926a-4d71-a85a-3630a59e89b1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> 10% overall sales growth along with 10% organic growth. So, why should RTX stock be expected to grow now? I think the answer to that question relates to a few key factors. For one, demand for its products and services is high. The company has a record $180 billion backlog and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.25. Book-to-bill is a comparison of booked orders relative to those that have been processed and are ready to bill.  </span>",
			"<span>Those figures seem to vindicate the general idea that defense spending is trending upward as geopoltical tensions rise. Raytheon reduced its dividend in 2021, but has since increased it <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:twice;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/RTX/dividend\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">twice</a>.

Although sales were flat at $8.2 billion and up only 3% year-over-year, the period was strong overall. Operating profit increased by over 16%, reaching $2 billion. However, earnings per share was where Linde really shined. The company delivered earnings per share of $3.42, well beyond the highest end of the analyst range. In fact, it was the fourth straight quarter in which Linde’s EPS exceeded analysts’ predictions. </span>",

However, sales also declined sharply for the drug, falling 25.2% year-over-year.</span>",
			"<span>That led to an overall sales decline at AbbVie of 9.7%. None of this sounds particularly positive. AbbVie relies on Humira, which is losing patent protection for a large portion of its business. A predictable decline is occurring as expected. </span>",
			"<span>But there’s a caveat here. AbbVie’s sales were slightly above those expected on <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Wall Street;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/abbvie-stock-earnings-humira-sales-drop-10b6875e?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D24867010846680895882203808307966566715%7CMCORGID%3DCB68E4BA55144CAA0A4C98A5%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1682715250\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Street</a>.

Let me explain. </span>",
			"<span>Hershey currently expects sales to decline by 8% in 2023 after releasing Q1 <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:earnings;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.thehersheycompany.com/content/hershey-corporate/en-us/home/newsroom/press-release/press-release-detail.html?122737\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">earnings</a> on April 27. Additionally, the company expects its earnings per share to shrink by 15%. This is a case of seemingly bad news being good news. </span>",
			"<span>An 8% decline in 2023 sales is an upward adjustment to the high end of Hershey’s previous range. That is also true for its earnings per share figures. Indeed, this appears to all be a result of strong consumer demand that resulted in a revenue increase of 12.1% (12.2% organic) in Q1, with overall revenue reaching $2.898 billion. Net income also came in at $587.2 million, up 10.9%. </span>",
			"<span>These strong results are attributable to the fact that consumers remain willing to pay more for everyday items. That truth has been evident across the market as earnings continue to come in and companies continue to report the same idea that consumers are still willing to absorb higher prices. </span>",

			"<b>Mastercard</b><span> (NYSE:<span><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:MA;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/ma-stock-quote/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>MA</strong></a></span>) is a dividend-paying stock to consider buying right now. Notably, MA stock pays a very modest 57 cent dividend that yields 0.6%. Admittedly, that isn’t a particularly compelling reason to buy. Investors don’t really buy this stock for its dividend – it’s the company’s growth profile that continues to shine. </span>",
			"<span>Indeed, </span><span>Mastercard is a smart choice right now for a different set of reasons. Consumer spending remains very strong for one. Mastercard notes as much in its earnings <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:report;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://s25.q4cdn.com/479285134/files/doc_financials/2023/q1/1Q23-Mastercard-Earnings-Release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">report</a>. Management also notes that cross-border travel continues to strengthen given the company further tailwinds. </span>",
			"<span>But at the same time, that’s all a positive spin on a bitter truth. American credit card debt is spiraling out of control.

			"<span>The insurance and healthcare provider’s better-than-expected first quarter results reaffirm that idea. The company’s earnings per share of $6.26 beat expectations by 10 cents. Likewise, the company’s medical loss ratio, at 82.2%, came in lower than expected. That means the company paid fewer medical care premiums overall, in turn contributing to stronger earnings per share figures. </span>",
			"<span>UnitedHealth Group’s dividend is rock-solid, yet modest. Currently, UNH stock yields only 1.35%, but was last reduced in 1990. Let’s run some hypothetical math here to understand the real beauty of UNH stock as an investment. Shares currently trade for $492 but have a<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:target price;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/UNH/research-ratings\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> target price</a> of $596. Assuming dividends remain the same for the next year an investor could reasonably expect their $492 to be worth $602.60 if analysts are correct ($596 + 1.65(4)). That equates to a 22.47% return. That’s an excellent return over a 12 to 18 month period. </span>",

We need to massively increase the number of semiconductor technicians that we train, the number of material scientists and chemists and physicists and engineers that we train because we not only need to get back our edge, but we need to maintain our edge for the long run. And that comes from the research and development. So the goals are still the same. We're on pace to hit them. We're working like crazy. And before the year is out, I think we'll have some pretty significant announcements."

			"<strong>Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.</strong>’s MLM shares jumped 4.27% in the pre-market trading session on May 4 after it reported solid results for first-quarter 2023. Earnings remarkably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased on a year-over-year basis. Revenues beat the same and rose from the prior year.<br/><br/>The metrics improved on the back of solid pricing actions, which drove robust margin expansion despite continued inflationary pressure and modestly lower aggregates shipments.<br/><br/>Ward Nye, chairman and CEO of MLM, stated, “We continue to see solid near-term product demand reinforced by healthy customer backlogs across our coast-to-coast footprint, led by infrastructure and heavy non-residential projects of scale. We expect recent legislation and the resulting enhanced level of public investment in these kinds of aggregates-intensive end-use projects to support continued strong demand for several years to come. While single-family residential construction has slowed, builder sentiment has improved in Martin Marietta geographies as the single-family housing shortage continues to drive a base level of demand in our key Sun Belt markets. We also expect to see an uptick in residential activity as mortgage rates stabilize over the next several months.”<br/><br/>He added, “We are confident in our ability to continue to expand margins throughout the year and expect to deliver compelling full-year financial results more directionally in line with the high end of our previously announced 2023 guidance range, which we will revisit at mid-year.”",
			"Martin Marietta reported adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $2.16 per share, which handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 99 cents by 118.2%. Also, the metric increased a whopping 453.8% from the year-ago quarter’s 39 cents.",
			" ",
			"Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. Quote",
			"Quarterly revenues (including Product and Services and Freight revenues) were $1.35 billion, up 10% from the year-ago period. The metric topped the consensus mark of $1.19 billion by 14.2%.",
			"<strong>Building Materials</strong> (including aggregates, cement, ready-mixed concrete, asphalt, paving product lines and Freight) reported revenues of $1.27 billion, which increased 10.1% year over year. Double-digit pricing gains, partially offset by continued inflationary pressure, led to the gross margin improvement of 970 basis points (bps).<br/><br/>Within the Building Materials’ product and services umbrella, Aggregates’ revenues rose 20.5% of $911.9 million from the year-ago quarter. Cement revenues rose 21.9% year over year to $168.6 million. Ready Mixed Concrete’s revenues decreased 24.4% year over year to $220 million. Revenues in Asphalt and Paving product lines increased 2.1% from the year-ago quarter to $58 million.<br/><br/>Aggregates shipments fell 0.8% year over year and pricing advanced 22.6%. Shipments fell due to historically wet weather in California, partially offset by mild weather and strong demand in the Southeast.<br/><br/>Cement shipments declined 6.8% year over year. Pricing increased 32.2% year over year. The upside was driven by sold-out conditions and the compounding effect of price increases in 2022 and 2023.<br/><br/>Within the Downstream business, ready mixed concrete shipments declined 37.1%, with pricing growth of 20.2% from the prior-year quarter. Asphalt shipments and pricing declined 25.1% and 9.9%, respectively.<br/><br/><strong>Magnesia Specialties </strong>reported revenues of $83.4 million, up 8.4% year over year, driven by higher pricing for all product lines.",
			"The gross profit increased 94% year over year to $302.8 million. The adjusted gross margin was 22.4%, which increased from 12.7% a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA of $323.9 million increased 64.2% year over year. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.9%, up 790 bps from a year ago.",
			"As of Mar 31, 2022, Martin Marietta had cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $229.4 million compared with $358 million at 2022-end. Also, it had $1.20 billion of unused borrowing capacity on its existing credit facilities at March-end. Long-term debt (excluding current maturities) was $4,342 million, down from $4,340.9 million at the 2022-end.<br/><br/>Net cash provided by operations was $160.5 million for the first three months, down from $169.9 million in the year-ago period.",
			"Martin Marietta expects consolidated products and services revenues of $6,600-$6,815 million, up from $6,180-$6,370 million stated earlier. The company anticipates adjusted EBITDA between $1,800 million and $1,900 million.<br/><br/>Interest expenses are likely to be $165-170 million and the tax rate is projected to be 21-22%. Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Martin Marietta are anticipated to be $880-$990 million. Capital expenditure is likely to be $575-625 million.<br/><br/>Within the Building Materials business, total aggregate shipment growth is expected between down 2% and up 2%. Total aggregate pricing per ton is anticipated to grow 13-15%. Gross profit is likely to be $1,225-$1,295 million.",
			"Martin Marietta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see <strong>the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.<br/><br/><strong>Otis Worldwide Corporation</strong> OTIS started 2023 on a solid note. The company’s first-quarter 2023 earnings and sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Its quarterly results reflected the 10th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth, along with solid Service performance, contributing to mid-single-digit adjusted earnings per share growth.<br/><br/>Otis has been focused on strong portfolio growth and generating a solid New Equipment backlog. It intends to expand operating margins, return cash to shareholders through a capital allocation strategy and pursue additional progress toward ESG goals.<br/><br/><strong>United Rentals, Inc.</strong> URI reported first-quarter 2023 results. The company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues beat the same. Nonetheless, on a year-over-year basis, earnings and revenues increased, courtesy of sustained demand in its end markets and the strength of its core rental business.<br/><br/>URI reaffirmed its 2023 guidance, given broad-based end-market activity, contractor backlogs, customer sentiment and solid visibility. The company unveiled a quarterly dividend of $1.48 per share, with an annualized yield of 0.4%. It repurchased $250 million of stock under its existing $1.25-billion share repurchase program.<br/><br/><strong>Masco Corporation</strong> MAS reported better-than-expected results for first-quarter 2023. The top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company has been benefiting from strong pricing actions and operational improvements.<br/><br/>Then again, MAS’ adjusted earnings and net sales declined on a year-over-year basis due to supply-chain challenges and inflation headwinds.",

			"<strong>Vulcan Materials Company</strong> VMC reported impressive first-quarter 2023 results, wherein earnings and revenues surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top and bottom lines grew on a year-over-year basis.<br/><br/>The nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates saw solid growth in aggregates-led business amid a challenging macro-environment. Focus on operating disciplines and strong pricing actions to overcome inflationary pressures were partly offset by unfavorable weather in California and Texas, and a slowdown in residential construction activity, along with high costs.<br/><br/>Share of the company rose 1.9% in the pre-market trading session on May 4, after the earnings release.<br/><br/>The company increased its full-year earnings view to reflect the pricing momentum and solid execution realized in the first-quarter results. It now expects full-year adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1.850 to $1.950 billion.",
			"Adjusted earnings of 95 cents per share topped the consensus mark of 64 cents by 48.4% and increased 30.1% from the year-ago level of 73 cents per share.",
			"Vulcan Materials Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Vulcan Materials Company Quote",
			"Total revenues of $1,649 million surpassed the consensus mark of $1,581 million by 4.3% and increased 7% year over year.",
			"Revenues from the segment increased 15.4% year over year to $1,294.3 million, owing to higher demand across all end-market segments. Aggregate shipments (volumes) declined 2% year over year. The weather across the Southeast and East coast favored shipments on the coasts in the quarter. However, heavy rainfall in California and Texas negatively impacted the company’s shipments throughout most of the quarter. Also, first-quarter volume benefited from a few delayed shipments in the fourth quarter due to unfavorable weather.<br/><br/>Freight-adjusted average sales price rose 20.3% to $18.67 per ton year over year. Freight-adjusted revenues rose 17.4% from the prior-year quarter to $965.9 million. Solid operational execution helped mitigate continued year-over-year inflationary pressure, particularly for parts and services. Effective pricing actions resulted in accelerated growth.<br/><br/>Gross profit of $302.8 million increased 24.7% from the prior year’s levels despite lower shipments. Gross margin expanded 170 basis points (bps) owing to solid pricing.",
			"Revenues from the Asphalt segment were $169.8 million, up 1.6% year over year. The segment generated a gross profit of $0.8 million against a gross loss of $2.9 million a year ago. Volumes fell 11% year over year due to lower shipments in California and Arizona, the company’s largest asphalt markets, due to significant rainfall in the quarter. Asphalt pricing was up 15%, which was partially offset by 7% higher cost for liquid asphalt.<br/><br/>Total revenues from the Concrete segment were $285.1 million, down 20.9% year over year. Gross loss totaled $2.4 million against a gross profit of $28.2 million in the year-ago quarter due to unfavorable weather in California and Texas, a slowdown in residential construction activity and higher costs for diesel fuel. Shipments fell 30% year over year but average selling prices increased 12.1% to $161.3 per cubic yard from the prior-year level.<br/><br/>Total revenues from the Calcium segment were up to $2.3 million from the prior-year figure of $1.9 million. The segment reported a gross profit of $0.8 million, up from $0.7 million a year ago.",
			"Selling, administrative and general (SAG) expenses — as a percentage of total revenues — improved 60 basis points to 7.1% from a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was up 14.9% year over year to $337.6 million.",
			"As of Mar 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were $139.6 million, down from $161.4 million at 2022-end. Long-term debt was $3,876.9 million at first-quarter 2023-end, compared with $3,875.2 million at 2022-end.<br/><br/>In first-quarter 2023, capital expenditures were $113 million. On Mar 31, 2023-end, total debt to trailing-12-months adjusted EBITDA was 2.3x, down from 2.7x from the year-ago quarter. Return on average invested capital was 13.7%, up 20 bps from 2022-end, on a trailing 12 months basis.",
			"For 2023, the company anticipates adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1.850-$1.950 billion and net earnings of $815-$895 million. SAG expenses are expected to be $515-$530 million, with interest expenses of approximately $195 million, depreciation, depletion, accretion, and amortization expense of nearly $610 million, and an effective tax rate of 22%.<br/><br/>In the Aggregates segment, cash gross profit per ton is likely to improve from the 2022 level of $7.83. Total shipments are likely to be down 2-6%. Freight-adjusted price growth is likely to be approximately 15% and freight-adjusted cash cost is estimated to increase in high single digit.<br/><br/>In Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium segment, cash gross profit is expected to be in line with 2022. Asphalt is anticipated to grow on low single-digit growth in volume and price. Also, it is expected to contribute 40-50% of non-aggregates cash gross profit in 2023.<br/><br/>Concrete same-store volumes are expected to decline in the mid-single-digit due to slow residential construction activity. Price growth will likely offset higher raw material cost and contribute approximately 50-60% of non-aggregates cash gross profit.<br/> <br/>In 2023, the company expects to incur capital expenditures of $600-$650 million.",

You can see <strong>the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.<br/><br/><strong>PulteGroup Inc.</strong> PHM reported first-quarter 2023 results, wherein earnings and revenues surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased year over year.<br/><br/>PHM witnessed solid gross orders, closings and margins in the first quarter and posted a 28% increase in earnings per share and a 12-month return on equity of 32%.<br/><br/><strong>D.R. Horton, Inc.</strong> DHI reported second-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Mar 31, 2023) results, wherein earnings and revenues surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.<br/><br/>Although earnings and revenues declined on a year-over-year basis on prevailing softness in the market, DHI highlighted that net sales orders increased 73% from the fiscal first quarter, defying the prevailing higher mortgage rates and inflationary pressure.<br/><br/><strong>Meritage Homes Corporation</strong> MTH reported better-than-expected results for first-quarter 2023. Both earnings and total closing revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.<br/><br/>The metrics, however, declined from the year-ago quarter’s levels owing to ongoing macroeconomic woes. Impressively, MTH paid its first-ever cash dividend of 27 cents per share in the first quarter, totaling $9.9 million.",

			"Lower volumes (excluding the Grupo Gondi acquisition,) cost inflation, economic downtime, higher non-cash pension costs, costs associated with the Mahrt mill work stoppage and business systems transformation costs also impacted results.

Because of their massive footprint, these high-profile companies feature transparent, predictable businesses. However, the other side of this relationship centers on a decided lack of upside potential.",
			"Nevertheless, every now and then, some top enterprises slip under the radar. Here, the best blue-chip stocks for 2023 might not always be generating headlines. Or if they do, those headlines might not be the most encouraging for prospective investors. Still, underneath the hood lie compelling operations that may yield significant rewards. In other words, you can have your cake and eat it too.

Lam’s quiet, everyday relevance for critical semiconductor industries launched LRCX to a nearly 21% return so far this year. In the past 365 days, it’s up over 9%.",
			"Financially, what makes Lam an all-around strong candidate for best blue-chip stocks for 2023 is consistency. As data from Gurufocus.com demonstrates, Lam is consistently profitable. As well, it features a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:three-year revenue growth rate;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/LRCX/summary?search=lrcx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">three-year revenue growth rate</a> of 26.6%, above 81.77% of sector players.",
			"Enticingly, LRCX also ranks among the blue-chip stocks with low risk and high reward. At present, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 17.61. As a discount to projected earnings, Lam ranks better than 61.19% of the competition. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg LRCX as a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:consensus moderate buy;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lrcx/forecast\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">consensus moderate buy</a>. On average, the price target is $545.06, implying 9% upside potential. However, the most optimistic target calls for $600 or up 20%.",

Also, its free cash flow growth rate during the same period is 57.1%, above 85.28% of competitors.",

Thanks to its powerful relevancies, AMAT deserves consideration as one of the blue-chip stocks to buy now. Since the Jan. opener, shares popped up over 14%.",
			"Overall, AMAT also legitimately deserves the label of blue-chip stock with strong fundamentals. Anchored by a solid balance sheet, investors may focus on the company’s three-year revenue growth rate of 23.9%, which beats out 77.7% of other semiconductor firms. Also, its FCF growth rate pings at an impressive 21% during the aforementioned period.",
			"Enticingly, the market prices AMAT at a forward multiple of 14.98. As a discount to projected earnings, Applied Materials ranks better than 66.42% of sector players. Also, it features a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:dividend yield;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amat/dividends\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dividend yield</a> of 0.92% and a low payout ratio of 13.2%, perhaps making it one of the blue-chip stocks with dividend growth. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg AMAT as a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:consensus moderate buy;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amat/forecast\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">consensus moderate buy</a>.

Throughout its history, Equinor converted natural resources into energy. Now, it’s embarking on a broader transition to support clean and renewable initiatives. Over the intermediate term, the bullish dynamics of the hydrocarbon market may lift EQNR. So far, though, EQNR gave up 13% of its equity value since the Jan. opener.",
			"Despite the turbulence, EQNR deserves consideration as one of the blue-chip stocks to buy now. Financially, the company benefits from robust stats. For instance, Equinor commands a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:cash-to-debt ratio;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/EQNR/summary?search=eqnr\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cash-to-debt ratio</a> of 1.22, above nearly 61% of sector peers. Operationally, it enjoys an impressive three-year revenue growth rate of 39.5%.",
			"Also, what makes EQNR a candidate for the best blue-chip stocks for 2023 is the value proposition. Currently, shares run a price-earnings-growth ratio of only 0.11 times. In contrast, the sector median stands at 0.76 times. To close out, analysts peg EQNR as a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:consensus moderate buy;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/eqnr/forecast\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">consensus moderate buy</a>.

First, let’s get address the giant pink elephant in the room. Due to worsening tensions between the U.S. and China, Taiwan Semiconductor operates in a geopolitical hotspot. Still, unless the Chinese government seeks to destroy its economy, it may play it cool regarding the breakaway island.",
			"Financially, the company surprisingly delivers the goods because of its massive importance to the global semiconductor supply chain. Notably, TSM’s three-year revenue growth rate comes out to 28.4%, ranked better than 83.28% of its peers. Also, its FCF growth rate during the same period lands at an impressive 53%.",
			"For all the heat, TSM is undervalued, making it one of the best blue-chip stocks for 2023. Presently, the market prices TSM at a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:forward multiple of 15.64;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/TSM/summary?search=tsm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">forward multiple of 15.64</a>, favorably below 64.18% of the industry. Looking to the Street, analysts peg TSM as a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:unanimous strong buy;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsm/forecast\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">unanimous strong buy</a>.

Primarily, the company’s headquarters are located in the U.K., making it less likely to be known by the average American. Also, Rio’s core industry – metals mining and extracting – isn’t the sexiest in the world now dominated by memes. Plus, since the Jan. opener, RIO slipped almost 13%.",
			"Taking the negativity aside, RIO makes for one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy for 2023 because of its core financials. Operationally, the company features a three-year revenue growth rate of 11.7%, outpacing 61.5% of its peers. On the bottom line, its trailing-year net margin stands at 22.31%, above 86.52%.",

With fears of the SARS-CoV-2 virus all but shriveled in the rearview mirror, nobody cares about the vaccine race. Well, I shouldn’t say nobody cares but the furor certainly subsided. Nevertheless, Moderna can leverage its acumen to develop more relevant solutions, making it a worthwhile idea.",
			"For its long-term potential, MRNA should rank among the blue-chip stocks to buy now. As well, the finances bolster confidence in the bullish view. Currently, Moderna features an Altman Z-Score of 8.09, indicating high fiscal stability and a low risk of bankruptcy. Operationally, its three-year revenue growth rate shot up into the stratosphere.",
			"Further, on the bottom line, the company prints a net margin of 44.3%, above nearly 96% of the competition. And it’s also technically undervalued, priced at only 6.76 times trailing earnings. On a final note, analysts peg MRNA as a consensus moderate buy.

			"Newmont shares rose 2% to $48.43 at 9:39 am in New York.",
			"The deal is key to Newmont’s efforts to extend its lead over other bullion mining rivals like Barrick Gold Corp.

Newcrest wants copper to make up more than 50% of revenue by the end of the decade, up from around a quarter now.",

Coal and natural gas took the lead in this decline, with the former declining by 34.8% and the latter falling by 27.2% over the same period. However, when it comes to price changes for non-energy commodities over this period, it was seen that there were minimal price changes. Food and beverage prices actually rose by 1% and 5.2%, respectively, while raw materials prices eased by 0.9%. Through all these price fluctuations, commodity stocks such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:XOM;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"http://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/exxon+mobil+corp/34088/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">XOM</a>), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:GOLD;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"http://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/barrick+gold+corp/756894/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GOLD</a>), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:CVX;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"http://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/chevron+corp/93410/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVX</a>) have gone through immense turbulence. Regardless, with commodity prices for some commodities still on the rise, these stocks remain well-placed to benefit in 2023.",
			"Such optimism surrounding the commodity sector is supported by the outlook for this sector in 2023. According to a Goldman Sachs <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:report;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/gs-research/2023-commodity-outlook-an-underinvested-supercycle/report.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> published in December 2022, commodities proved to be the best-performing asset class in 2022 despite price declines. By December, commodities had generated 20% returns, for instance. 2022 was the second year where commodities managed to perform this well since they generated returns of 42% in 2021 as well. Based on these trends, alongside European improvements in energy efficiency and slowing Fed rate hikes in the US, Goldman Sachs analysts expect the commodity sector to return 43% in 2023 as well.",
			"With price fluctuations where commodity prices often spike higher and the supply of commodities often not able to meet demand, a need to increase investment in the commodity sector has been identified by experts at Goldman Sachs. Higher commodity prices signal their scarcity, while the fact that commodities have been outperforming other asset classes signifies that investors should direct more capital into this sector. Greater capital is the only thing that can help raise the supply of commodities and rebalance the physical economy. The commodity sector has issued calls for capital in the past as well - first in the 1970s, then in the 2000s, and now in the 2020s.

			"Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.",
			"<b>Revisions to Earnings Estimates</b>",
			"Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.",
			"Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.",
			"For the current quarter, VALE S.A. is expected to post earnings of $0.62 per share, indicating a change of -29.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -24% over the last 30 days.",
			"For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.67 points to a change of -26% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -8.7%.",
			"For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.37 indicates a change of -11.3% from what VALE S.A. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -14.4%.",
			"Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, VALE S.A. is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.",
			"For VALE S.A. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $10.56 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -5.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $40.68 billion and $38.68 billion estimates indicate -7.2% and -4.9% changes, respectively.",

			"Over the last four quarters, VALE S.A. surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.",
			"<b>Valuation</b>",
			"Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.",
			"Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.",
			"As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.",

			"<b>Agnico Eagle Mines</b> (AEM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.",
			"Over the past month, shares of this gold mining company have returned +3.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Mining - Gold industry, which Agnico falls in, has gained 9.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?",
			"Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.",
			"<b>Revisions to Earnings Estimates</b>",
			"Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.",
			"Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.",
			"Agnico is expected to post earnings of $0.43 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -42.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +12.2%.",
			"For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.19 points to a change of -4.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +30.9%.",
			"For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.53 indicates a change of +15.5% from what Agnico is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +14.5%.",
			"Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Agnico is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).",
			"The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:",
			"<b>12 Month EPS</b>",
			"<b>Revenue Growth Forecast</b>",
			"While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.",
			"For Agnico, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $1.42 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -9.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $6.15 billion and $6.11 billion estimates indicate +7.1% and -0.6% changes, respectively.",
			"<b>Last Reported Results and Surprise History</b>",
			"Agnico reported revenues of $1.51 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.9%. EPS of $0.57 for the same period compares with $0.61 a year ago.",
			"Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.3 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +16.1%. The EPS surprise was +14%.",
			"The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.",
			"<b>Valuation</b>",
			"Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.",
			"Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.",
			"As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.",
			"Agnico is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.",
			"<b>Conclusion</b>",
			"The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Agnico. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.",

			"When the rest of the market is going through turmoil, gold is an asset that continues to survive. The asset is considered to be one of the best investments to hedge against inflation in the long run. In light of this, it is important for any good portfolio to have at least a few gold stocks to provide extra protection in economically volatile times.",
			"The price of gold has been rallying since November, when it stood at $1600 per ounce. By March, the price had risen to $1836 per ounce, and by April 27, it has risen even further to reach $1980 per ounce.  Such price rises contribute to the success of several gold companies, such as Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:GOLD;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"http://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/barrick+gold+corp/756894/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GOLD</a>), Newmont Corporation (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:NEM;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/newmont+corporation/1164727/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NEM</a>), and Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:KGC;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"http://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/kinross+gold+corp/701818/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">KGC</a>).",
			"According to a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:report;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://elements.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Gold-Outlook-2023.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> by the World Gold Council published in December, 2023 brings both headwinds and tailwinds for gold. However, at the end of it all, the report continues to believe there is a positive outlook for gold in 2023. History seems to have shown us that in times of mild recession and weaker earnings, gold tends to do well. According to the report, in five out of the past seven recessions, gold has performed well.",
			"Many investors are piling into gold as an investment, especially because most people think that inflation is not going anywhere anytime soon. This belief was translated into a near-record level high for gold by mid-April, when the price of the asset rose to $2055.3 per ounce on April 13. This hike represented an increase of about 13% year-over-year at the time. As evidenced by the price of gold on April 27, quoted above, the figure has since fallen, but it remains high nonetheless. This fluctuation in the price of gold merely goes to show investor attitudes towards the asset in light of fears that inflation may just be here to stay.",

			"Martin Marietta (MLM) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.16 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.99 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.39 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.",
			"This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 118.18%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this seller of granite, limestone, sand and gravel would post earnings of $3.03 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.04, delivering a surprise of 0.33%.",
			"Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.",
			"Martin Marietta , which belongs to the Zacks Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates industry, posted revenues of $1.35 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14.23%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.15 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.",
			"The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.",
			"Martin Marietta shares have added about 9.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.5%.",
			"<b>What's Next for Martin Marietta?</b>",
			"While Martin Marietta has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?",
			"There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.",
			"Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.",
			"Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Martin Marietta: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.",
			"It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $4.72 on $1.7 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $14.82 on $6.33 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.",
			"Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates is currently in the top 39% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.",
			"One other stock from the same industry, Eagle Materials (EXP), is yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2023. The results are expected to be released on May 18.",
			"This maker of gypsum wallboard and cement is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.35 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +23.7%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.",
			"Eagle Materials' revenues are expected to be $464.58 million, up 12.5% from the year-ago quarter.",

			"<span class=\"legendSpanClass\"><span class=\"xn-location\">BIRMINGHAM, Ala.</span></span>, <span class=\"legendSpanClass\"><span class=\"xn-chron\">May 4, 2023</span></span> /PRNewswire/ -- Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC), the nation's largest producer of construction aggregates, today announced results for the quarter ended <span class=\"xn-chron\">March 31</span>, 2023.",
			"<b>Financial Highlights Include:</b>",
			"<span class=\"xn-person\">Tom Hill</span>, Vulcan Materials' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"The powerful combination of our aggregates-led business and our commitment to execute on our strategic disciplines resulted in strong earnings growth in the first quarter.  Aggregates earnings increased sharply with cash gross profit per ton improving 23 percent and gross margin expanding despite lower shipments and persistent inflationary cost pressures.  As we look ahead, we are increasing our full-year earnings outlook to reflect the pricing momentum and solid execution realized in our first quarter results.  We now expect full-year Adjusted EBITDA of <span class=\"xn-money\">$1.850</span> to <span class=\"xn-money\">$1.950 billion</span>.\"",
			"<b><u>Segment Results<br/></u></b><b>Aggregates<br/></b>Segment gross profit increased 25 percent to <span class=\"xn-money\">$303 million</span> (<span class=\"xn-money\">$5.85</span> per ton).  Gross profit margin expanded 170 basis points due to strong pricing growth and solid operational execution.  Earnings improvement was widespread across the Company's footprint.",
			"Aggregates shipments decreased 2 percent. Shipments across the Southeast and East coast benefited from more favorable weather, while shipments in <span class=\"xn-location\">California</span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">Texas</span> were impacted by significant rainfall throughout most of the quarter.  First quarter volume also benefited from some shipments delayed by unfavorable weather in the fourth quarter.",
			"The pricing environment remains positive.  Pricing actions effective at the start of the year resulted in another quarter of accelerating price growth.  Freight-adjusted selling prices increased 20 percent, or <span class=\"xn-money\">$3.15</span> per ton, as compared to the prior year, with all markets realizing year-over-year improvement.  Adjusting for mix impacts, average selling prices increased 19 percent in the first quarter.",
			"Consistent with expectations, freight-adjusted unit cash cost of sales increased 18 percent, or <span class=\"xn-money\">$1.66</span> per ton, over the prior year.  Solid operational execution helped mitigate continued year-over-year inflationary pressures, particularly for parts and services.  The average price of diesel was 3 percent higher (<span class=\"xn-money\">$2 million</span>) than the prior year. ",
			"First quarter cash gross profit per ton improved 23 percent to <span class=\"xn-money\">$8.02</span> per ton.  The Company remains focused on compounding improvements in unit margins throughout the cycle through fixed cost leverage, price growth and operating efficiencies.",
			"<b>Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium<br/></b>Asphalt segment gross profit was <span class=\"xn-money\">$1 million</span> in the first quarter. Cash gross profit was <span class=\"xn-money\">$10 million</span> compared to <span class=\"xn-money\">$6 million</span> in the prior year.  Pricing increased 15 percent, or <span class=\"xn-money\">$9.38</span> per ton, and drove the year-over-year improvement in earnings.  The average unit cost of liquid asphalt was 7 percent higher (<span class=\"xn-money\">$4 million</span>) than the prior year.  Shipments decreased 11 percent as compared to the prior year's first quarter. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by lower shipments in <span class=\"xn-location\">California</span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">Arizona</span>, the Company's largest asphalt markets, due to significant rainfall in the quarter.",
			"Concrete segment gross profit was a loss of <span class=\"xn-money\">$2 million</span>, and cash gross profit was <span class=\"xn-money\">$18 million</span> in the first quarter.  Shipments decreased 30 percent as compared to the prior year.  Current year results were impacted by the divestiture of the Company's operations in <span class=\"xn-location\">New York</span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">New Jersey</span> and Pennsylvania.  Additionally, unfavorable weather in <span class=\"xn-location\">California</span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">Texas</span> and a slowdown in residential construction activity affected segment earnings. ",
			"Calcium segment gross profit was <span class=\"xn-money\">$0.8 million</span> compared to <span class=\"xn-money\">$0.7 million</span> in the prior year's first quarter.",
			"<b><u>Selling, Administrative and General (SAG)<br/></u></b>SAG expense in the quarter was <span class=\"xn-money\">$117 million</span>, or 7.1 percent of total revenues, a 60 basis-points improvement versus the prior year.  Trailing-twelve months SAG expense was 6.9 percent of total revenues.  The Company remains focused on further leveraging its overhead cost structure.",
			"<b><u>Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Allocation<br/></u></b>Capital expenditures in the first quarter were <span class=\"xn-money\">$113 million</span>, including both maintenance and growth projects.  In 2023, the Company expects to spend <span class=\"xn-money\">$600</span> to <span class=\"xn-money\">$650 million</span>, including growth projects.  The Company will continue to review its plans and will adjust as needed.",
			"On <span class=\"xn-chron\">March 31, 2023</span>, the ratio of total debt to trailing-twelve-months Adjusted EBITDA was 2.3 times (2.2 times on a net debt basis).  The Company remains committed to its stated long-term target leverage range of 2.0 to 2.5 times total debt to trailing-twelve-months Adjusted EBITDA.",
			"On a trailing-twelve-months basis, return on average invested capital was 13.7 percent, a 20 basis-points improvement from <span class=\"xn-chron\">December 31</span>, 2022.  The Company is focused on driving improvement through solid operating earnings growth coupled with disciplined capital management.",
			"<b><u>Outlook<br/></u></b>Regarding the Company's full-year outlook for 2023, Mr. Hill stated, \"We are increasing our full-year earnings expectations to incorporate the success of our pricing efforts during the first quarter.  Leading indicators of demand remain mixed, and full-year shipments for 2023 will still ultimately depend upon the depth of the decline in residential construction activity and the timing of highway starts converting to shipments.  Despite a challenging macro-environment, our uniquely positioned aggregates business and our best-in-class execution position us to successfully navigate shifts in demand.\"",

			"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Barrick's results presentation for the first quarter of 2023. Following today's presentation, a question-and-answer session will be conducted.Â (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this event is being recorded, and a replay will be available on Barrick's website later today, May 5, 2023. I would now like to turn you over to Mark Bristow, President and CEO of Barrick. Please go ahead, sir.",
			"<strong>Dennis Mark Bristow</strong>",
			"Thank you very much, and ladies and gentlemen, a very good morning to those here in Toronto and, of course, a good day to those around the globe. As you know, we're going to be talking about our results for Q1 2023 today. And I thought I'd start off by just pointing to the fact that as the different global powers seek to extricate the world from the many challenges and indeed, crisis, we currently have to contend with, we have a lot of talking, but don't see much action. Instead of fantasizing about some post-industrial idyllic state, the world's political and business leaders should perhaps be considering a better future for all, not just for the wealthy countries.Â <br/><br/>This requires, of course, investment in the development of sustainable enterprises driven by cleaner energy and extending to the many parts of the world. In fact, most of it, which have been left behind by the West's economics advances. Mining has historically been the catalyst for economic growth in underdeveloped countries. And I would argue that the case for investment in mining in those countries is stronger than ever, particularly as many are rich in the resources required to make the world a better place for all.Â <br/><br/>At Barrick, we have always been committed to investing in the future. And in the process, we have created some remarkable value for our broad base of stakeholders. I'll share a few instances of those with you in the course of this presentation. This is the usual cautionary statement, a copy of which can be found on our website, should you wish to study it more closely.Â <br/><br/>As guided at the start of the year, Q1 was a softer production quarter due mainly to the major planned maintenance exercises at Nevada Gold Mines and mine sequencing at Kibali. Free cash flow increased despite the lower production, while adjusted net earnings per share also increased to $0.14. Operational highlights included the near completion of the massive Pueblo Veaco expansion project, which I'll tell you more about later, a robust performance from Turquoise Ridge, and the delivery of the first production stopes ahead of schedule from the new Goncato underground mine.Â <br/><br/>All in all, we're in good shape to ramp up our performance throughout the year. And I would point out that we are not forecasting a hockey stick end but a stepwise move through the year. We also recently published our annual sustainability report. And if you haven't seen it yet, it's well worth a look, and it's on our website. Group operating results. This is a summary of those operating results, which lists the factors that impacted on production in quarter 1 and those that are expected to drive performance through the latter half of the year. This should ensure we achieve our gold and copper production within guidance as well as the cost guidance we provided at the start of the year.Â <br/><br/>Despite the lower production, our high-quality asset portfolio increased free cash flow and allowed us to maintain a $0.10 quarterly dividend, in line with our performance dividend policy. Our tax contribution report was also published last month, which highlights our significant contributions to the countries where we operate. As shared with you last quarter, we experienced 3 tragic fatalities in January. We've taken a long hard look at our safety protocols and practices. And during a weeklong group-wide workshop, we evolved a new approach, which we have called the Journey to Zero. Every one of our corporate and regional leadership teams have spent time at the operations, reinforcing our organizational values captured in our DNA and reminding ourselves that safety comes with caring and committed partnerships where we call on unsafe practices and stop work until we have a safe way to continue.Â <br/><br/>Subsequently, we have seen an encouraging decrease in the number as well as the severity of work-related injuries. But as I said, this is a journey we have just commenced and to which we are fully committed to achieving. And it's actually quite encouraging today, to the North American teams, including Nevada, they had their first injury-free April. So that's a good step forward. We've mapped that road to 0, and how you can see the very specific steps we're taking toward achieving that goal. This has been the single biggest focus for the entire company and remains our top priority, with a particular focus on creating a culture where everyone has the responsibility to stop unsafe work practices.Â <br/><br/>On the environment front, there was no Class 1 environmental impacts during the quarter. Our water use efficiency rate was again above the 80% target, and our greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 18% quarter-on-quarter. We have continued investing in our communities through our community development committees and embarked on an educational partnership journey with Tanzania, amongst others. On the biodiversity front, the first white rhinos are expected to arrive in the Democratic Republic of Congo soon as part of our mission to restock the species in the country's Garamba National Park, a UNESCO-world heritage site, which we've long supported. As I mentioned earlier, we've just published our 2022 sustainability report, and you can see some of its highlights here. It's worth noting that during the year, we spent $6 billion on goods and services with local suppliers and invested some ZAR 36 million in community development projects in line with our philosophy of partnering with our host countries.Â <br/><br/>Moving to the operations. As usual, I'll start the operational review with North America, which, as I've said before, we regard as our value foundation. From our base in Nevada, we've started looking at the potential Tier 1 hosting regions elsewhere in the United States as well as in Canada, with the complex work of combining 2 sets of assets and people accomplished a new leadership in place and a bankable 15-year business plan, the vision we had for Nevada Gold Mines can now be fully realized.Â <br/><br/>In Q1, production at Carlin was impacted, as I've already said, by the planned conversion of the autoclave through a carbon and leach process, plus the planned maintenance of the Goldstrike roaster. The focus is now on improving stability and throughput. At Cortez, the emphasis remains on ramping up the Goldrush project, where the record of the decision is now expected in the second half of this year. There is no significant impact anticipated for 2023 production, and the potential impact to 2024 and onwards is being reviewed.Â <br/><br/>Turquoise Ridge's performance continued to improve on the back of the first full quarter of production from its recently commissioned third shaft. In Nevada, the safe and efficient drilling ramp-up this quarter returned robust intercepts across all the Tier 1 districts, delivering further resource growth in support of our 15-year plan. With slow receding from the higher ground and a very long winter, we are planning to build on our success at Fourmile by stepping out around the recent Dorothy discovery. As I said last quarter, this is a very exciting area where we continue to discover thick and continuous high-grade mineralization, which we expect will materially enhance the existing Fourmile resource.Â <br/><br/>At Turquoise Ridge, drilling continues on extensions of the BBT resource as well as testing between the megapit and the hunt for our high-grade feeder. And on the Carlin trend, bold step-out drilling between Level and Goldstrike is intersecting strong and continuous alteration and local high-grade mineralization worthy of follow-up. Elsewhere, as I pointed out in the beginning, in North America, our exploration is opening up new frontiers, and we've started building a significant presence there. In Western Nevada's Walker Lane mineral belt, we've secured the Pearl String property through an exploration agreement and additional claims taking.Â <br/><br/>In Montana, we've staked 100 square kilometers of claims where we've identified a potential target area for both copper and gold. And we are working on other opportunities in other prospective regions in the Western United States. In Canada, we are progressing the PEC project near Hemlo, relogging its historical core to guide modeling and targeting. Also in Canada, we've signed a binding term sheet with Midland Exploration to earn up to 75% of the purchased property in Southern Abitibi.Â <br/><br/>We move now south to our Latin American and Asia Pacific region, which had a busy quarter highlighted by the progress at Pueblo Viejo, a prime example of successful value creation by Barrick. And of course, the exciting new Reko Diq project is starting to take shape, which I'll touch on in a little more detail, and I'll update you on our stepwise move towards restarting the Porgera project. At the time of the merger in 2019, you would recall,Â Pueblo Viejo, a Tier 1 mine, was rapidly nearing the end of its life despite its enormous resources. It simply didn't have the tailings storage capacity to process him.Â <br/><br/>We are investing around $2 billion on a 100% basis in expanding and upgrading the operation. And after a long and considered engagement with the Dominican government and the community around the mine, we have identified a site for a new tailings storage facility. The new plant was more than 90% complete at the end of the quarter, and we've started an aggressive commissioning program in April targeted to be fully complete in line with our plan during July.Â <br/><br/>As a reminder of what I have said in the past, the existing storage facility can cope with the tailings until 2027, when the new one will have been completed. The project will extendÂ Pueblo Viejo's Tier 1 life by at least 20 years at an average annual production rate of more than 800,000 ounces per year. And its success is a tribute to the partnership between management, our host country, and the surrounding communities. Management also deserves credit for keeping the mine operating efficiently despite the inevitable disruptions caused by construction and the tie-ins.Â <br/><br/>Veladero made a promising start to the year, but as I'm sure you all appreciate, Argentina has a worsening currency crisis and import restrictions, a change in fiscal policies almost monthly. And as a result, the operating environment is becoming increasingly difficult. We continue to work constructively with the San Juan provincial governor and his government to try and find solutions for the longer term. Our planned headcount optimization and the higher gold price have somewhat mitigated the operation's negative projections for this year, but there's still a lot of work to be done on the cost profile and the resource expansion to ensure Veladero's long-term success. We have had some recent success with our exploration programs around the operation, most notably at the Morro Escondido target, and we continue to extend the system through drilling.Â <br/><br/>A generative exploration review of Central and South America continues to refine key focus areas where ground consolidation is progressing as planned. 5 drill-ready targets in the Austral project in Peru are moving up our resource triangle. And as I've mentioned, we're testing some targets around Veladero as part of our life of mine extension strategy. A high-level project study on the Pascua-Lama project is also scheduled for completion later this year.Â <br/><br/>Moving across the globe. In Pakistan, the updated feasibility study on the Reko Diq project is scheduled for completion by the end of next year, with the first production expected in 2028. In the meantime, our social investment program has started with the rollout of the first Community Development Committee and a drive to bring schooling to the region. The first school was inaugurated at the Hami Village, which will provide education for children from the community. And we're also very proud of the fact that the enrollment of the first students was done on a 50%Â (inaudible)Â and 50% goal basis, which is a significant step forward in that region. The reconstruction of the runway at the site, which is now complete, will improve access and reduce the need for road transport.Â <br/><br/>And the selection of a project engineering partner for the project, both for the feasibility study and later on design and construction, is nearing completion, and some key definition studies are now up and running. As I indicated earlier, and as you may have seen in the press, a new progress agreement was signed in March between Barrick New Guinea Limited, the Papua New Guinea government, and New Porgera Limited. New Porgera Limited has initiated the steps to apply for a new special mining lease, which is a key step to the reopening of the mine. There's currently a lot happening as we progress towards getting this mine up and running.<br/><br/>Back across to Africa and the Middle East. This region finished well ahead of planned gold production for the quarter, setting the scene for another year of strong delivery. As I've said before, if North America is our value foundation, then Africa and the Middle East region is foundational to Barrick's performance. In Mali, Loulo-Gounkoto produced its usual robust performance with the new Gounkoto underground mine, making its first contribution ahead of schedule. Loulo's 40-megawatt solar power expansion project continues to advance, with the commissioning of the first phase expected by the end of this year. And when complete, it is slated to reduce carbon emissions further by a further 63,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.Â <br/><br/>The Loulo Flame district, which straddles the border between Mali and Senegal, remains highly prospective, and all key structural corridors in the region are being reviewed in the search for the next world-class discovery. At Bambadji and Senegal, drilling has started on priority targets along the 26-kilometer main share zone. And at Loulo, initial drilling on the Gare West corridor has confirmed the potential for a significant but largely untested mineralized structure.Â <br/><br/>Across the continent, in the DRC at Kibali, production was in line with planned sequencing and planned maintenance. Grades are forecast to improve from this quarter as development opens up access to new stopping fronts, improving underground flexibility. Like Loulo-Gounkoto, Kibali has a high potential for major discoveries, as has been shown in the past. Exploration continues along the principal mineralized corridor, which still hosts multiple opportunities. Targets currently being advanced include potential underground satellites at Mengu Hill and Warren and new mineralized systems between the KCD Garamba and the Kombokolo Ore bodies.Â <br/><br/>And in Tanzania, we have another success story. You may recall that when we took over there a few years ago, these mines were derelict, burdened by major social and environmental liabilities, and with operators despised by the entire country. In very short order, we reinvented the mines, which now between them deliver a Tier 1 production profile, formed a groundbreaking benefit-sharing partnership with the government, and settled the legacy issues. The potency of Barrick's Stakeholder Relations and impact is demonstrated by our recent commitment to invest $30 million in partnership with the government to extend and improve the country's educational infrastructure.Â <br/><br/>Also during the past quarter, our growth initiatives in the Africa and Middle East region focused on expanding our footprint in all its Tier 1 districts, as shown on this map, and optimizing our exploration to deliver high-impact discoveries within our existing portfolio. We are reviewing new operational frontiers in West Africa, delivering new projects in Saudi Arabia, and we are developing multiple exploration opportunities across East and Central Africa for both gold and copper.Â <br/><br/>Talking about copper, I turn now to our copper operations, which, as you are aware, we are on track to deliver significant expansions. At the time of the merger, Lumwana in Zambia was a doubtful starter. But like PV and the Tanzanian mines, we have transformed it almost beyond recognition. The Super Pit pre-feasibility study, which includes a potential new mill expansion and tailings storage facility, is advancing and scheduled for completion next year. This project could extend the mine's life into the 2050s and elevated to Tier 1 status. In the meantime, we've also reinvigorated our copper belt exploration leadership and begun the transition to an owner-operator fleet for waste stripping at Lumwana, which should deliver a significant cost reduction.Â <br/><br/>In Saudi Arabia, in conjunction with our joint venture partners, Ma'aden and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we have received an exploration license for the nearby Uma Demar permit in addition to the Jabal side South permit, and initial field work has started on both these prospects. The 2019 merger was designed to create a business that would deliver sector-leading returns. And as you can see from this comparison with the GDX and spot gold, we've outperformed these benchmarks. Step by step, we have worked to deliver on our strategy that we shared with the market back in September 2018, with just about every objective we outlined then having been fulfilled.Â <br/><br/>Today, I'm immensely proud of where we have got to, although we still have a lot more to do with the proven ability to replace the reserves we are mining, we are not reliant on M&amp;A to grow. Our new projects on the horizon should see us grow our production profile, and this affords us the luxury of focusing on our organic initiatives while being able to choose external opportunities when they arise. I believe we have passed an important milestone this quarter on our journey to become the world's most valued gold and copper miner. As I've often said, mining is a long-term game, and the foundation we have laid will ultimately be reflected in the full value of the company.Â <br/><br/>So ladies and gentlemen, to finish off my presentation, how some of the key reasons for investing in Barrick. We own what are indisputably the best assets in the business. We have a clear and proven long-term strategy, which we execute with disciplined effectiveness. We consistently invest in our future. Our existing mines support a 10-plus-year production profile, which our organic growth projects will enhance. Our reserves are constantly replenished by our successful exploration programs, which include exploring worldwide for our next major discovery. And finally, we are a leader in sustainability, and our actions in this field produce measurable results that benefit all our stakeholders. In short, at Barrick, we do as we say, and I thank you for your attention, and we'll be happy to take questions starting, I believe, with this people in this room. Thank you, Las.",
			"<strong>Lawson Winder</strong>",
			"Mark, thank you so much for the presentation today. Nice to see you. I wanted to ask you about some statements you made in an article interview from back in March. I was with S&amp;P. And you made the comment that M&amp;A should only be pursued if the target is stressed. And I wanted to get your idea as to what that stressed means. And further to that point, what type of M&amp;A makes sense to Barrick today?",
			"<strong>Dennis Mark Bristow</strong>",
			"Yes. So I can't remember that. I'd want to admit about, but it makes sense. So we ever said it. But the point is that, I've always said there are 2 reasons you buy companies. And that is if they're really good assets or they are -- it's a company that has those really good assets and is badly run or inefficiently run. And as you know, and you've seen repeatedly during these times of higher commodity prices and less options, any asset that's half decent gets a big multiple on it. So then you start making a decision not against the asset but your view of the gold price or the assumption the gold price is going to continue going upwards. I mean, everyone in this audience knows that doesn't happen. The gold price goes up and down, not necessarily in that order.Â <br/><br/>And so it does get them down to the synergies and whether you have the ability to add to the opportunity that you're pursuing. And there's an interesting graph we were talking with the exploration team yesterday. If you take -- and I've shown this before, and we can share to you still on our website. But if you look at Barrick in its hay days, its early days, and Randgold Resources, through its entire life, all the M&amp;A we did, and we both did M&amp;A, came with a significant increase in reserves, material expansion on the drill bit and a classic one is Kibali, which had 5 million ounces. We've mined 10, and we've got 10 left. I mean, that's value creation. We bought Loulo with 0.5 million ounces and we've delivered -- we've mined also around 10, and we've got 10 left or more than 10. So 22 million ounces on the back of that first 0.5 million ounces.Â <br/><br/>Tongon, we discovered, Morila, discovered. And the classic one is Goldstrike. When Barrick bought Goldstrike, I think they bought like 3 million ounces, and it's produced 33 million ounces. So those are the debates that we have. And if you're really looking to create value rather than gamble, that's the opportunity. And as you know, there's different views in Canada about how to create value. Some people say you can only grow through M&amp;A. And I very clearly say you create value -- the way you create values through the drill bit, adding ounces. Buying them doesn't create value. It might increase your production. And again, if you take some of our peers and you listen to their messaging, and you take my messaging, it's all about sustainable profitability, so then it's about how do you -- what's the acquisition target and what does it do to your profitability?Â <br/><br/>Because that's our focus, grow value and not just growth. And a classic example is if you look at our series of transactions in 2019, they were very strategic, driven off the back of a 2.5-year engagement, thorough due diligence, we came out in September 2018 with a clear set of deliverables, including people. If you take Newmont's acquisition of Goldcorp, it was purely opportunistic. And so that's the difference. And I'm not trying to pick on anyone, but there's a different strategy or there's a different business philosophy in one, and there's a very clear business strategy when it comes to Barrick. And so when it comes to M&amp;A, as you know, we have worked and looked at everything that's been put in the market. And we've also looked at many that haven't been put in the market. And we haven't very recently done any. But when you look at the Tanzanian deal and the Nevada deal, that happened very quickly because they fitted all our filters easily.Â <br/><br/>And that's the way we'll continue to do it. And very clearly, as you go like -- and this is like 2011. Gold price up, no one's invested. No one's got exploration teams, and so you have to buy. And the people who make the money are the sellers. And so we're -- that sort of doesn't fit our business. You can go to the second one.",
			"<strong>Lawson Winder</strong>",
			"Yes. I was going to ask one follow-up, and it's Lawson Winder from BofA Securities, by the way. Around the same time, you made a comment that you wanted to see copper grow to 30% of the profitability of the business. I think it's sub-20% right now. So I'd also love to get your thoughts on what are the elements that drive that potentially beyond just the Lumwana super pit.",
			"<strong>Dennis Mark Bristow</strong>",
			"So again, that's a -- thank you for that question because if you go back in in 2018, we were very clear that if you want to be relevant in this public market of mining, as a gold miner, you're going to have to grow and include copper in your portfolio. And we didn't do it because it's suddenly a fad and somebody is trying to make lots of batteries. We identified it as a very strategic method, as strategic as gold is precious. And so we set out to build that. And the growth sits in Jabal Sayid. We've increased the production there by 50%. It's a completely different mine to what it was in 2019. We've grown its footprint materially with these last 2 deals in a real partnership with Saudi Arabia, where it's 50-50, and we are the operators in a formal structure. And that's not common in Saudi. And of course, you've seen us working with Saudi, and we've spoken a lot about the opportunities that that partnership will bring further into South Asia.Â <br/><br/>And then Lumwana, we looked to sell it initially. By the time we had our first look at it very quickly, I mean, we dropped the mining cost by 50%. And we found a whole lot more pounds in satellite deposits. And what those do is they slightly hire very low strip ratio, they allow us to keep building the profile and strip back the main ore bodies, the 2 main ore bodies. And so that's the sexy part of Lumwana, and that you can keep the money -- you can finance that big expansion rather than go into another negative capital debt. And then, of course, you've got Reko Diq. And Reko Diq is a world-class deposit. It brings both gold and copper production in an organic way. We haven't bought it. It was paid for a long time ago as an early-stage project by Barrick and Antofagasta. But we've now got 50% instead of less than that because it was a shared asset. We're partnering with the country. It's opening up a whole new exploration frontier for us.Â <br/><br/>So when you just take that and Lumwana, Lumwana will be the equivalent of our 50% share of the 2 phases of Reko Diq as far as contribution. Lumwana, of course, we have 100%. So you take that, and you take our projects in Saudi Arabia, those are all very attractive and make a big contribution taking us towards that. And if you go back and blend it as a gold equivalent, by the time we get to the end of this decade, just on what we've got, not on what we could get. We increased our gold equivalent production by 20%. And so that's material in this mining industry organically. And as you've seen, we have more ounces today than we started with when we did the first combination, 3 combinations in 2019.Â <br/><br/>And that is significant as well in that we are not forced to buy our future production. We've been able to sustain it. We've got more than a 10-year horizon. And again, the geologists were working through us this week, and we've got -- we can show granularity of replacement of the total resource we mine out 5 years now as we've extended our knowledge of our known ore bodies. And all we need -- and we run the risk of finding something now because our geologists are well embedded in these regions. And I would finish by saying on top of that, exploration, which very few people in our mining industry really comprehend anymore, is also a key for mineral intelligence in proper organically driven M&amp;A because you've now got people -- Barrick has 700 geologists, Joel? 200 geologists across the group, that's just exploration, not MRM.Â <br/><br/>And in the field, they are highly skilled, they're commercially savvy, and that's another strategic advantage which will materialize with time because it takes time to build that intellectual capital, which is effectively what exploration is. Do you want to say something?",
			"<strong>Joel Holliday</strong>",
			"Yes. Just to reiterate what we said at our Investor Day in November, we get to 30% copper organically through those 2 projects that Mark talked about in terms of the super pit and Reko Diq by the end of the decade. So we get there without doing M&amp;A.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Marcus Greg Barnes from TD Securities.",
			"<strong>Greg Barnes</strong>",
			"You've talked a lot about Argentina and how difficult it is to operate there. And you did mention your comments in your presentation that you're trying to work with the government to help things along. What kind of initiatives can you actually move forward there to.",
			"<strong>Dennis Mark Bristow</strong>",
			"So in the governor's office in San Juan, I think we've really built a strong relationship. And as you can imagine, it's been difficult because the Argentinian political structure at the moment is completely modeled, and so we've got that stability, but he still relies onÂ (inaudible)Â for the allocation of dollars. And so we spend an audit amount of time with like the governor of the Central Bank, trying to explain to him, so governor, do you need dollars? \"Yes, that's exactly what we need.\" So we actually print dollars for you. So that loop hasn't completed yet, because what happens is he agrees, but the problem is the central bank is not independent in Argentina. So then some politician in the federal government makes decisions. And it's all about -- and we've seen -- I mean, I'm in Africa, and I've lived through these crises. I mean, Zimbabwe is probably the best, but we've lived through a number of these. And so when you get into that spiral, and I always say, actually, Argentina would do well without the government because it's got all the ingredients of a significant economy. It's got a massive agricultural industry. It's got a mining industry and some oil, and it's got tourism, all dollar-based.Â <br/><br/>But for some reason, people -- and so this is a year of electioneering. What we've done, as you've seen, is we've cut back Veladero. We've cut back on people. We've worked with the governor of the province to create employment positions. So we just haven't arbitrarily cut back, but we've taken nearly 2,000 people out of Veladero. We've delayed the capital into next year. And at the same time, through our construction royalty programs, we've worked with the province to ensure employment on provincial infrastructure programs. So we've been constructive, and the business -- and we've, of course, invested in people, we continue to do that. And it's a different place today, and it's running the risk of being cash flow positive this year because we made those decisions.Â <br/><br/>And so we keep -- we haven't got and mined in an irresponsible way. You remember Julian Barry used to say, \"If you can't mine gold at a profit, leave it in the ground.\" And so that's really our philosophy in Veladero. We're mining the gold in a proper disciplined way, in a profitable way. We are continuing -- we haven't stopped exploring because that's the future and the value creation. And again, I go there off in every quarter. And the frustration is at such a great country with really good people. It's got all these ingredients. And politically, it's just in a mess.",
			"<strong>Greg Barnes</strong>",
			"Maybe a question for Graham. Can you get cash out of Argentina currently?",
			"<strong>Graham Patrick Shuttleworth</strong>",
			"I can answer that, yes. So we do, and we can, and we negotiate that. But I'll give you an example. And also, as you've noticed, we keep gold in this bulk. So we manage the gold because you don't want to sell the gold and end up with passos that you can't spend. So we really use gold as the ultimate currency. And with the approval of the government, but that in itself doesn't really get anyone out of trouble. And then on top of that, I'll just give you some of the latest regulation is when you buy something offshore, you can only pay for it 180 days later. Now for small companies, that's toxic. For Barrick, we've got a big balance sheet. We've got strong partnerships on the supply side. We can manage that working capital pipeline. But inevitably, it's going to really strangle the mining industry in Argentina.",
			"<strong>Greg Barnes</strong>",
			"Just a question taking on to Lawson's, and you have quoted this morning about not being interested in Tech Metals but is the competition for copper resources, copper mining companies just too intense and not something that you can compete in?",
			"<strong>Dennis Mark Bristow</strong>",
			"I think we've got lots of competitive advantages, Greg, as you know, particularly in emerging markets. But again, every potential transaction to Lawson's first point is different. And Tech is not a super producer, but it does have some assets. It's got a really good stake in a partnership in Peru. It's got old legacy assets here in Canada. It's got the new, what's it? QB2 in Chile, and it's got coal. And it's got a lot of debt. So when you look at that structure and Glencore's of intervention, there has been interesting because what Glencore offers that we don't have is synergies, opportunities to really create value. And so I think -- well, I know, from our side, given the current situation, there is no logic for us to get involved in anything like that because we don't have coal. We don't like that, and the synergies in Chile with the Glencore Anglo assets are very real. We don't have anything to offer. But at the same time, we're finding it very interesting to follow the debate because it really is indicating where our industry has got to, given that we haven't invested in our future. Anybody else want to ask a question? Can you ask the post to explain the track to ask questions?",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"We will now begin the telephone question-and-answer session.Â (Operator Instructions)Â The first question comes from Cleve Rickert with UBS.",
			"<strong>Cleveland Dodge Rueckert</strong>",
			"Mark, I just wanted to go back. I know you always sort of take the long view, and we appreciate the long-term sort of multi-decade managerial focus. But I really noticed in the press release the -- sort of a little bit of a tilt towards some of the near-term operational work that you're doing on the assets and the improvement that I think you talked about that step-wise increase on quarterly production volumes now throughout the year as the result of the work that you did in the first quarter. And I'm just wondering if -- as we look into 2024 and 2025, there is growth in the plan for both of those years. Should we expect now just that step-wise improvement in volumes to continue through 2025? Or will there continue to be some seasonality in the business as you take maintenance opportunistically or cloud plan?",
			"<strong>Dennis Mark Bristow</strong>",
			"So let's just deal with the first this year. This year, we're looking at roughly 45, 55. If you take the 4.4 million ounces attributable production first half, second half, roughly. The drivers of that are -- and there's no sudden finish in quarter 4. And I'll just take you through the drivers. So Carlin, we expect to step up in quarter 2. Cortez will be -- you saw a proven quarter-on-quarter. It will be similar in quarter 3. All the rest are already at run rate in Nevada. And then quarter 3 and quarter 4, Carlin and Cortez will be really at a good place operationally. And also, I think a lot of you will understand this. When you do these big transactions, particularly big multiple assets. And we have to get the people right first. And also, remember, it's partly unionized, and we've just done -- we just completed a big CBA negotiation, which is, again, just tells you we bring a different philosophy to these things because the union is working alongside nonunion people. That's a big step in the United States because it's very clearly understood they work for us, but they're represented by their union.Â <br/><br/>And also, we've changed management because we've moved from a more controlled strategy as we've merged the organization. And remember, it was 4-day weeks for management in Newmont. The Newmont assets were behind on their plans. Barrick was obsessed with cash flow and high grading. So culturally, they were different, and also, operational culture was different. And so we brought all that back. And now it's a case -- and I've done this so many times, and when you're climbing the hill, it's like it's tiring. And you have challenges. And slowly, you build a habit, and then you get the habit right. And then you'll see it becomes -- and I mean you guys will -- some of you have worked through it with Kibali when we ramped it up, Loulo as well. None of the mines we started had sort of straight out the block perfect.<br/><br/>And so we're at that stage now, and we've now changed the management as per the Barrick or stroke Randgold model in that we flattened that GMs run the mines, not somebody in the corporate. We build strong people around them. We've got very good GMs now in Nevada. And it's taken some time to build some capacity around. And they are in their own right back. So running it centrally is not -- and I don't like doing that anyway. So now we've got a much better flatter structure. And also, we've had to deal with neglected capital and maintenance. And remember, it was a hostile transaction. So we took it as it came. And we're getting to the point now where we're comfortable with our processing facility. It's still process constrained. Because as we go underground, we go more to double refractory ore. So we're expanding the gold quarry roaster, which was the highest cost, most inefficient of the 2 roasters.Â <br/><br/>And so with that, that really grows our profile, as you point out, in Nevada over the next couple of years, gently, but it's an improving profile. And then PV is a big step up back to above 800,000 ounces. And we go straight there almost this year. And what's nice is the front end of -- just to remind you, what we've done there is we've expanded the front end, jacked up our -- put in a concentrator. And really, on that basis, we've kept the autoclave feed the same. But we've changed the whole temperature management in the autoclave, so it can take higher fuel. And we're definitely seeing sort of a 10%, 12% increase in throughput in the autoclaves. And the SAG mill we've put in is enormous. So we've built some flexibility into that operation to be able to -- it's a bit like Kibali, where you can catch up.Â <br/><br/>Whereas in Nevada, it's always, unless we've got oxide ore, or heap leach, or the refractory flow sheets is really your bottleneck. And the way we're building flexibility for Nevada now with the new team is we're building some extra flexibility underground because that's the way you do it. And so you open up some ore stocks underground with a little bit more grade in it. And then you manage that so that when you have an unplanned shutdown, you can start up and feed high-grade ore for a while and tidy it up. But then you need to invest in, and that's what we've been doing is putting in that extra flexibility. So those are the drivers that take us to the better second half. And Kibali was the other soft producer this quarter. And that was because we -- at the end of last quarter, remember that quarter 4 was a higher production quarter, and we fed on our stockpile, the high-grade stockpiles from Kibali. So we're building that backup. And then you'll have a very steady run rate for the last part of the year for the last 3 quarters.Â And when I say it's a different profile to what you've seen this previous couple of years as we stabilize the organization. And AME, as you know, as I said, it's pretty flat.",
			"<strong>Cleveland Dodge Rueckert</strong>",
			"Yes, that makes sense. And I would say that the work that you've been doing over the last 3 years, maybe it's not clear to everyone and you're getting tired of talking about it, but we're looking forward to...",
			"<strong>Dennis Mark Bristow</strong>",
			"No, no. I never get tired of talking about it because that's what makes -- and I'll just add a little bit you hadn't asked the question, but again, you look at our policy around dividends, everyone, I mean these last 3 years, we've had the market calling for dividends, Everyone's been paying dividends and then suddenly what. And now you see people still paying dividends outside their dividend policy because the markets being in the table saying, I want some dividends, and we didn't get caught up in that sort of vogue. And our balance sheet is in good shape. And the dividends there, as we promised, and we can afford it. And we'll pay it, and we bought shares back when the share price was down, not when the share price was relatively high, like some of our colleagues or our peers. So you can see the difference in the way we run our business compared to a lot of others in this industry. And that's because we are owners, first of all, as management. And if you -- and I don't have to try and make people owners because they are. So it's a different approach. And we do have a long-term horizon.Â And I tell you, we will get opportunities. And one thing you can be sure about is when the right opportunity arises, it will happen.",
			"<strong>Cleveland Dodge Rueckert</strong>",
			"I wanted to ask just one quick follow-up on Porgera. And I appreciate that you are waiting for the mine lease to get approved. What happens after that? I mean, what are -- just quickly, what are the key milestones? Do you have an export license in place? What needs to happen to get Porgera sort of back into guidance and up and running?",
			"<strong>Dennis Mark Bristow</strong>",
			"So the big one knows ASML, that's what was taken away and issued to Kumon back 3 years ago. But we've all got our head around what needs to be done, and that's the process. We will start the mine up on thermal power as the backup power. We are working with the Hella province to restart the gas power station and hello, that's really what makes -- Porgera is a low-cost high production when it comes to gold project. And apart from that, we have still -- so we have agreed the scope of the shareholding that the landowners get. That has to be ratified through a development forum, but it's not -- it doesn't hold the production up.Â <br/><br/>The production -- the restart is all around the SML. The operator agreement, which we've got, I think, 3 points left on it. And there are a couple of the mine development agreements, is it Mine Development Contract, I think it's called MDC. That's also a document that has to be completed. And we are now working towards -- we've done all the sort of review of all the mobile fleet so that they're operational because we can -- we've cleaned out all the mud from the mine. We're continuing to do that. We have a fleet of trucks in Australia that are sort of very secondhand, but close to new, that we have kept offshore, which we'll bring onshore as we finalize the structure. And that will help with the mining. And then we're doing some rehab on the tankage, the CIL tankage and slowly inching our way to be operationally ready when the SML is approved and get the fine.Â <br/><br/>And we're working hand in glove with the government and the MRA, the Mineral Resources Authority. And the other big thing is we're just over 1,000 people unemployed now, we are employing people, and that's one of the big critical parts is getting enough people and up to run it. And dealing with the security around the mine, which is a government thing, and I think we've all landed on that now. But Papua New Guinea is a tough place to operate.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Tanya Jakusconek with Scotiabank.",
			"<strong>Tanya M. Jakusconek</strong>",
			"Mark, can you just give me an update as to what's happening with the Goldrush permit? It seems to be getting delayed quarter-over-quarter. So I'm just trying to understand what exactly is keeping up the delay. And then just looking at the mine tour that we did in September, I thought Nevada, that portion of Nevada's old mine production. I think Goldrush was going to be about 100,000 ounces this year on 100% and moving higher to commercial production in 2026. I thought it was about 400,000 ounces or thereabouts. Can you kind of give me an idea of, A, what's happening with the obtaining the permit and B, what sort of production profile was scheduled to come in '24-'25 that could potentially be impacted?",
			"<strong>Dennis Mark Bristow</strong>",
			"Yes. So this is the challenge of doing business in the United States, a lots of good things about it, but permitting is not one of them. And so there's been some 9-circuate court decisions around permitting just recently. We are not impacted by that in any legal fashion. But again, the BLM have slowed the process down. What I can say is that we've got a very good constructive working relationship with them. We're back on engaged and the EIA is right at a point where it's nearly ready to go to Washington, if it hasn't already got there at the moment, but that is delayed.Â <br/><br/>And as I said in my speech, right now, the delay we can manage. We're still guiding around 1 million ounces, 950 to just over 1 million ounces for Cortez. And Goldrush is embedded and in Cortez, and we manage it that way. And we are looking at whether, if this goes beyond this year, we have had some relief under our hiccup permit, which is the project exploration permit under which we're doing trial mining at the moment. And so that's -- right now, we're looking at where is the critical path and how can we manage and not compromise the infrastructural development and be able to deliver on our long-term plan for Cortez and Goldrush is embedded in that plan, Tanya. So as I said, we are looking at it, we'll let you know. But right now, we have enough flexibility in our operations. And I think that as I've touched on earlier, that's the big thing that I see in Nevada, that it's taken time to put the working capital in to build the flexibility.Â <br/><br/>Kibali is a 750,000 ounce producer. It's got lots of flexibility because it's embedded in the business. Same with Loulo, but Nevada never had that, and we are doing that. And I think the fact that we're saying to you the rod is delayed. We're not sure exactly when we do expect it to be this year. But at this stage, we've got flexibility to manage it. That's a new development in Nevada.",
			"<strong>Tanya M. Jakusconek</strong>",
			"Okay. And so am I correct to think of that $950 million to 1 million ounces at 10,000 of it is Goldrush?",
			"<strong>Dennis Mark Bristow</strong>",
			"No. It's variable. I think Goldrush will slowly grow to your 400,000 ounces and maybe even higher as we develop it. But we're still learning about those breaches. But right now, the 1 million ounce profile for Cortez is built on what we have banked in the Goldrush project. But we're still exploring. We're still expanding. We're still learning as we drill out the ore bodies. And the nice thing about this is Carlin at $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, quarters, I mean, it should settle out above 1 million ounces, which is a big shift. You can see. It's never been there. It was there a long time ago, but not recently. And then you've got 500 going to 600, maybe a little bit higher in Turquoise Ridge and then you've got Phoenix.Â So that's what grows our profile gently over the next 2, 3 years in Nevada, as we've shown you.",
			"<strong>Tanya M. Jakusconek</strong>",
			"Okay. I think I'll move off that. And just I've got 2 other projects. I just wanted to ask an update on if you could, Mark, can you give us an update on what's happening at Donlin Gold in terms of what you're seeing there and what your focus is for this year and longer term?",
			"<strong>Dennis Mark Bristow</strong>",
			"So we focused on what we shared with you in quarter 4. Actually, it was quarter 3 last year after our annual September trip. And that is very specific work streams on revisiting and optimizing certain work streams. And one is, of course, the water management and ensuring that we address the issue around protecting the fish in the water way. The second one is the trade-offs that we on power because currently, the plan is to bring gas from a gas field that really hasn't been developed on a gas pipeline that doesn't have a road next to it. So there's work to do on that trade-off. We are doing a series of metallurgical tests and trade-offs on the flow sheet because it's a double refractory ore and whether we can improve the recoveries.Â <br/><br/>And is there another way to process this also? That's part of the trade-off. We've gone back to the mining and the mine schedule as we've improved our knowledge of the ore bodies and now looking at bench heights and equipment sizing and then we can get our head around the costs. And another one is limestone because as you know, when you've got autoclaves, you need limestone. And there's always been talk of calcium carbonate rocks in the area that we need to just check if they are actually usable or where is the closest source of limestone. So there's a couple of these things that could materially change the project. We have also worked hard with our partners because remember, this is owned by the native Alaskans. And both the people who own the surface rights and the mineral rights, but also the whole of all the native Alaskans will benefit from this project. So that's where we are. We are working towards the next review workshop in September again. And after that, we'll be able to update the market. But I just want to assure you that we see this as a significant resource, and we are putting the necessary effort into it to try and get it into a reserve on Barrick's set of filters.",
			"<strong>Tanya M. Jakusconek</strong>",
			"And you can get that as a reserve when Mark, do you think?",
			"<strong>Dennis Mark Bristow</strong>",
			"I don't know. I'm still working on it, Tanya.",
			"<strong>Tanya M. Jakusconek</strong>",
			"Okay. We'll wait for the update then later this year on all of those factors that you're looking at. And if I could just ask, you mentioned high level study coming at the end of the year on Paspalama. Can you just remind me what's happening there, sort of...",
			"<strong>Dennis Mark Bristow</strong>",
			"So we were instructed to -- basically, the project that was originally conceptualized and designed had a lot of issues, critical issues the way it was designed, et cetera, and also social issues. And when I assumed the role here in Barrick, we went to the government, and we said, let's deal with this because we were lighting up for a fight. And so we agreed to go down and put that permit to beg, just the construction permit. So a lot of the stuff like trenches that put the water or expose the water, some of the stockpiles that were being blown all over the place, and there's a whole lot of other infrastructure. And so we are busy closing those. We're very close to completing that.Â <br/><br/>At the same time, the exploration permit is still very much intact. And so what we've done is we've embarked, and we did some drilling last year, and we've shown that a substantial part of the resource can be processed through standard leaching and/or agitated leach. And so we can do that. We can change the circuit that's already built in the Lama infrastructure. So that's what we've been looking at. And we want to take it to a point where we can demonstrate a potentially viable project, which we can then take back to the governments of the Chile and Argentina and point out the opportunity and then work to get a permitting process going to be able to drill out the model and take it from there. That's where we're going. And I think it's our responsibility to do that to ensure that those countries understand there's value in this, both infrastructure and the resources.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Martin Pradier with Veritas Investment Research.",
			"<strong>Martin Pradier</strong>",
			"I want to know, when I look at the cost increases that you have this quarter, there was 16% year-on-year on gold and over 40% on copper. So what gives you confidence? What are the 2, 3 things that give you confidence that you will be able to maintain the cost flat year-on-year?",
			"<strong>Dennis Mark Bristow</strong>",
			"So Martin, it's all in the production, as you know. So we had a soft quarter, so the costs were up because the production was down. And on a unit basis, that drives all-in-sustaining costs. With the pickup, as I pointed out, if you've got 45% of this sort of 4.4 million ounces, middle of guidance. And then you're going to increase your production to 55% of that. It drives costs, and that's really the biggest driver. Do you want to add to that, Graham?",
			"<strong>Graham Patrick Shuttleworth</strong>",
			"No, that's spot on. I mean, if you look at the delta in production from Q4 to Q1, you were down about 15%, and costs were up 15%. So there's a very strong correlation there.",
			"<strong>Dennis Mark Bristow</strong>",
			"You get that, Martin?",
			"<strong>Martin Pradier</strong>",
			"Yes. If you look at the volumes, we're down 9% compared to Q1 last year.",
			"<strong>Dennis Mark Bristow</strong>",
			"Back forward quarter 1.",
			"<strong>Graham Patrick Shuttleworth</strong>",
			"So you can't really look at Q1 last year because that was pre the inflationary pressure that we were experiencing post the Ukraine crisis. So if you remember, last year, we started the year with a $65 oil price assumption. 2022 landed up being close to $100 of actual oil price, and that drove significant inflation through the business last year. This year, when we look at our assumptions for some of those key inputs, we're using assumptions that are based on prices that are very similar to what we actually experienced in 2022. So really, the Q1 of last year isn't a relevant comparison quarter.",
			"<strong>Martin Pradier</strong>",
			"Okay. But you would say that this is in line with what you're expecting, the cost of the Q1 or it was higher than expected.",
			"<strong>Graham Patrick Shuttleworth</strong>",
			"Yes. So it's in line because as we indicated at the start of the year, we expected this first quarter to be the weakest quarter, and so we expected costs to be highest in this first quarter. And then as the production steps up, we expect the costs to come down. And as we've reiterated, we expect to meet both our production and cost guidance metrics for the year.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Mike Parkin with National Bank Financial.",
			"<strong>Michael Parkin</strong>",
			"Most of them asked and answered, but just a follow-up on Nevada. It sounds like you're doing a lot of good things in terms of getting the management in place that you want. In terms of the more general labor force, how are you tracking relative to filling jobbing and just any kind of overall commentary around the Nevada Gold Mines employment scenario. Is it still a bit challenging like it is in some of the other areas of the world? Are you finding it easing and you're getting closer to 4 employment plans?",
			"<strong>Dennis Mark Bristow</strong>",
			"So I mean, we made, as you know, a while back, made a strategic decision to not continue to chase ever-decreasing ever aging traditional mining skill pool and to go and invest in younger engineers and skills. And we've been extremely successful in that endeavor. And we've started a focused process, multiple set of processes to ensure that we give those young people the skills and the experience that is needed to go into the workforce. And part of that is I think we had -- they are in 50 job phase or job engagements. What do you call them? 110 this last year or this last quarter? Quarter. Yes. We had 50 job fairs this last quarter. And it's interesting, nearly 50% of young graduates that have joined us this last quarter have never -- didn't know what mining was about until they came for an experience at Nevada.Â <br/><br/>At the same time, we've enhanced our Compass program for like geologists and mineral resource managers and planners and that sort of thing. We now have 3 mining schools or mining training centers. We train for underground. We train for open pit and we're training process. So because United States doesn't have a trade type mentality. So a lot of our skilled people come from the army or have just learned sort of a diesel mechanic skill, but they don't actually -- they're not trained. And so when we bring in those people, we can train them. And it's also part of our initiative to standardize all standard operating procedures across the Nevada business. And I was there just 10 days ago, I spent just over a week there, and we visited these schools.Â <br/><br/>And the other thing that struck me for the first time, you're getting 35-year-old, 40-year-old new recruits coming back to work. They're from another industry. So the first signs we're seeing of a tightening labor market. Those are different to the people we're actually targeting, which is the young skills. And again, we've gone all engineers, all financial people. We don't try and go to a mining school because you get a good civil engineer, and we've been extremely successful in attracting young people. I think we've employed about 100 young graduates per month the last 3 months. So just in Nevada. So -- and again, the way we've slowly changed our organogram within Nevada, we are now refreshing our planned headcount because -- so I can tell you that the turnover has reduced materially like, I want to say, 20% Yes.Â <br/><br/>And also, now we're saying, okay, we've been operating at plan for a long time as we change the way we operate and how we manage people and more efficient. I mean, we've done some interesting things like introduced childcare from 4:00 in the morning to 8:00 at night. We're looking at multiple people for one job, particularly in the driving side. We're looking at being innovative because -- and it's driven by our commitment to be Nevadan focused as far as employment goes. And again, our percentage of Nevadans and our workforce are significantly up. And I would just -- and so is our local purchase. I mean 80% of all our purchases are now Nevada-based. When I first arrived here, there was like 20%.<br/><br/>So a lot of effort in that. I'm not answering it in real numbers, but as we progress this, but we've certainly got all the arrows pointing in the right directions. And one thing I can tell you is that people that say that young 22-year olds to 26-year-olds haven't got ambition is untrue. And we've got -- and there's a lot -- I mean, we've just employed some of the top students out of the British Columbian universities for Nevada because we went and got them. And so we are seeing and we're excited about that potential because that also will change the way we operate. because that -- I'll give you an example. You take a 50-year-old mining civil engineer or an electrical engineer and ask him to do AI or data lytics. He struggles. Get a 24-year-old young graduate in any one of the engineering fields that they've, it's part of their cost. They're good at it. So that's where this world is going. And just accessing the data points on a big 300-tonne tracked, we've been able to improve our efficiencies. And it's not just about being AR-savvy. You've got to have the full engineering skill to be able to apply it in our industry anyway.",

			"There are no more questions from the conference call.",
			"<strong>Dennis Mark Bristow</strong>",
			"All right. Thank you very much, everyone. Great seeing you again. And we'll be catching up with some of you during the next while. And again, I'd just say the team is always available. We are going to see some of you down in Dominican Republic, I believe. So we look forward to that.

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!",
			"We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Simply Wall St analysis model;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://github.com/SimplyWallSt/Company-Analysis-Model/blob/master/MODEL.markdown#discounted-cash-flow-dcf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Simply Wall St analysis model</a>.",

			"We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.",
			"Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:",
			"<i>(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)</i><br/><strong>Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF)</strong> = US$19b",
			"The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.7%.",
			"<strong>Terminal Value (TV)</strong>= FCF<sub>2032</sub> × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.6b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.1%) = US$66b",
			"<strong>Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)</strong>= TV / (1 + r)<sup>10</sup>= US$66b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)<sup>10</sup>= US$32b",
			"The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$51b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$60.0, the company appears about fair value at a 16% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.",
			"Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Corteva as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.934. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.",

			"<strong>Opportunity</strong>",
			"<strong>Threat</strong>",
			"Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

			"<strong>First-Quarter Highlights</strong><br/><em>(Financial highlights are for continuing operations)</em>",
			"<br/>",
			"Ward Nye, Chairman and CEO of Martin Marietta, stated, “Our year is off to a remarkable start with record first-quarter results by nearly every measure including continued world-class safety incidence rates. The cumulative effects of our 2022 and January 1, 2023 pricing actions drove robust margin expansion despite continued inflationary pressure and modestly lower aggregates shipments. Importantly, we achieved a quarterly record for aggregates pricing growth and a 134 percent increase in aggregates gross profit per ton, highlighting our team’s steadfast execution of our value-over-volume commercial strategy.  <br/>",
			"“We continue to see solid near-term product demand reinforced by healthy customer backlogs across our coast-to-coast footprint, led by infrastructure and heavy nonresidential projects of scale. We expect recent legislation and the resulting enhanced level of public investment in these kinds of aggregates-intensive end-use projects to support continued strong demand for several years to come. While single-family residential construction has slowed, builder sentiment has improved in Martin Marietta geographies as the single-family housing shortage continues to drive a base level of demand in our key Sun Belt markets. We also expect to see an uptick in residential activity as mortgage rates stabilize over the next several months.",
			"Mr. Nye concluded, “We are confident in our ability to continue to expand margins throughout the year and expect to deliver compelling full-year financial results more directionally in line with the high end of our previously announced 2023 guidance range, which we will revisit at mid-year. Moreover, Martin Marietta’s track record of success throughout various business cycles proves the resiliency and durability of our aggregates-led business model and our ability to successfully navigate a wide array of macroeconomic environments to consistently deliver superior value for shareholders.”",

			"<em>(All financial and operating results are for continuing operations and comparisons are versus the prior-year first quarter, unless otherwise noted)</em>",
			"<strong>Building Materials Business</strong>",
			"The Building Materials business generated record first-quarter revenues of $1.27 billion, a 10.1 percent increase. Gross profit increased 99.4 percent to a first-quarter record of $275.9 million. Double-digit pricing gains, partially offset by continued inflationary pressure, resulted in gross margin improvement of 970 basis points.",
			"<strong><em>Aggregates </em></strong>",
			"First-quarter aggregates shipments decreased 0.8 percent, largely due to historically wet weather in California, which was partially offset by mild weather and strong demand in the Southeast. Pricing increased 22.6 percent, or 12.8 percent sequentially, due to the cumulative effect of 2022 and January 1, 2023 pricing actions.",
			"Aggregates gross profit increased 131.7 percent to a first-quarter record of $238.1 million. Similarly, gross margin expanded 1,250 basis points to a first-quarter record of 26.1 percent, as strong pricing growth more than offset modestly lower shipments and increased costs.",
			"<strong><em>Cement</em></strong>",
			"Despite continued robust demand, cement shipments decreased 6.8 percent to 1.0 million tons, primarily attributable to wet and cold weather in Texas. Pricing increased 32.2 percent in the first quarter, a record for Martin Marietta, aided by largely sold-out conditions and the compounding effect of price increases in 2022 and 2023.",
			"Cement gross profit increased 75.4 percent to a first-quarter record of $47.1 million. Gross margin increased 860 basis points to 28.0 percent, as pricing gains more than offset lower shipments and higher raw materials and maintenance costs.",
			"<strong><em>Downstream businesses</em></strong>",
			"Ready mixed concrete revenues and gross profit declined 24.4 percent and 48.9 percent, respectively, driven largely by the divestiture of the Company’s Colorado and Central Texas ready mixed concrete businesses on April 1, 2022.",
			"Asphalt and paving revenues increased 2.1 percent to $58.0 million and, consistent with the Company’s historical first-quarter trends, the business posted an overall loss of $20.5 million due to seasonal winter operational shutdowns in Minnesota.<br/>",
			"<strong><em>Portfolio Optimization </em></strong>",
			"On April 26, 2023, the Company terminated its agreement with CalPortland Company (“CalPortland”) regarding the sale of the Company’s Tehachapi, California cement plant and related distribution terminals to CalPortland in light of the parties being unable to timely obtain the necessary approval by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.  The Company intends to explore the potential sale of Tehachapi to other buyers. On May 3, 2023, the Company divested its cement import operations in California. Since October 1, 2021, these cement businesses were classified as assets held for sale on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet; the associated financial results continue to be reported as discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of earnings.",
			"<strong>Magnesia Specialties Business</strong>",
			"Magnesia Specialties revenues increased 8.4 percent to a first-quarter record of $83.4 million, driven by higher pricing for all product lines. Gross profit declined 2.7 percent to $25.0 million as higher supplies and contract services costs adversely impacted the quarter.",
			"<strong>Cash Generation, Capital Allocation and Liquidity</strong>",
			"Cash provided by operating activities for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 was $160.5 million compared with $169.9 million for the prior-year period.",

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Thus, you can purchase PPG Industries' shares before the 9th of May in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 12th of June.",
			"The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.62 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$2.48 per share to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that PPG Industries has a trailing yield of 1.8% on the current share price of $138.34. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether PPG Industries can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.",
			"<span class=\"veryHighlightLink\"><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Check out our latest analysis for PPG Industries;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nyse-ppg/ppg-industries?blueprint=2492152&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=cta&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Check out our latest analysis for PPG Industries </a></span>",
			"If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. That's why it's good to see PPG Industries paying out a modest 45% of its earnings. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Dividends consumed 64% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.",
			"It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.",
			"Click <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nyse-ppg/ppg-industries/dividend?blueprint=2492152&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=integrated-pitch&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.</a>",
			"Companies that aren't growing their earnings can still be valuable, but it is even more important to assess the sustainability of the dividend if it looks like the company will struggle to grow. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. It's not encouraging to see that PPG Industries's earnings are effectively flat over the past five years. It's better than seeing them drop, certainly, but over the long term, all of the best dividend stocks are able to meaningfully grow their earnings per share. Earnings per share growth has been slim, and the company is already paying out a majority of its earnings. While there is some room to both increase the payout ratio and reinvest in the business, generally the higher a payout ratio goes, the lower a company's prospects for future growth.",
			"Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. PPG Industries has delivered 7.7% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years.",
			"From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid PPG Industries? PPG Industries has struggled to grow earnings per share, and it's paying out less than half of its earnings and more than half its cash flow to shareholders as dividends. To summarise, PPG Industries looks okay on this analysis, although it doesn't appear a stand-out opportunity.",
			"So while PPG Industries looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. Case in point: We've spotted <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:1 warning sign for PPG Industries;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/materials/nyse-ppg/ppg-industries?blueprint=2492152&amp;utm_medium=finance_user&amp;utm_campaign=conclusion&amp;utm_source=yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>1 warning sign for PPG Industries</strong></a> you should be aware of.",

Forward-looking statements and other estimates also involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Corteva's control. While the list of factors presented below is considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results as compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Corteva's business, results of operations and financial condition. Some of the important factors that could cause Corteva's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements include: (i) failure to successfully develop and commercialize Corteva's pipeline; (ii) failure to obtain or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals for some of Corteva's products; (iii) effect of the degree of public understanding and acceptance or perceived public acceptance of Corteva's biotechnology and other agricultural products; (iv) effect of changes in agricultural and related policies of governments and international organizations; (v) costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements and the effect of actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements; (vi) effect of climate change and unpredictable seasonal and weather factors; (vii) failure to comply with competition and antitrust laws; (viii) effect of competition in Corteva's industry; (ix) competitor's establishment of an intermediary platform for distribution of Corteva's products; (x) impact of Corteva's dependence on third parties with respect to certain of its raw materials or licenses and commercialization; (xi) effect of volatility in Corteva's input costs; (xii) risk related to geopolitical and military conflict; (xiii) effect of industrial espionage and other disruptions to Corteva's supply chain, information technology or network systems; (xiv) risks related to environmental litigation and the indemnification obligations of legacy EIDP liabilities in connection with the separation of Corteva; (xv) risks related to Corteva's global operations; (xvi) failure to effectively manage acquisitions, divestitures, alliances, restructurings, cost savings initiatives, and other portfolio actions; (xvii) failure to raise capital through the capital markets or short-term borrowings on terms acceptable to Corteva; (xviii) failure of Corteva's customers to pay their debts to Corteva, including customer financing programs; (xix) increases in pension and other post-employment benefit plan funding obligations; (xx) capital markets sentiment towards ESG matters; (xxi) risks related to pandemics or epidemics; (xxii) Corteva's intellectual property rights or defend against intellectual property claims asserted by others; (xxiii) effect of counterfeit products; (xxiv) Corteva's dependence on intellectual property cross-license agreements; and (xxv) other risks related to the Separation from DowDuPont.",

Where, in any forward-looking statement or other estimate, an expectation or belief as to future results or events is expressed, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and expectations of Corteva's management and expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished. Corteva disclaims and does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, except as required by applicable law.

			"This earnings release includes information that does not conform to U.S. GAAP and are considered non-GAAP measures. These measures may include organic sales, organic growth (including by segment and region), operating EBITDA, operating EBITDA margin, operating earnings (loss) per share, and base income tax rate. Management uses these measures internally for planning and forecasting, including allocating resources and evaluating incentive compensation. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures best reflect the ongoing performance of the Company during the periods presented and provide more relevant and meaningful information to investors as they provide insight with respect to ongoing operating results of the Company and a more useful comparison of year over year results. These non-GAAP measures supplement the Company's U.S. GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as an alternative to U.S. GAAP measures of performance. Furthermore, such non-GAAP measures may not be consistent with similar measures provided or used by other companies. Reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures to U.S. GAAP are provided in the Selected Financial Information and Non-GAAP Measures starting on page A-5 of the Financial Statement Schedules.",
			"Corteva is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to its most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, as it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty items outside of the Company's control, such as Significant Items, without unreasonable effort. For Significant items reported in the periods presented, refer to page A-8 of the Financial Statement Schedules. Beginning <span class=\"xn-chron\">January 1, 2020</span>, the Company presents accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense as a significant item. Accelerated prepaid royalty amortization represents the non-cash charge associated with the recognition of upfront payments made to Monsanto in connection with the Company's non-exclusive license in <span class=\"xn-location\">the United States</span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">Canada</span> for Monsanto's Genuity® Roundup Ready 2 Yield® and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® herbicide tolerance traits. During the five-year ramp-up period of Enlist E3TM, Corteva is expected to significantly reduce the volume of products with the Roundup Ready 2 Yield® and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® herbicide tolerance traits beginning in 2021, with expected minimal use of the trait platform after the completion of the ramp-up. The Company also committed to activities relating to the 2022 Restructuring Actions, which are expected to be completed in 2023. The total net pre-tax restructuring and other charges expected to be recognized during 2023 are not expected to be material.",
			"Organic sales is defined as price and volume and excludes currency and portfolio and other impacts, including significant items. Operating EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) (i.e., income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes) before interest, depreciation, amortization, non-operating benefits (costs), foreign exchange gains (losses), and net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, excluding the impact of significant items. Non-operating benefits (costs) consists of non-operating pension and other postemployment benefit (OPEB) credits (costs), tax indemnification adjustments, and environmental remediation and legal costs associated with legacy businesses and sites. Tax indemnification adjustments relate to changes in indemnification balances, as a result of the application of the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement, between Corteva and Dow and/or DuPont that are recorded by the Company as pre-tax income or expense. Operating EBITDA margin is defined as Operating EBITDA as a percentage of net sales.",
			"Operating earnings (loss) per share is defined as \"earnings (loss) per common share from continuing operations - diluted\" excluding the after-tax impact of significant items, the after-tax impact of non-operating benefits (costs), the after-tax impact of amortization expense associated with intangible assets existing as of the Separation from DowDuPont, and the after-tax impact of net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Although amortization of the Company's intangible assets is excluded from these non-GAAP measures, management believes it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in amortization of additional intangible assets. Net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting represents the non-cash net gain (loss) from changes in fair value of certain undesignated foreign currency derivative contracts. Upon settlement, which is within the same calendar year of execution of the contract, the realized gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of the non-qualified foreign currency derivative contracts will be reported in the relevant non-GAAP financial measures, allowing quarterly results to reflect the economic effects of the foreign currency derivative contracts without the resulting unrealized mark to fair value volatility. Base income tax rate is defined as the effective tax rate excluding the impacts of foreign exchange gains (losses), non-operating benefits (costs), amortization of intangibles (existing as of the Separation), mark-to-market gains (losses) on certain foreign currency contracts not designated as hedges, and significant items.",

The broadcasting via Internet, both the audio and the slide change has a few seconds delay in relation to the audio transmitted via phone.",
			"Before proceeding, let me mention that forward-looking statements are being made under the Safe Harbor of Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1996. Actual performance could differ materially from that anticipated in any forward-looking statements comments as a result of macroeconomic conditions, market risks, and other factors. With us today are Mr. Eduardo De Salles Bartolomeo, Chief Executive Officer; Mr. Gustavo Pimenta, Executive Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations; Mr. Marcello Spinelli, Executive Vice president of Iron Solutions; Mr. Carlos Medeiros, Executive Vice President of Operations; Ms. Deshnee Naidoo, Executive Vice President of Energy Transition Materials. First, Mr. Eduardo Bartolomeo will proceed with the presentation on Vale's first quarter 2023 performance.",
			"And after that, he will be available for questions and answers. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Eduardo Bartolomeo. Sir, you may now begin.",
			"<strong>Eduardo Bartolomeo:</strong> Thank you very much, good morning, everyone. I hope you are all doing well. We started 2023 with great confidence in delivering our goals for the year. In Iron Solutions, iron ore production was solid, especially at S11D, thanks to a better performance of our truckless system and the installation of new crushers in 2022. In addition, our pellet production increased by 20% year-on-year, with higher feed availability and improving asset reliability in our pelletizing plants. On iron ore sales, the gap to production was primarily due to weather restrictions in loading at our Northern port and a supply-chain rebalancing after strong sales in the fourth quarter of last year. Since production was not affected, we expect to offset this impact in the second half of the year.",
			"In this sense, our average iron content and quality was slightly lower, impacted by the port restrictions and opportunistic sales of low-grade product, which add value to the company. In Energy Transition Metals, copper production grew over 18% year on year, supported by Salobo III start-up, and with sales up to 25%. Finished nickel production was impacted by the ongoing transitional period between the depletion of Ovoid mine and the full ramp-up of Voisey's Bay. On a very high note, our Sudbury mines continue to deliver remarkable performance, with record ore production rates since 2017. Also, we continue to make progress on the EV supply chain, with two important milestones for Pomalaa and Morowali, in Indonesia, which I will cover later.",
			"Moving on to sustainability, we are steadily making progress with our dam safety management. This year, we upgraded our dam safety management. This year, we upgraded the safety levels of two more dams, removing their emergency protocols. Our improvements in Health and Safety practice led to renewed perception by ESG rating providers. On that, Sustainalytics completed its annual review on Vale in March, with a substantial upgrade in our ESG risk rating. On top of that, our discipline in capital allocation remains pristine. We are walking the talk and returning value to shareholders. In March, we distributed $1.8 billion in dividends while completing 47% of the third buyback program launched since 2020. So, let's see our performance in detail in the next slide, please.",
			"We are well positioned to deliver the production guidance for iron ore. We already produced 4 million tons more than in the same period of last year, and we expect to continue with that steady performance as the seasonal challenges fade away. In the Northern System, asset availability increased at S11D, with lower non-scheduled maintenance and solid production output. The achievement aligns with our intensive efforts to standardize processes and ensure adherence to best operational practices. In the Southern and Southeastern Systems, the heavy rains did not prevent us from delivering a strong production, contrasting with what we experienced last year. The loading restrictions mentioned caused the production-to-sale gap and the lower average grade which are temporary, and we should be able to compensate it in the second half of the year.",
			"In addition, we are close to obtaining the operating license for Torto Dam, since we had its emergency plan approved in March. The dam will support pellet quality and volume, as well as product mix and average price premium. Another project that is moving well is the commissioning of Gelado, which will produce high- quality pellet feed by reusing the tailings that have been deposited in the Gelado dam. In this context, we are confident that we will reach our volume guidance and average grade for the year 2023. Next slide, please. In Iron Solutions, tests in clients' furnaces are confirming the benefits of iron ore briquettes. We shipped the first cargo for international tests in April. So far, 8 industrial tests and 6 furnaces are under execution, with another 9 tests expected this year.",
			"Our first two industrial plants will startup this year in Tubarão. I believe we are facing unprecedented opportunities for segmentation and demand growth for high-quality. Concentration is key to a high-quality low-carbon supply, reason why we signed up for the development of Mega Hubs in the Middle East and launched the green briquette. Therefore, Vale is uniquely positioned to be the supplier of choice in that scenario. We combine volume, quality, innovative portfolio, and well-structure supply chain for a decarbonizing world. Next slide, please. In the Energy Transition Metals business, I call your attention to our copper production growth, up 18% year on year, which allowed for a sales growth of 25% year-on-year. This was mainly the result of Salobo III ramp-up and Sossego's improved asset availability, benefiting from the extended SAG mill maintenance in 2022.",
			"In Nickel, Sudbury delivered the highest production in the past 5 years, following another production record in the last quarter, due to the excellent performance of our Sudbury mines. As I mentioned before, the lower finished production for the quarter was expected, and was mainly due to the ongoing transitional period between the depletion of Ovoid mine and the production ramp-up of Voisey's Bay. For the second quarter, we have planned maintenance for Voisey's Bay and Long Harbour operations as well, which should impact Voisey's Bay and Thompson production. Next slide, please. As I said, we are steadily ramping up Salobo III. Both lines are operating, which is an important milestone for the site. We expect to reach full capacity within 20 months, with a relevant contribution to production by the end of 2023.",
			"christina-wocintechchat-com-FVgECvTjlBQ-unsplash",
			"Once at peak capacity, Salobo III will add 30 to 40 thousand tons of copper per year. As you can see in the picture, this is a beautiful set for a promising project and a natural hub for copper production in Brazil, with substantial value creation for shareholders and society. With all that, we are confident on both guidance for Copper and Nickel this year. Next slide, please. We continue to engage with clients and partners in the EV supply chain. We are setting the stage to pivot in Nickel. In that direction, together with our Chinese partner, PTVI signed a definitive agreement with global automaker Ford Motor Company for the Pomalaa HPAL project development in Indonesia. The three-party collaboration fosters conditions for a more sustainable nickel production in Indonesia.",
			"We also launched the project construction in Morowali, in February. This an integrated nickel mining and processing plant powered by natural gas, with start-up expected in 2025. As you can see, we have unique assets, innovative technology, customer engagement, and a supply chain to be the supplier-of-choice for the EV revolution. With active listening and open dialogue, we have set the stage for the strong growth ahead of our Energy Transition Metals business. Moreover, we continue to make significant progress on several fronts, including on the minority sale, and today I am happy to announce that we have advanced on bringing Mark Cutifani as the Chairman of our newly formed Energy Transition Metals Board, starting July this year. Mark needs no introduction, and we are certain he will be a valuable partner as we bring our tier-one portfolio of assets to the next level, unlocking significant value to our shareholders.",
			"Next. We are moving safely towards leadership in sustainable mining. That starts with reducing the risks associated with dams. Since 2022, our approach allowed 10 dams to be stated safe and stable by external independent reviewers. With that, those geotechnical structures had their emergency level removed. By August, we are on track to be adherent to the GISTM, the Global Industry Standard for Tailings Management for critical structures. That gives us confidence that we will be 100% compliant by 2025 to all other structures. With more robust safety practices, the ESG risk perception on Vale improved considerably. The company has been re-rated by important ESG risk raters, with Sustainalytics providing the latest grade improvement for our company.",
			"That decision came with an assessment of critical controversy and improved practices in Health &amp; Safety, putting Vale in the industry 1st quartile. We are seeking leadership in sustainable mining. For that, we continue to deliver on many of our public commitments, such as in Human Rights, Amazon Forest protection, and community relations. Finally, on Brumadinho reparation, we reached 59% of commitments delivered per the conditions and deadlines set by Integral Reparation Agreement. Next slide, please. There is one thing I make sure to emphasize every single time. We substantially de-risked and reshaped Vale. On the de-risking, we had strong deliveries in dam management and decharacterization, besides advancing with the Brumadinho Reparation.",
			"On the reshaping, we simplified our business in a major way. We divested from more than 10 businesses in 5 different countries, tapping cash drains and allowing ourselves to laser-focus on our core business, on safety and on production stability. The last milestone, to finally say we completed the Reshaping Program, is the divestment from MRN. We moved a lot in building Vale of the future, a company that promotes sustainable mining, fosters low-carbon solutions, and remains disciplined in allocating capital. Now, I pass the floor to Gustavo, who will give you more detail about our financial results. I'll get back at the end for our Q&amp;A session. Thank you.",
			"<strong>Gustavo Pimenta:</strong> Thanks, Eduardo, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with our EBITDA performance for the quarter. As you can see, we delivered a $3.7 billion proforma EBITDA in Q1, $2.7 billion lower than in Q1 2022. This decrease is mainly explained by $1.5 billion lower price realization for iron ore fines. On volumes, we had an impact of $574 million from lower sales of iron ore fines, which was down 5.5 million tons year-over-year, despite a 3.7 million tons production increase. This is a transitory effect due to loading restrictions at Ponta da Madeira Terminal during the rainy season and supply chain rebalancing after strong sales in Q4. We expect to offset this impact in the second half of the year, keeping the annual sales plan unchanged.",
			"The $435 million increase in costs and expenses will be detailed later in my presentation. So back to Iron Ore price realization. Iron ore fines realized price was $108.6 per ton, 23% or $32.8 per ton lower when compared to Q1 2022, mainly due to the decline in benchmark price of $16.1 per ton. Our average premium also contributed to lower price realization as our average sales quality was impacted by the temporary shipment restrictions at Ponta da Madeira Port and the opportunistic sale of high silica products, as discounts for these products were low due to steelmakers negative margins. The pricing mechanism had a negative impact of $ 2.4 per ton on our final realized price. This is largely explained by the negative effect from realized lagged prices at $96 per ton which was partially offset by the better sales prices in the quarter as compared to the provisional prices accrued in Q4.",
			"Moving to our cost performance in the next slide. As you can see, our C1 cash cost ex-third-party purchases increased to $23.6 per ton in the quarter. This is explained by three main factors. First, one-off events, which include profit sharing in Q1 and the anticipation of maintenance activities, taking advantage of the lower volumes in the first semester. Second, the volume mix and inventory effect. The lower production from our Northern System, where we have the lowest C1, together with higher third-party purchases, had a negative effect on volume mix and fixed cost dilution. We expect these transitory effects to be normalized in the year to go. The remaining impacts were related with the geological inflation in Serra Norte and higher fuel costs in our operations.",
			"We remain confident in achieving our C1 guidance for the year of $20 to $21 per ton, mainly due to the production recovery in the Northern System and the roll out of our productivity program, with gains in asset reliability and procurement initiatives with suppliers. Moving to all-in cost in the next slide. As you can see at the bottom of the table, our EBITDA breakeven cost reached $58.2 per ton. Besides the C1 cash cost increase, which I just explained, there were 2 other drivers. First, our distribution cost, which increased by $1.5 per ton, mainly due to higher share of beneficiated products in third-party concentrators, improving returns and margins and second, lower market pellet premiums. As we reduce our C1 cost and improve the average quality of our portfolio, with higher production from Carajás and more pellet feed production in Minas Gerais, we expect our breakeven to improve in the year to go.",
			"Now, turning to Energy Transition Metals Business, starting with copper all-in costs. There was a year-over-year decrease in cost of goods sold per ton due to higher fixed cost dilution, largely attributed to the improved operational performance at Sossego. This was offset by a decrease in our by-product revenue due to higher proportion of copper concentrate from Sossego. Also, benchmark treatment and refining charges have increased this year. All in all, our EBITDA breakeven excluding Hu'u reached $4.464 per ton, which should gradually reduce throughout the year as we continue to ramp up production at Salobo III. Now looking at nickel all-in costs, cost of goods sold ex-third party was impacted primarily by lower dilution of fixed costs and inflationary pressure, including higher fuel costs.",
			"In addition, volumes from third-party feed increased year-on-year, as we had anticipated. Although this increases our costs, it is aimed at maximizing the utilization and performance of our downstream operations, especially as Voisey's Bay open pit is depleting and we progress on the ramp up of the underground mine. Now moving to cash generation. As you can see, we delivered a 62% EBITDA-to-cash conversion in the quarter, compared to 19% in Q1'22. Free cash flow generation was positively impacted by working capital as we had a strong cash collection from Q4 sales, as we anticipated last quarter. This effect was partially offset by transitory inventory build-up and seasonal disbursements related to profit sharing in the first quarter. We also paid around $1.8 billion in dividends and repurchased almost $800 million in shares in Q1, aligned with our capital allocation strategy.",
			"So let me talk more about our capital allocation strategy and more specifically about our buyback program. We are close to reaching 50% completion of our third buyback program, and we expect to conclude it in Q4. We continue to see the repurchase of our shares as one of the best ways to create long-term value for our shareholders. After the completion of the third buyback program, we will have repurchased almost 20% of the company's outstanding shares. This means that for our shareholders with positions since the start of the program, without spending any additional dollar, their participation in future earnings would have increased by almost 25%. So, before opening up for questions, I would like to reinforce the key takeaways from today's call.",
			"As Eduardo mentioned, we are very encouraged with the leading indicators coming out of our key operational sites and the solid operational performance in Q1 only reinforces we are moving in the right direction. We are also focused on delivering value through accretive growth projects, such as Salobo III, levering on Vale's unique endowment. On portfolio redesign, we are happy with the progress to-date and strongly believe the current portfolio of assets and the recently announced organization will position us to successfully deliver on our key strategic objectives. And finally, we remain highly committed to a disciplined capital allocation, as evidenced by our highly accretive buyback program. Now I would like to open the call for questions.",
			"Thank you.",

			"Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Nutrien (NTR) reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.",
			"The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 10, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.",
			"While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.",
			"<b>Zacks Consensus Estimate</b>",
			"This producer of potash and other fertilizers is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.54 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -43%.",
			"Revenues are expected to be $6.17 billion, down 19.4% from the year-ago quarter.",
			"<b>Estimate Revisions Trend</b>",
			"The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.94% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.",
			"Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.",
			"<b>Earnings Whisper</b>",
			"Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).",
			"The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.",
			"Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.",
			"A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.",
			"Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).",
			"<b>How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nutrien?</b>",
			"For Nutrien, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.03%.",
			"On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.",
			"So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nutrien will beat the consensus EPS estimate.",
			"<b>Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?</b>",
			"Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.",
			"For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Nutrien would post earnings of $2.63 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.02, delivering a surprise of -23.19%.",
			"Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.",
			"<b>Bottom Line</b>",
			"An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.",
			"That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.",
			"Nutrien doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.",
			"Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.",

			"TORONTO (Reuters) -Barrick Gold Corp is not interested in bidding for the copper assets of Teck Resources Ltd as there are few synergies between the companies, CEO Mark Bristow said in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday.",
			"Bristow's comments come at a time when Canadian mining company Teck has rebuffed a $22.5 billion unsolicited bid from Swiss mining company Glencore Plc and said it is exploring its own simplified diversification that includes opening its metals and coal business to a competitive bidding process.",
			"\"We don't think we bring any synergies to that party,\" Bristow told Reuters, adding that even if Teck does a clean split of its copper and coal business, its debt is a problem.",
			"\"We would just have to take over the debt and we still get the assets that don't bring synergies.\"",
			"Barrick has been building its copper business organically and said it is exploring copper drilling opportunities in countries such as Chile and Argentina. In the first quarter of 2023 it produced 88 million pounds of copper, down from 101 million pounds a year ago.",
			"\"We have always said that if you want to be relevant as a gold miner you have to be in copper business,\" Bristow added.",
			"Gold is often a byproduct of copper, a critical metal required for electrification and the transition to a greener economy. That has pushed many global miners to hunt for more production assets. Canada's Lundin Mining Corp in March bought a 51% stake in a copper mine in Chile for $950 million.",
			"With limited copper mines available, large mining companies have been looking at separating their base metals and coal businesses to unlock potentially high value from the former.",
			"Earlier on Wednesday, Barrick beat Wall Street expectations for first-quarter profit, as higher gold prices outweighed a decline in production. Barrick shares were up 1.2% by late morning, in a flat broader market.",
			"Teck last month withdrew its plan to split its coal and metals business after it failed to secure shareholders' approval. The company's board rejected the offer from Glencore and said it would come up with a new simplified plan of separation.",
			"Bristow said Glencore's proposal made a \"lot of sense\" as Glencore could handle Teck's debt and had offered a clean split of Teck's business.",
			"Glencore has offered to sweeten its offer to Teck and has said it will take its offer directly to shareholders if Teck's board does not engage.",

			"Dividend investing is an investment strategy that focuses on investing in companies that pay dividends to their shareholders. Dividends are a portion of a company's profits that are distributed to its shareholders in the form of cash payments or additional shares of stock. One of the main goals for dividend investing is to generate stable income for shareholders and to benefit from potential long-term capital appreciation of the stock.",
			"When investing in dividend stocks, investors often pay attention to companies that have raised their payouts over the long haul. Moreover, these companies perform better during periods of economic downturns because of their stable cash flows and solid balance sheets. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:CVX;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/chevron%20corp/93410/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVX</a>), Medtronic plc (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:MDT;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/medtronic%20plc/1613103/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MDT</a>), NextEra Energy, Inc.

			"Though dividend investing can be a conservative approach, it can help investors create long-term wealth if done properly. For this reason, we have compiled a list of 25 things every dividend investor should know.",

			"Dividends have significantly contributed to market returns over the years. According to a report by <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Hartford Funds;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.hartfordfunds.com/dam/en/docs/pub/whitepapers/WP106.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hartford Funds</a>, dividend income has accounted for 41% of the S&amp;P 500's total return on average from 1930 to 2022. The report also highlighted that from 2000 to 2009, the S&amp;P 500 delivered a negative return to shareholders mainly due to the dot-com bubble burst in March 2000. However, dividends provided a 1.8% annualized return during this decade.",
			"Dividend stocks have delivered a solid performance in the past, outperforming their non-dividend counterparts in terms of total returns. <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Hartford Funds;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.hartfordfunds.com/dam/en/docs/pub/whitepapers/WP106.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hartford Funds</a> reported that dividend payers delivered an average annual return of 9.18% from 1973 to 2022, compared with a negative 0.60% return of the non-dividend payers. During the same period, the S&amp;P 500 index returned 7.68%.",
			"Last year's continuous interest rate hikes and growing inflation caused the stock market to report its worst year since the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. The S&amp;P 500 declined by over 18% in 2022, compared with a less harsh drop of 7.6% in the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Payers. During the year, the S&amp;P 500 Non-Dividend Payers fell by 21.1%, significantly underperforming dividend stocks.",
			"Another report by <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Fidelity Investments;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/inflation-and-dividend-stocks\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fidelity Investments</a> revealed that the performance of dividend cutters and eliminators was not up to par historically. These securities underperformed the market by 20% to 25% during the year leading up to the cut.",
			"Dividend stocks are defensive in nature and can provide a hedge against inflation. Dividend payments from companies tend to increase over time and can potentially keep pace with rising prices. According to a report by <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Fidelity Investments;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/inflation-and-dividend-stocks\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fidelity Investments</a>, dividends represented over 54% of the market's returns during decades when inflation was high. The report further mentioned that during the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, dividends represented 67%, 44%, and 73% of the market's returns, respectively. During these decades, inflation averaged above 5% and total returns were lower than 10%.",
			"Not only did dividend stocks deliver solid returns during high inflationary periods, but the dividend growth of the companies also outpaced inflation over the years. From 1971 to 2021, dividends paid by companies in the US have grown by 3.7% per year, compared with a 2% growth in inflation per year, as reported by <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:BlackRock;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/ca/investors/en/market-insights/dividend-growth-and-inflation\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BlackRock</a>. Another report by <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Wisdom Tree;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.wisdomtree.com/-/media/us-media-files/documents/resource-library/presentations/dividend_monitor_presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wisdom Tree</a> also highlighted the strong performance of dividends relative to inflation. The report mentioned that the S&amp;P 500 dividends have grown by 5.73% from 1957 to 2022, compared with a 3.68% growth in inflation during the same period.",
			"This suggests that dividend payments have grown at a faster pace than inflation, which can help to maintain the purchasing power of the income generated by dividend-paying stocks. <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:The Vanguard Group;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.vanguard.co.uk/professional/insights-education/insights/dividends-and-the-long-term-benefits-of-diversification\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Vanguard Group</a>, an American investment management company, also reported that the US dividend growth has surpassed inflation by five percentage points over the 20 years ending October 30, 2022, and by 2.1 percentage points over 100 years.",
			"Dividend stocks are comparatively less volatile than other equity investments. When investors receive a dividend payment from a company, it provides a positive return on their investment, regardless of whether the stock price is rising or falling. This can help to reduce the overall volatility of the investment, as the dividend payment can offset any decline in the stock price. According to a report by <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Wisdom Tree;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.wisdomtree.com/-/media/us-media-files/documents/resource-library/presentations/dividend_monitor_presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wisdom Tree</a>, in the last 64 years, dividend levels declined in only six of those years, whereas stock prices fell in 18 of those years in comparison. The report mentioned that stock prices were over two times more volatile than their underlying dividend cash flows.",
			"The dividend payout ratio is the percentage of a company's earnings that are paid out in dividends. A high payout ratio may indicate that a company is paying out more than it can afford, while a low payout ratio may indicate that a company is retaining more earnings for future growth. According to analysts, the dividend payout ratio of between 35% to 55% is considered healthy as it shows that the company has enough money left over to reinvest for growth.",
			"<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Hartford Funds;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.hartfordfunds.com/dam/en/docs/pub/whitepapers/WP106.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hartford Funds</a> analyzed the dividend payout ratio of dividend stocks within the Russell 1000 by dividing them into five quintiles. The study found that companies paying the highest level of dividends have not performed well as those with moderate payouts and yields. This group of dividends had an average payout ratio of 40% from 1979 to 2022 and also beat the market by 78% during the same period.",
			"High-yield dividend stocks can be more volatile as these stocks may be more sensitive to changes in interest rates and market conditions, which can impact the value of the stock. According to a report by <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:AllianceBernstein;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.alliancebernstein.com/corporate/en/insights/investment-insights/equity-income-the-dividend-defense-against-inflation.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AllianceBernstein</a>, the MSCI USA High Dividend Yield Index Index, and the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index underperformed the broader market in over seven of the last ten years through 2021.",
			"According to analysts, dividend yields between 3% to 6% are considered healthy as they can provide a reasonable level of income for investors. However, it is not the same with all high-yield dividend stocks. For instance, in some industries, such as utilities and real estate investment trusts (REITs), higher dividend yields may be more common and considered healthy due to the nature of the business model and the need to generate consistent income for shareholders. Investors should always look for the respective company's business model and dividend sustainability to make investment decisions. For example, companies like Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:MO;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/altria%20group%20inc/764180/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MO</a>), Verizon Communications Inc.

(NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:TDS;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/telephone%20%26%20data%20systems%20inc/1051512/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TDS</a>), and British American Tobacco p.l.c. (NYSE:<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:BTI;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/british%20american%20tobacco%20plc/1068892/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BTI</a>) have above-average dividend yields but also possess strong dividend histories and solid balance sheets.",
			"The S&amp;P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats tracks the performance of companies with over 20 years of consecutive dividend growth and had an average yield of 3.5% from December 31, 1999, to December 31, 2018. The index generated a total return of 590.3% from December 1999 to June 2019, with dividends accounting for 57% of the total returns, according to a report by <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:S&amp;P Global;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/education/education-sp-high-yield-dividend-aristocrats-a-practitioners-guide.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P Global</a>. During the same period, the S&amp;P Composite 1500 delivered a total return of 215.2%.",
			"<a class=\"link yahoo-link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Dividend Aristocrats;elm:context_link;itc:0;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;\" href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/14-best-dividend-aristocrat-stocks-154145869.html\">Dividend Aristocrats</a> are the companies in the S&amp;P 500 that have increased their dividend payouts to shareholders for at least 25 consecutive years. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), and The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) are some popular dividend aristocrats. These companies become top choices for investors because of their financial strength, stability, and commitment to returning value to shareholders. Moreover, these companies tend to perform better during periods of high inflation. This group of dividends outperformed other asset classes when inflation closed out with a 6.5% annual reading in 2022. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats reported a 6.21% drop last year, compared with an 18.1% decline in the broader market.",
			"Historical analysis of such stocks also shows their strong performance over other asset classes. According to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Merrill Edge;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.merrilledge.com/article/in-volatile-markets-investors-may-find-comfort-in-dividends\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Merrill Edge</a>, an American financial services company, the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats delivered an annual average return of 12.13% from 1990 through 2018, compared with a 9.96% return from the broader market during the same period.",
			"Yes, the dividend growth rate is a crucial factor in dividend investing, as it reflects a company's ability to increase its dividend payouts to shareholders over time. Companies that are able to consistently grow their dividend payments at a healthy rate are often considered to be strong and stable investments, as this indicates that they have a strong and growing cash flow and are committed to returning value to their shareholders. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), and The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) are favored by investors due to long dividend growth streaks.",
			"Over the years, companies that have raised their dividends have delivered strong returns to shareholders in comparison with non-dividend payers and dividend cutters. According to a report by <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Washington Crossing Advisors;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://washingtoncrossingadvisors.com/commentary/042215/042215.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Washington Crossing Advisors</a>, dividend growers and initiators delivered an annual average return of 11.6%from 1972 to 2014, compared with a 3.4% return of the dividend cutters during the same period. <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:RMB Capital;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://rmbcapital.com/news-and-insights/importance-dividend-growth\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">RMB Capital</a> referred to data by Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds and revealed that dividend growers returned 9.62% from 1972 to December 31, 2018, versus a negative 0.79% return of the dividend cutters. During this period, the S&amp;P 500 delivered an annual average return of 7.30%, underperforming dividend growers.",
			"Analysts always recommend investing in companies with strong dividend growth tracks as compared with high-yield dividend stocks. <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Nuveen;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://documents.nuveen.com/Documents/Nuveen/Default.aspx?uniqueid=7216b2f7-2937-4c18-9369-2c27691868c4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nuveen</a> reported that dividend growers with modest yields delivered a 26.8% return on equity in 2022, compared with a 20.4% return on stocks with yields above 3%.

			"Strong cash flow is an important factor in dividend investing, as it enables companies to fund their dividend payments and continue to increase them over time. Dividend growers often have strong and growing cash flows. This is because companies that are able to increase their dividends are typically generating higher profits and cash flows, which allows them to return value to their shareholders through increased dividend payments. Some examples of dividend growers are Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), and The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW).",
			"Analysts have given a positive outlook on dividend growth as cash on corporate balance sheets remains stable. According to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Moody's Investor Services;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/05/how-markets-biggest-companies-manage-cash-and-investments.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Moody's Investor Services</a>, US companies have at least $2 trillion in cash, with technology companies taking up a quarter of it. Companies that grow their dividends typically review their cash flows before paying dividends to ensure they have the financial resources to meet their obligations to shareholders, <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:according;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-spend-record-amounts-on-dividends-despite-looming-downturn-11672343632\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according</a> to Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.",

The goal of this strategy is to capture the dividend payment while minimizing exposure to the stock's price movements. The ex-dividend date is the day on which a stock begins trading without the dividend payment included in its price. Investors who own the stock on or before the ex-dividend date are entitled to receive the dividend payment.",
			"Dividend-paying stocks can be found across a variety of sectors, including but not limited to utilities, consumer staples, healthcare, financials, and technology. Companies from different sectors may have varying dividend policies, payout ratios, and growth rates, depending on their industry dynamics and business models. For example, utility companies are often viewed as stable dividend-paying stocks due to their predictable cash flows and regulated business models.",
			"Similarly, energy companies also pay strong dividends to shareholders and have grown their dividends steadily in recent years. <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Morningstar;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1147626/4-energy-stocks-with-fast-growing-dividends\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Morningstar</a> reported that dividends in the energy sector have grown by  401% since 2018, compared with an 86% dividend growth in the rest of the US market.

Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) are some of the best dividend stocks from the energy sector.",
			"Dividend ETFs typically invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks across various sectors and industries, providing investors with exposure to a broad range of companies and reducing the risk of concentrated exposure to a single stock or sector. Considering the current inflationary environment and consistent interest rate hikes, investors are also considering dividend ETFs.

			"Dividends are not completely immune to market downturns, as companies may experience declines in earnings and cash flows during economic recessions or periods of market volatility. In such environments, companies may face pressure to cut or suspend their dividends to preserve cash and maintain financial stability. The most recent example of such a phenomenon was seen during the recent pandemic of 2020. During the year, nearly 190 US-listed companies stopped paying dividends and 33% of them hadn't restored their dividends, as of December 31, 2022. Moreover, dividend cuts and suspensions amounted to over $220 billion between the second and fourth quarters of 2020,<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:CNBC;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/22/220-billion-of-global-dividends-cuts-in-2020-janus-henderson-says.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> CNBC</a> posted.",

			"Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG) came out with quarterly earnings of $3.78 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.20 per share. This compares to earnings of $5.03 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.",
			"This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 18.13%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this lawn and garden products company would post a loss of $1.40 per share when it actually produced a loss of $1.02, delivering a surprise of 27.14%.",
			"Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.",
			"Scotts , which belongs to the Zacks Fertilizers industry, posted revenues of $1.53 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.32%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.68 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.",
			"The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.",
			"Scotts shares have added about 42.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.3%.",
			"<b>What's Next for Scotts?</b>",
			"While Scotts has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?",
			"There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.",
			"Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.",
			"Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Scotts: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.",
			"It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.87 on $1.19 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.11 on $3.81 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.",
			"Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Fertilizers is currently in the bottom 7% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.",

			"This producer of potash and other fertilizers is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.54 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -43%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.",

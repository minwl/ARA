			"Data Center companies worldwide posted record revenues in 2022, which reached $321.47 billion, according to a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Statista;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/tmo/data-center/worldwide#revenue\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Statista</a> analysis. The analysis anticipates the market to add more than $20 billion to the valuation by the end of this year. The 2022 performance is impressive, considering the global data center revenue was sub-$200 billion just two years ago.",
			"According to a research by Allied Market Research, the data center market was worth $187.35 billion in 2020 and was expected to clock $517.17 billion by 2030. Interestingly, Statista's analysis reaches a valuation close to Allied Market Research's, positing that the global data centers market will generate approximately $410.40 billion in revenue by 2027. However, the former's CAGR is significantly smaller, at 4.66%, compared to Allied Market Research's 10.50%. The CAGR mismatch notwithstanding, there appears to be strong agreement that the data centers market has immense potential to break past the half trillion USD mark before the decade's end.",
			"The CAGRs that several analyses are quoting at which the data center services market will grow in a particular forecast period are incredible. For example, Allied Market Research quotes 10.50% between 2021 and 2030, while <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Mordor Intelligence's;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/service-market-for-data-center\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mordor Intelligence's</a> figure is 13.69% between 2021 and 2026. In this light, a question arises: How will the market achieve an astronomical growth rate? In other words, what factors will drive the growth incredible growth?",
			"For Mordor Intelligence, the growing demand for cloud services will carry much weight. The claim is perhaps in response to a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Markets and Markets;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/cloud-computing-market-234.html#:~:text=The%20global%20cloud%20computing%20market,17.9%25%20from%202022%20to%202027.\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Markets and Markets</a> report, which established that the cloud computing market will expand at a 17% CAGR between 2022 and 2027, reaching $1,240.90 billion. Since data centers provide the critical infrastructure that keeps the cloud computing market running, any expansion that cloud computing posts naturally reaches data center services companies.",
			"Besides cloud computing, increasing demand for e-commerce services will also spur growth in the data center services market. According to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Statista;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/ecommerce/worldwide#:~:text=Revenue%20in%20the%20eCommerce%20market,US%246.35tn%20by%202027.\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Statista</a>, the revenue generated by e-commerce companies worldwide could reach $4.11 trillion at the end of this year. The organization makes a bolder claim that the market should be worth $6.35 trillion by 2027, thanks to an 11.51% CAGR. With the expansion of the e-commerce space comes the possibility of the data center services market's growth potential blowing up. This is because e-commerce customers want more personalized data and better recommendations for what products to buy, which is made possible by services undergirded by data centers.",
			"As the growth potential of the data center services market expands, the companies involved in this space have more room to grow revenues. Consequently, with stronger financials comes an increased likelihood for the stocks to climb higher.

			"As 2023 unfolds, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are facing a challenging landscape, underperforming when compared to the overall stock market. The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund, which is considered to be the benchmark ETF for the REIT sector, has dipped by 11.16% from its year-to-date (YTD) high, while the S&amp;P 500 is sitting only about 1.2% below its high for the year. This downturn is particularly concerning for major REITs, as they grapple with the implications of this trend on their long-term growth and stability.",
			"Realty Income Corp (NYSE: <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:O;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=O\">O</a>) is currently trading at almost 8% below its 2023 high, while WP Carey Inc (NYSE: <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:WPC;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=WPC\">WPC</a>) has fallen more than 14% from its high of $85.55 in January.",
			"Two of the primary factors contributing to the recent underperformance of REITs are the rising interest rates and the recent bank failures. However, the fundamentals of many of these REITs remain strong. Their performance is tied more to stock market fears than the actual performance of the real estate market.",
			"<strong>Don't miss:</strong>",
			"In stark contrast, private market real estate investors continue to see positive returns. For example, <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Trion Properties';elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/alternative-investments/platform/trion-properties?utm_campaign=partner_feed&amp;utm_source=yahooFinance&amp;utm_medium=partner_feed&amp;utm_content=site\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Trion Properties'</strong></a> latest offering is expected to provide investors with a 17.47% Internal Rate of Return (IRR) over the four-year hold period. This investment firm has produced an impressive average IRR of 25% for accredited investors through its real estate offerings.",
			"When asked how Trion Properties manages to provide market-beating returns, Managing Partner <strong>Max Sharkansky</strong> attributes their success to smart buying practices. \"I think that we buy well. You make the money on the buy, so that's half the battle. We pick up a lot of properties off-market, so we're starting with a lower basis. We're also buying in great markets,\" says Sharkansky.",
			"Sharkansky also highlights the company's focus on markets with significant growth potential, such as South Florida. \"Florida's growth story is unbelievable,\" he explains.",
			"Another crucial factor in Trion Properties' success is its value-add strategy. This approach involves acquiring properties that need improvements, making necessary renovations and increasing the property's value by raising rents or reducing expenses. This creates a higher return on investment for investors.",
			"Considering the current underperformance of REITs and the promising returns from private market real estate investments, some investors might find <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:private market opportunities;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/alternative-investments?utm_campaign=partner_feed&amp;utm_source=yahooFinance&amp;utm_medium=partner_feed&amp;utm_content=site\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">private market opportunities</a> more appealing.",
			"For one, private market investments often provide better insulation from stock market fluctuations, as their performance is driven by the real estate market rather than broader market fears. This allows investors to benefit from the strong fundamentals of real estate without being subject to the whims of the stock market.",
			"Moreover, private real estate investments often boast more attractive returns when compared to publicly traded REITs. The ability to invest in off-market properties, focus on high-growth markets and implement value-add strategies in multifamily real estate enables private market investments to generate higher IRRs.",
			"Investors seeking to diversify their portfolios and potentially achieve better returns in the current economic climate may find private market real estate investments a more attractive option than publicly traded REITs.",

			"<strong>Prologis Inc.</strong> PLD is well-positioned to bank on the favorable industrial real estate market environment, backed by its solid operating platform and robust scale. The company, which has emerged as a market leader in this asset category, is witnessing solid demand for its industrial real estate, as reflected by the leasing, rent and occupancy levels of the properties.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, with the e-commerce boom, growth in industries and companies making efforts to improve supply-chain efficiencies, the demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks has risen. This is aiding the industrial real estate market to prosper and benefit Prologis, <strong>STAG Industrial, Inc.</strong> STAG and <strong>First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc.</strong> FR.<br/><br/>Resilience is essential to the future of the supply chains. Therefore, over the long term, apart from the fast adoption of e-commerce, logistics real estate is expected to benefit from an increase in inventory levels, offering possibilities to industrial landlords, including Prologis, STAG Industrial and First Industrial Realty, to enjoy a favorable market environment.<br/><br/>Prologis, in particular, has been witnessing a decent operating performance. The average occupancy level in Prologis’ owned and managed portfolio was 98% in the first quarter of 2023. Further, 49.7 million square feet (msf) of leases commenced in the company’s owned and managed portfolio, with 41.6 msf in the operating portfolio and 8.1 msf in the development portfolio. The retention level was 77.2% in the quarter.<br/><br/>Prologis’ share of net effective rent change was 68.8% in the January-March quarter, which marked an all-time high and was led by the United States at 78.8%. The cash rent change was 41.9%, representing an all-time high.<br/><br/>Cash same-store net operating income (NOI) grew 11.4% in the first quarter and denoted an all-time high. For 2023, management expects cash same-store NOI (Prologis share) of 9-9.75%.<br/><br/>With healthy operating fundamentals in the industrial real estate markets, Prologis has capitalized on growth opportunities through acquisitions and developments. Prologis’ investments over the years comprise a wide array, including the largest M&amp;A transactions in the real estate sector and individual off-market deals below $5 million. For 2023, the company anticipates acquisitions at Prologis share between $300 million and $600 million, whereas development starts are expected to be $2.5-$3 billion.<br/><br/>Prologis is focused on bolstering its liquidity. The company boasts a liquidity position of $6.7 billion, inclusive of $1.0 billion of additional line of credit capacity closed in April. Given its balance sheet strength and prudent financial management, PLD is well-poised to capitalize on growth opportunities.<br/><br/>Moreover, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders and Prologis is committed to that. In the last five years, Prologis has increased its dividend five times and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 12.87%. <strong>Check Prologis’ dividend history here</strong>.<br/><br/>However, with the asset category being attractive in these challenging times, there is a development boom in a number of markets. The high supply is likely to fuel competition and curb pricing power. New supply is likely to create pressure on vacancy levels and rent growth to some extent in the upcoming quarters.<br/><br/>The stabilization of e-commerce sales growth raises concerns for Prologis. Moreover, a hike in the interest rate is concerning for PLD. Rising rates imply higher borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. Further, the dividend payout may become less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money market accounts.<br/><br/>Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 17.0% in the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 1.3%.

			"<strong>Operator:</strong> Good day, and welcome to the Realty Income First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. . Please also note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrea Behr, Associate Director of Corporate Communications. Please go ahead.",
			"<strong>Andrea Behr:</strong> Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's First Quarter Operating Results Conference Call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Jonathan Pong, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Finance. During this conference call, we will make statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&amp;A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.",
			"<strong>Sumit Roy :</strong> Thank you, Andrea. Welcome, everyone. We are pleased to report solid 2023 first quarter results, exhibiting continued momentum in our business. I would like to express my utmost gratitude to our One Team whose efforts enabled us to continue delivering on our growth objectives. I would also like to thank our equity and fixed income investors for their continued vote of confidence. Our team's efforts and the benefits of our size and scale were reflected in our first quarter results, highlighted by approximately $1.7 billion of high-quality investments acquired at a cash cap rate of 7%. This represents a 90 basis point increase compared to the investment cash cap rate we achieved in the fourth quarter of last year and resulted in an investment spread of 163 basis points, which is above our historical averages.",
			"As we have experienced in prior cycles, cap rates for our investments after an adjustment period have historically tended to be positively correlated with interest rates, which is a trend we have largely continued to experience this year after the recent rise in rates. Our ability to access well-priced capital has historically served as a competitive advantage and is a testament to our long history of maintaining a conservative balance sheet and a diversified real estate portfolio, supported by clients who are leaders in their respective industries. Amidst an environment in which capital is expensive and are scarce for many of our clients, our value proposition is even more pronounced. This dynamic is reflected in the recent portfolio acquisitions we have announced, the active deal pipeline we see today and the favorable pricing spread we see for large portfolio transactions vis-a-vis one-off single asset transactions.",
			"Our differentiated platform extends beyond the external growth lens. Recently, we have taken steps to leverage the size of our portfolio and the history of our operating business through the continued development of advanced analytics. The objective of this initiative is to develop predictive and prescriptive insights that harness the collective proprietary data that we've accumulated over several decades of investing in managing and releasing single-tenant net lease properties. Our team's proprietary predictive analytic tool leverages the strove of information in our investment underwriting, portfolio management, asset management and development efforts enabling even more informed investment decisions made by our best-in-class One Team members.",
			"As our business grows, so too will the predictive power of this tool, which we believe will generate significant value for our stakeholders as we refine the accuracy, test conclusions and broaden scope across industries, property types and geographies. As part of our core investment thesis, our size and scale have created opportunities to serve as a capital provider for best-in-class partners looking for alternative means of financing given elevated debt costs. In the first quarter, we agreed to acquire up to 415 high-quality convenience stores from EG Group for $1.5 billion. Over 80% of the total portfolio annualized contractual rent is expected to be generated from properties under the Cumberland Farms brand, and we expect to close on this transaction in the second quarter.",
			"As illustrated by this deal, we believe our ability to offer not only certainty of close, but also attractively priced capital as a one-stop solution for sale-leaseback transactions is particularly valuable to institutional sellers of real estate today. We believe this will continue to expand our competitive advantage. Internationally, we continue to venture into new geographical verticals and grow the total addressable market opportunity. This quarter, we took advantage of favorable pricing internationally to acquire properties worth approximately $390 million at an initial cash lease yield of 7.6%. After our initial entry into international markets in 2019, we now derive 11.7% of total portfolio annualized contractual rent from those markets.",
			"This natural extension of our platform has been a pillar of growth for the last four years and is indicative of our ability to methodically establish and scale a new vertical. Given the continued momentum in our acquisitions pipeline and our progress to date, we are increasing our 2023 investment guidance to over $6 billion from our prior guidance of over $5 billion. Consistent with our investment strategy, we remain disciplined with regard to our balance sheet. Subsequent to our April bond offering, which settled on April 14 and we held approximately $5.6 billion of liquidity, including unsettled forward equity totaling $1.5 billion. As a result, our current financial position has afforded us the ability to lean into near-term investment opportunities.",
			"Moving to operations. Our platform continues to generate durable cash flows, which support our stable earnings profile. For the first quarter, we are pleased to report occupancy of 99%, matching last quarter for the highest rate at the end of a reporting period in over 20 years. Additionally, we generated a 101.7% recapture rate across 176 renewed or new leases executed during the quarter. These results are a reflection of our talented asset management team and our unwavering commitment to core capital allocation principles, which include a focus on industry-leading clients who often operate in a low price point service-based or nondiscretionary industries. Our purposeful diversification across industries, geographies and clients and our emphasis on high-quality real estate locations and rigorous credit underwriting.",
			"Our investment philosophy is nuanced and not simply predicated upon the pursuit of investment-grade clients, which ended the first quarter at 40.8% of our annualized contractual rent. Many of our strongest operators, such as Sainsbury's have no public debt and thus are not rated at all. However, the consistency of their operations and health of their balance sheet are favorable attributes that are consistent with those of an investment-grade rated company. We estimate that approximately 5.3% of our annualized contractual rent comes from unrated operators without public debt. We remain committed to investments that offer us attractive risk-adjusted returns as evidenced throughout our history. And going forward, where we believe, based upon our disciplined underwriting and analytics, we are achieving better returns per unit of incremental risk.",
			"I would like to briefly touch on Cineworld which represents 1.3% of our annualized contractual rent. Despite the ongoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy, we have continued to receive 100% of contractual rent in the first quarter and through April. As of March 31, 2023, we had cumulative reserves of $33 million on our Cineworld properties. Outstanding receivables net of reserves and excluding straight-line receivables were $14.1 million. We remain in discussions with this client and we'll update the market on the outcome of these discussions at the appropriate time. Before turning the call over to Christie, I would like to highlight that in March, we published our third annual sustainability report which details our ongoing commitment to operating as a responsible corporate citizen for our stockholders, our team, the communities in which we operate and the environment.",
			"I'm proud of our continued progress on ESG initiatives as we seek to fulfill our commitment to building sustainable relationships and I strongly encourage all of today's listeners to navigate to the Sustainability page of our website to review the report. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Christie.",
			"TaLaNoVa/Shutterstock.com",
			"<strong>Christie Kelly:</strong> Thank you, Sumit. We work together with our clients and our One Team to achieve a successful quarter on a number of fronts, delivering AFFO per share of $0.98 on behalf of all of our stakeholders. We would highlight that the comparable quarter in 2022 benefited from approximately $10.2 million of rental revenue reserve reversals, resulting in an AFFO per share growth headwind of approximately $0.015 per share in the first quarter of 2023. In addition, higher year-over-year short-term interest rates represented an approximate $0.02 growth headwind as our weighted average interest rate on revolver and commercial paper borrowings was approximately 300 basis points higher than it was in the comparative period in 2022 on a similar average borrowing base.",
			"Excluding these two items, our year-over-year AFFO per share growth rate was approximately 3.5% this quarter. As we evaluate the core fundamentals of our business, we remain focused upon delivering for our stakeholders over the long term and are encouraged by opportunities ahead. To that end, we are increasing the low end of our AFFO per share guidance range by $0.01 resulting in a new range of $3.94 to $4.03, which represents 1.7% annual growth at the midpoint of the updated range. It has been a busy and productive start to the year on the capital raising front. Despite continued market volatility, we have raised approximately $3.9 billion of capital this year excluding $1.5 billion of unsettled forward equity. In April, we closed a $1 billion bond offering, which was comprised of $400 million of 4.7% senior unsecured notes due in 2028 and $600 million of 4.9% senior unsecured notes due in 2033, resulted in a weighted average tenure of eight years and semi-annual yield to maturity of 5.05%.",
			"The issuance allowed us to satisfy our near-term debt issuance needs while reducing our exposure to variable rate revolver and commercial paper borrowings and to almost zero after our transaction closed on April 14. In March, we increased our dividend for the 120th time since our public listing in 1994, to an annual rate of $3.06 per share, representing 3.2% growth from the prior year period. Providing a stable and growing dividend is core to our mission at Realty Income, and we take great pride in being one of only 66 constituents in the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index for having raised our dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years. I would like to thank our One Team whose focus and diligence has paved the way for our continued growth as we build upon our track record of consistency.",

			"<strong>Operator:</strong> Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Public Storage First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ryan, you may begin.",
			"<strong>Ryan Burke:</strong> Thank you, Britney. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2023 earnings call. I’m here with Joe Russell and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain economic risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, May 4, 2023, and we assume no obligation to update, revise or supplement statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures we provide on this call is included in our earnings release.",
			"You can find our press release, supplemental report, SEC reports and an audio replay of this conference call on our website at publicstorage.com. We do ask that you initially keep your questions limited to two. Of course, if you have additional questions, feel free to jump back in queue. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Joe.",
			"<strong>Joseph Russell:</strong> Thank you, Ryan, and thank you for joining us today. Public Storage had a very good start to 2023. We remain focused on leading the self-storage industry’s digital evolution, transforming our own operating model, and enhancing and growing the portfolio. In the quarter, we achieved new milestones on several of our key initiatives, which included exceeding 60% of customers choosing to move in through our eRental online lease, eclipsing two million downloads of the Public Storage mobile app, reaching 400 properties on our customer demand-driven digital operating platform, installing solar at more than 200 properties putting us on track to complete at least 1,000 property installations within the next three years, completion of over 70% of the property of Tomorrow Enhancement Program, growing NOI by 29% across the 529 acquisition and development properties in our non-same-store pool, and driving the industry’s largest development pipeline to an excess of $1 billion to be delivered over the next 24 months.",
			"We had a strong operating performance in the first quarter, particularly with existing customers performing well and same-store move-in volume up nearly 13%. Length of stays are strong and same-store revenues were up nearly 10% year-over-year. Our exceptionally large non-same store acquisition and development pool now nearly 25% of the overall portfolio continues to outperform as well. Fundamentally, self-storage is a needs-based business with demand drivers that are multidimensional and fluid throughout economic cycles. We also continue to benefit from people spending more time at home, which has increasing permanence with remote and hybrid work here to stay. Additionally, with the return to more seasonal patterns of demand, we are currently also seeing an uptick in movement activity that has continued into the second quarter.",
			"We also continue to find good opportunity in development and redevelopment as well, with a vibrant pipeline poised to generate growth for years to come. Our unique ability to weather economic cycles serves us well, particularly while other developers have slowed their activity due to higher interest rates, cost pressures, difficult municipal processes and concern over the near macro term landscape. Now I’ll turn the call over to Tom to discuss acquisition market and financial performance.",

			"<strong>Tom Boyle:</strong> Thanks, Joe. The transaction market has been relatively quiet to start the year as potential sellers feel out the macro environment, higher interest rates and the spread between buyer and seller expectations. That said, we have closed or are under contract to acquire nearly $200 million right on track for our $750 million outlook for the year. The vast majority of our acquisitions this year have been done off-market quietly. More recently, we’ve been encouraged by an increase in inbounds, which are primarily small to medium-sized portfolios. We’re in a great position to acquire today given our cost and access to capital advantages paired with our industry-leading NOI margins. Now on to financial performance. As Joe mentioned, we started the year strong reporting core FFO of $4.08 for the quarter, representing 16.2% growth over the first quarter of 2022, excluding the contribution from PSB.",
			"Looking at the components. In the same-store, our revenue increased 9.8% compared to the first quarter of 2022. We drove strong move-in volumes up 13% during the quarter heading into our peak leasing season and the existing tenant base remained strong with length of stays sitting at records. Same-store cost of operations were up 5.6%, leading to total net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties growing 11.2% for the quarter. In addition to the same-store, the lease-up in performance of the recently acquired and developed facilities remained a standout in the quarter growing 29% compared to last year. Shifting to the outlook. We lifted our outlook for the year, driven by increasing our same-store revenue assumptions.",
			"While the macro environment remains uncertain, performance to date has been encouraging. We’re set up well heading into the second quarter. Last but not least, our capital and liquidity position remains rock solid. Our net leverage of 3.3x, combined with $700 million of cash on hand at quarter-end, puts us in a very strong position for capital allocation as we move through the year. Now I’ll turn it back to Joe.",
			"<strong>Joseph Russell:</strong> Thanks, Tom. Our people, technologies, platforms, balance sheet and brand have and will be continually enhanced to create and strengthen the competitive advantages we have across the entire Public Storage enterprise. We see opportunity in the current environment and are poised to execute with focus on delivering growth and value for our shareholders. Let’s go ahead and open the call up for questions.",

That’s despite the fact that Yieldstreet would like to grow its single-family home portfolio from its value right now of around $200 million value to $1.5 billion over the next five years. If the company goes through with it, that would mark a 650% increase in its single-family holdings by 2028.",
			"But it isn't just about home prices: Interest rates on “floating” loans offered to firms like Yieldstreet are still in the 7% to 8% range, Joshi says. Those high interest rates, coupled with frothy home prices, mean that buying new single-family rentals doesn’t make a lot of sense right now for some institutional investors.",
			"Joshi says Yieldstreet is waiting for either house prices to take another leg down or interest rates to come back down. Or both.",
			"“If short-term [interest] rates came down around 4%, and if home prices were about 15% lower than the peak last year, that is a valuation that supports the equity return that investors need to make,” Joshi tells <em>Fortune</em>.",

			"<strong>Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated</strong> JLL — popularly known as JLL — reported first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 65 cents, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.69. The reported figure plunged 81.3% from the prior-year quarter’s $3.47. Shares of JLL were marginally down during May 4 regular trading session on the NYSE following the announcement.<br/><br/>JLL’s transaction-based businesses, specifically the Capital Markets and Leasing under Markets Advisory, performed poorly as higher interest rates and macroeconomic uncertainty resulted in lower transaction volumes. However, the company’s Work Dynamics and Technologies segments did well in the reported quarter.<br/><br/>Revenues totaled $4.72 billion, falling 1.8% from the year-ago quarter’s $4.80 billion. Nonetheless, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.53 billion.<br/><br/>The quarterly adjusted EBITDA margin dipped to 6.9% (USD) from 14.4% in the prior-year period due to a decrease in transaction-based revenues, specifically Leasing, Investment Sales and Debt/Equity Advisory and the change in equity earnings.<br/><br/>Per Christian Ulbrich, CEO of JLL, “Our first quarter financial results were in line with the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. Strong fee revenue growth in our resilient business lines was offset by the continuation of the industry-wide slowdown in investment sales and leasing volumes.”",
			"During the first quarter, the Markets Advisory segment’s revenues and fee revenues came in at $906.4 million and $627.3 million, respectively, reflecting a fall of 9.3% and 15.4% (in USD) year over year. Lower transaction volume across asset types and a decrease in average deal size, mainly in the office sector, led to a fall in Leasing fee revenues, which was the prime reason for the decline in Markets Advisory revenues and fee revenues.<br/><br/>Revenues and fee revenues for the Capital Markets segment were $357.1 million and $349.6 million, respectively, decreasing 40.5% and 41% (in USD) year over year. The fall was due to lower Investment Sales and Debt/Equity Advisory fees as rising interest rates and macroeconomic uncertainty hurt market transaction volumes and elongated the deal-cycle time.<br/><br/>JLL’s Work Dynamics segment reported revenues and fee revenues of $3.28 billion and $442 million, respectively, up 8% and 7.8% (in USD) year over year. The rise in revenues and fee growth was attributable to the continued resiliency within Workplace Management services. Also, the continued momentum in project demand in several geographies, predominantly in the United States, France and MENA, drove the Project Management services’ growth.<br/><br/>JLL Technologies segment reported revenues and fee revenues of $61.4 million and $57.8 million, respectively, rising 24.3% and 27.6% (in USD) from the prior-year quarter levels. The growth was backed by an increase in existing customers, led by solutions and service offerings, especially large enterprise clients.<br/><br/>The revenues and fee revenues in the LaSalle segment fell 3.3% and 4.2% (in USD) year over year to $114.4 million and $107.3 million, respectively. The rise in advisory fees was concentrated in core open-end funds, mainly in North America and Asia Pacific. However, lower transaction fees due to muted deal activity offset the growth in advisory fees.<br/><br/>As of Mar 31, 2023, LaSalle had $78.5 billion of real estate assets under management (AUM), down from $79.1 billion as of Dec 31, 2022. This resulted from the decrease in dispositions and withdrawals, and net valuation, partially offset by the rise in foreign currency and acquisitions.",
			"JLL exited first-quarter 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $485.4 million, down from $519.3 million as of Dec 31, 2022.<br/><br/>As of Mar 31, 2023, the net leverage ratio was 1.9, up from 1.0 as of Dec 31, 2022, and 0.8 as of Mar 31, 2022. The corporate liquidity was $1.7 billion as of the same date.<br/><br/>The company did not repurchase any shares during the first quarter.<br/><br/>JLL currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).<br/><br/>You can see <strong>the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.",

Quarterly revenues of $7.41 billion also compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.30 billion.<br/><br/>However, on a year-over-year basis, the core EPS declined by 34%. Revenues managed to increase 1.1%. Despite the challenging macro environment, CBRE Group benefited from the diversification across asset types, business lines, client types and geographies and the expansion of its resilient business in recent years, as well as cost-containment efforts.<br/><br/><strong>Public Storage</strong> PSA reported first-quarter 2023 core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $4.08, which increased 11.8% year over year. The core FFO per share, excluding the contribution from the company’s equity investment in PS Business Parks, Inc., was also $4.08, rising 16.2% from the year-ago quarter’s tally. Both figures surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and our estimate of $4.04.<br/><br/>PSA’s results reflected a better-than-anticipated top line, aided by an improvement in the realized annual rent per available square foot in the reported quarter. The company also benefited from its expansion efforts through acquisitions, developments and extensions. Furthermore, it revised its 2023 outlook.<br/><br/><strong>Iron Mountain Incorporated</strong> IRM reported first-quarter adjusted FFO per share of 97 cents, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents and our estimate of 92 cents. Moreover, the figure improved 6.6% from the year-ago quarter’s 91 cents, attributable to improved adjusted EBITDA.<br/><br/>Iron Mountain’s results reflect solid performance in the storage and service segments, and the data-center business. However, higher operating expenses in the quarter acted as a dampener. The company reaffirmed its outlook for 2023.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrea Behr, Associate Director of Corporate Communications. Please go ahead.",

			"Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's First Quarter Operating Results Conference Call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Jonathan Pong, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Finance. <br/>During this conference call, we will make statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-Q. (Operator Instructions). <br/>I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.",
			"<strong>Sumit Roy</strong>",
			"Thank you, Andrea. Welcome, everyone. We are pleased to report solid 2023 first quarter results, exhibiting continued momentum in our business. I would like to express my utmost gratitude to our one team whose efforts enable us to continue delivering on our growth objectives. I would also like to thank our equity and fixed income investors for their continued vote of confidence.<br/>Our team's efforts and the benefits of our size and scale were reflected in our first quarter results, highlighted by approximately $1.7 billion of high-quality investments acquired at a cash cap rate of 7%. This represents a 90 basis point increase compared to the investment cash cap rate we achieved in the fourth quarter of last year. and resulted in an investment spread of 163 basis points, which is above our historical averages. As we have experienced in prior cycles, cap rates for our investments after an adjustment period have historically tended to be positively correlated with interest rates, which is a trend we have largely continued to experience this year after the recent Horizon rates. <br/>Our ability to access well-priced capital has historically served as a competitive advantage and is a testament to our long history of maintaining a conservative balance sheet and a diversified real estate portfolio supported by clients who are leaders in their respective industries. Amidst an environment in which capital is expensive and are scarce for many of our clients, our value proposition is even more pronounced. <br/>This dynamic is reflected in the recent portfolio acquisitions we have announced, the active deal pipeline we see today and the favorable pricing spread we see for large portfolio transactions vis-a-vis one-off single asset transactions. Our differentiated platform extends beyond the external growth lens. Recently, we have taken steps to leverage the size of our portfolio and the history of our operating business through the continued development of advanced analytics. <br/>The objective of this initiative is to develop predictive and prescriptive insights that harness the collective proprietary data that we've accumulated over several decades of investing in managing and releasing single-tenant net lease properties. Our team's proprietary predictive analytic tool leverages the strove of information in our investment underwriting, portfolio management, asset management and development efforts enabling even more informed investment decisions made by our best-in-class One team members. <br/>As our business grows, so too will the predictive power of this tool, which we believe will generate significant value for our stakeholders as we refine the accuracy test conclusions and broaden scope across industries, property types and geographies. As part of our core investment thesis, our size and scale have created opportunities to serve as a capital provider for best-in-class partners looking for alternative means of financing given elevated debt costs. In the first quarter, we agreed to acquire up to 415 high-quality convenience stores from EG Group for $1.5 billion. Over 80% of the total portfolio annualized contractual rent is expected to be generated from properties under the Cumberland Farms brand, and we expect to close on this transaction in the second quarter. As illustrated by this deal, we believe our ability to offer not only certainty of close, but also attractively priced capital as a one-stop solution for sale-leaseback transactions is particularly valuable to institutional sellers of real estate today. We believe this will continue to expand our competitive advantage. <br/>Internationally, we continue to venture into new geographical verticals and grow the total addressable market opportunity. This quarter, we took advantage of favorable pricing internationally to acquire properties worth approximately $390 million at an initial cash lease yield of 7.6%. After our initial entry into international markets in 2019, we now derive 11.7% of total portfolio annualized contractual rent from those markets. <br/>This natural extension of our platform has been a pillar of growth for the last 4 years and is indicative of our ability to methodically establish and scale a new vertical. Given the continued momentum in our acquisitions pipeline and our progress to date, we are increasing our 2023 investment guidance to over $6 billion from our prior guidance of over $5 billion. Consistent with our investment strategy, we remain disciplined with regard to our balance sheet. Subsequent to our April bond offering, which settled on April 14. We held approximately $5.6 billion of liquidity, including unsettled forward equity totaling $1.5 billion. <br/>As a result, our current financial position has afforded us the ability to lean into near-term investment opportunities. Moving to operations. Our platform continues to generate durable cash flows, which support our stable earnings profile. For the first quarter, we are pleased to report occupancy of 99%, matching last quarter for the highest rate at the end of a reporting period in over 20 years. Additionally, we generated a 101.7% recapture rate across 176 renewed or new leases executed during the quarter. <br/>These results are a reflection of our talented asset management team and our unwavering commitment to core capital allocation principles, which include a focus on industry-leading clients who often operate in a low price point service-based or nondiscretionary industries. Our purposeful diversification across industries, geographies and clients and our emphasis on high-quality real estate locations and rigorous credit underwriting. Our investment philosophy is nuanced and not simply predicated upon the pursuit of investment-grade clients, which ended the first quarter at 40.8% of our annualized contractual rent. Many of our strongest operators, such as Sainsbury's have no public debt and thus are not rated at all. <br/>However, the consistency of their operations and health of their balance sheet are favorable attributes that are consistent with those of an investment-grade rated company. We estimate that approximately 5.3% of our annualized contractual rent comes from unrated operators without public debt. We remain committed to investments that offer us attractive risk-adjusted returns as evidenced throughout our history. And going forward, where we believe, based upon our disciplined underwriting and analytics, we are achieving better returns per unit of incremental risk. <br/>I would like to briefly touch on Cineworld which represents 1.3% of our annualized contractual rent. Despite the ongoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy, we have continued to receive 100% of contractual rent in the first quarter and through April. As of March 31, 2023, we had cumulative reserves of $33 million on our Cineworld properties. Outstanding receivables net of reserves and excluding straight-line receivables were $14.1 million. <br/>We remain in discussions with this client and we'll update the market on the outcome of these discussions at the appropriate time. Before turning the call over to Christie, I would like to highlight that in March, we published our third annual sustainability report which details our ongoing commitment to operating as a responsible corporate citizen for our stockholders, our team, the communities in which we operate and the environment. <br/>I'm proud of our continued progress on ESG initiatives as we seek to fulfill our commitment to building sustainable relationships and I strongly encourage all of today's listeners to navigate to the Sustainability page of our website to review the report. <br/>With that, I'd like to turn it over to Christie.",
			"<strong>Christie B. Kelly</strong>",
			"Thank you, Sumit. We work together with our clients and our One team to achieve a successful quarter on a number of fronts, delivering AFFO per share of $0.98 on behalf of all of our stakeholders. We would highlight that the comparable quarter in 2022 benefited from approximately $10.2 million of rental revenue reserve reversals, resulting in an AFFO per share growth headwind of approximately $0.015 per share in the first quarter of 2023.<br/>In addition, higher year-over-year short-term interest rates represented an approximate $0.02 growth headwind as our weighted average interest rate on revolver and commercial paper borrowings was approximately 300 basis points higher than it was in the comparative period in 2022 on a similar average borrowing base. Excluding these two items, our year-over-year AFFO per share growth rate was approximately 3.5% this quarter. As we evaluate the core fundamentals of our business, we remain focused upon delivering for our stakeholders over the long term and are encouraged by opportunities ahead. To that end, we are increasing the low end of our AFFO per share guidance range by $0.01 and resulting in a new range of $3.94 to $4.03, which represents 1.7% annual growth at the midpoint of the updated range. It has been a busy and productive start to the year on the capital raising front. Despite continued market volatility, we have raised approximately $3.9 billion of capital this year excluding $1.5 billion of unsettled forward equity. <br/>In April, we closed a $1 billion bond offering, which was comprised of $400 million of 4.7% senior unsecured notes due in 2028, and $600 million, a 4.9% senior unsecured notes due in 2033, resulted in a weighted average tenure of 8 years and semiannual yield to maturity of 5.05%. The issuance allowed us to satisfy our near-term debt issuance needs while reducing our exposure to variable rate revolver and commercial paper borrowings and to almost zero after our transaction closed on April 14. In March, we increased our dividend for the 120th time since our public listing in 1994, and to an annual rate of $3.06 per share, representing 3.2% growth from the prior year period. Providing a stable and growing dividend is core to our mission at Realty Income, and we take great pride in being one of only 66 constituents in the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index for having raised our dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years. <br/>I would like to thank our One team whose focus and diligence has paved the way for our continued growth as we build upon our track record of consistency. And with that, I would like to turn it back over to Sumit.",
			"<strong>Sumit Roy</strong>",
			"Thank you, Christie. In conclusion, during periods of market uncertainty or dislocation, we look to unearth value by leveraging the inherent advantages of our platform. These trends include our continued access to relatively attractively priced capital and our portfolio scale, which we seek to leverage to produce unique investment opportunities as a leading sale-leaseback capital provider. When combined with the collective talents of our best-in-class team members to source, underwrite and close on creative acquisition opportunities with strong risk-adjusted returns, we believe we are very well positioned to continue amplifying our competitive advantages on behalf of our clients and stakeholders. We thank all our stakeholders for their support, loyalty and trust in our company. <br/>And with that, we can open it up for questions.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) Today's first question comes from Nate Crossett with BNP Paribas.",
			"<strong>Nathan Daniel Crossett</strong>",
			"I was wondering if you could talk about just deal flow U.S. versus Europe. What was the amount of deals you looked at in the quarter? I think that's a number you usually give. And then on cap rates, last year, the spread of like the cap rates in the U.S. and Europe was pretty low. I think it was almost the same. But this quarter, you're up 60 basis points wider I just want to know if there's anything to note there.",
			"<strong>Sumit Roy</strong>",
			"Yes. Thank you for your questions, Nate. Good questions. Let's start with the sourcing numbers. For this quarter, we sourced about $16 billion worth of product, 25% of which was in the international markets. I would say that if you go back to when we started going into the international markets, the composition of international versus U.S. has been roughly around 30%, 70% in that ZIP code, plus/minus 5%. <br/>So this is pretty much within that particular range. What you might have noticed, however, is the amount of closing more recently, both in the fourth quarter of last year,and the first quarter of this year. The contribution from the international side has been a little bit lower than what you have traditionally seen. I would say that the international business has contributed about 35% of volume in terms of what we end up closing versus closer to 20%, 22% this particular quarter. And the main reason for that is we saw a delay in adjustments on the cap rate side in the international markets vis-a-vis the U.S. markets. We started to see cap rate expansion in the U.S. towards the end of -- middle of third quarter, fourth quarter and obviously through the first quarter of this year. <br/>But we didn't quite have the same experience in the U.K. market and some of the other international markets, till, I would say, towards the end of the fourth quarter. And what was largely making potential sellers reconsider the market was not so much driven by actual trades taking place, but more idiosyncratic to their particular needs. Around redemption issues or refinancings that were coming near term. And that's largely what's driven these opportunistic transactions that we've gotten over the finish line in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of last -- this year. And that's what's resulted in cap rates being substantially higher than what I would call the norm or what we are seeing in the everyday market in some of these international markets. So that explains the 60 basis point higher cap rate that we were able to achieve. And I might add, this is excellent product largely driven by idiosyncratic issues being experienced by buyers who wanted to get this off their books to meet some of the things that I've just discussed. So that's the dynamic we've seen that.",
			"<strong>Nathan Daniel Crossett</strong>",
			"Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just one quick one on development yields. Those are notably below the acquisition yields. Are those just on commitments before rates moved? Or maybe you can describe what's happening there?",
			"<strong>Sumit Roy</strong>",
			"Yes. And Nate, you've hit the nail on the head. It's exactly that. As you know, development obligations have a much longer lead time. So a lot of what you see in -- you saw in the fourth quarter, third quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, though it's starting to move up. It hasn't moved quite as quickly, largely because what you're seeing filtered through the investment numbers, but transactions that we had struck, I would say, 3 quarters ago or 4 quarters ago. But you should expect to see the yield on development creep closer to what we are actually experiencing in the traditional acquisitions market over the next couple of quarters. So it's just a timing issue.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And our next question today comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.",
			"<strong>Bradley Barrett Heffern</strong>",
			"Christie, I was wondering if you could talk through some of the puts and takes on guidance and why only the $0.01 increase at the low end given the increase in the acquisition guidance and the expense categories moving in the right direction.",
			"<strong>Christie B. Kelly</strong>",
			"Absolutely, Brad. I think first, in terms of what Sumit had discussed and the increase of our acquisitions guidance to over $6 billion, we remain conservative in that front and really looking towards the second half of the year, while things remain strong. As Sumit has discussed, we're really -- wait and see here as things unfold. I think the other thing, too, in terms of guidance that we've articulated, and I mentioned some of this in my prepared remarks, is really the headwinds that we're seeing from a debt perspective, although we've been very focused on ensuring that we're derisking our balance sheet, and you can see that in the transactions that we've executed through April. <br/>We're really looking at where that may unfold in terms of the second half of the year and don't believe that, that will alleviate over and above the competitive cost of capital that we've been able to generate vis-a-vis last year. And I think finally, in terms of the positive trends that you saw in terms of the tightening of the guidance with G&amp;A, we remain particularly disciplined during this macroeconomic backdrop, and are focused on managing our G&amp;A. But further to that, it's the benefits of size and scale. And you can see that over the years in terms of the trends of G&amp;A to revenues. <br/>And then finally, from an unreimbursed property expense margin perspective and the tightening there, we're just following in on the positive trends that we've been able to execute on.",
			"<strong>Bradley Barrett Heffern</strong>",
			"Okay. And then, Sumit, just thinking about this EG Group deal, are you seeing more of these very large sale-leaseback opportunities versus what you would normally see? And then has the competition for those deals also thinned out?",
			"<strong>Sumit Roy</strong>",
			"No, no, Brad. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's timed out. In fact, the momentum has continued, and we expect that momentum to remain strong. I don't know how many billion-plus deals, but these large transactions will be what drives some of the near-term financing issues that a lot of companies are going to have to deal with. And with what we are seeing play out in the banking sector with fewer banks out there to provide capital, the cost of that capital being what it is, given the interest rate environment, I do believe that sale leaseback will continue to be a very attractive alternative to raise capital to help address financing needs at these companies. <br/>Keep in mind, EG had never done a sale leaseback. They had that option for many, many years. And they chose to go down this path largely to address some of the leverage concerns that they had on the balance sheet. And we expect that trend to continue, and that's the reason why that's the impetus behind why we felt we should increase our acquisition guidance by $1 billion.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question today comes from Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America.",
			"<strong>Joshua Dennerlein</strong>",
			"Just a follow-up on the EG Group deal. Just curious how that deal came together and maybe your ability to partner up further with them?",
			"<strong>Sumit Roy</strong>",
			"Thanks for the question, Josh. So EG is obviously a very well-established name in the U.K. market. Neil and I had been calling on them for a while, along with TDR Capital, they're capital providers for a while. And this is a relationship where we knew they didn't have a high level of interest in necessarily going down the path of sale leaseback financing, when we first started to have conversations with them. <br/>But I think that, that relationship ultimately played out to our benefit when we were awarded the deal when they did choose to go down the path of sale leaseback to help meet some of their capital needs shorter term. This was a competitive process. It was run by [Eastdil]. We went through. We were obviously in close contact with EG directly as well. And there were three finalists, and we felt like we were awarded the deal based on our reputation, surety of close and the fact that we had spent time developing a relationship with them. So that's what really got us the deal at the end. And our ability to be creative and there were certain asks that they had and our ability to meet those certain asks also, I believe, accrue to our favor. So I think all of those factors went towards us being awarded the transaction despite us not being the highest bidder.",
			"<strong>Joshua Dennerlein</strong>",
			"Okay. And then maybe changing the topic a little bit. How do you guys think about expanding or growing your exposure to lower credit quality tenants as a way to kind of widen the aperture and maintain growth?",
			"<strong>Sumit Roy</strong>",
			"Yes. Josh, that's a very good question. I'm actually going to go back to the EG Group conversation we just had. If you look at the actual portfolio, 80% of the portfolio is Cumberland Farms. And I just want to remind the group that 3 years ago, when Cumberland Farms was available for sale, they were all of the natural operators that we're very, very interested in this very well-run private company. And what was being bandied about as a potential sale leaseback. The pricing was in the low 5s, high 4 ZIP code. And it ended up being EG Group that won the transaction, and they obviously didn't want any sale-leaseback financing to effectuate the buyout. But that was the quality of the real estate, that Cumberland Farms was demanding at that particular time. <br/>Fast forward today, the 4-wall coverages on these assets have only improved and improved, I would say, dramatically. So the assets remain exactly the same assets, and we were able to accomplish this transaction at 6.9%. Yes, if you look at EG Group, the credit that's operating these assets, they are sub-investment grade. But if you look at the quality of the assets, it's exactly the same. And we believe that EG Group is a very good operator of convenience store business. We can see that in the history that they have established in the U.K., and we certainly see it in the performance of these assets. When you compare it to where they were performing 3 years ago and was warranting a price in the low 5s, high 4s to where we were able to accomplish. So now you fast forward and you say, okay, you're getting 150, 160 basis points of additional spread on this real estate. Are you being paid for the credit risk inherent in the operator, and that's where the concept of risk-adjusted returns comes into play for us, and it is so front and center in everything we do. The answer for us was a resounding, yes. We are being compensated. And so for us, we've said this before that investment grade rating is a byproduct of the actual underwriting. It is not something that we seek out. It gets taken into consideration on the collectibility of the rent flow over the 20-year or 25-year leases that we underwrite to. But ultimately, we look at every transaction on a risk-adjusted basis. And if it makes sense, despite the fact that it may or may not have investment-grade rating is something that we are going to continue to pursue.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And our next question today comes from Michael Goldsmith of UBS.",
			"<strong>Michael Goldsmith</strong>",
			"So you started the call by talking about continued momentum in the business. Can you just talk a little -- REITs tend to be lagging indicators. So can you kind of talk about the visibility that you have into the business and this continued momentum? Just trying to better understand how long of a path that you have where you feel very good about the spreads and the backdrop? Because it seems like it's been -- everything has been pretty solid in the last several quarters.",
			"<strong>Sumit Roy</strong>",
			"Yes. That's a great question, Michael. Things are moving so fast. Every other day, there's a bank in the news. News is super fast. And so how do we think about our business and why do I use phrases like continued momentum. Even though this may be a lagging indicator, we are looking at transactions -- these renewals every day. And when we are seeing the fact that we can still continue to generate 102%, 103% re-leasing spreads, yes, it's lagging, but literally weeks, months. And it gives me continued hope that, look, for our product, where we play in the market, et cetera, there continues to be a fair amount of demand. <br/>And it manifests itself in some of the positive re-leasing spreads that we share with the market. The second piece, which is much more of a forward-looking statement is what are the continued discussions that we are having that then helps drive our pipeline on the investment side. What are the kinds of discussions that we are having? What's the size of the discussions that we're having, what's the yield associated with those discussions. I think all of that gives us confidence that there continues to be momentum. The fact that we were able to raise $3.1 billion within a period of 3 months, in the fixed income market, the fact that we were able to close on $800 million of equity and have $1.5 million of unsettled equity available -- $1 billion, sorry, of unsettled equity again, continues to give me confidence that even on our capital side, for us, we continue to sit in a very favorable position. So we have the opportunity. We have the ability to raise capital. <br/>We have the ability to make spreads north of what we have historically achieved. And now with the international markets starting to reflect a little bit more of a positive movement for us on the cap rate side. That's what gives me confidence to say that we have continued momentum in the business.",
			"<strong>Michael Goldsmith</strong>",
			"My follow-up question is, it looks like you've opened up an office in Amsterdam. Can you talk a little bit about the advantage that you get from that? Should -- does that mean that we should expect more international deals? Or does this allow you to source deals better throughout Europe? And are there any tax benefits from having an office there?",
			"<strong>Sumit Roy</strong>",
			"Yes. The reason why we needed to open an office in the Netherlands was largely driven by the structure that we have created to allow us the flexibility to continue to grow in the international markets. And by international markets, I primarily mean the U.K. and Western Europe. This was largely driven by a substance question around having or needing to have employees based in Amsterdam to be able to satisfy this tax structure that we've been able to create to give us this flexibility. So that's largely what's driven a couple of hires that we've made. But most of the other hires will continue to be in the U.K. and potentially in some of these other countries as we begin to reach a core size in terms of our portfolio. So -- yes, that's what really drove setting up an office in the Netherlands and hiring a few folks who can help us manage our international business.",

			"And our next question today comes from Harsh Hemnani with Green Street.",
			"<strong>Harsh Hemnani</strong>",
			"So we've heard from some of your peers that perhaps cap rates in the U.S. are closer to topping out. Is that something during the second quarter that you're seeing too? And then the contrast that perhaps in the -- in Europe, you mentioned cap rates only started moving there in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of 2023. Do you still see more runway there and perhaps that being a tailwind for you relative to peers? And the spirit of this question is not to say that as European cap rates going to expand over the 76, I understand that those idiosyncratic deals might not happen every quarter, but is the trend that you're seeing in Europe upwards? And can that benefit your spread relative to peers?",
			"<strong>Sumit Roy</strong>",
			"Yes. Thank you for your question, Harsh. I wouldn't go so far as to say that we see cap rates moving even more in the international markets than they have here in the U.S. I mean, just look at where our 10-year bonds are the price is literally one on top of the other. So they're on those advantages today that we had a year ago. So I don't expect that to be a disproportionate movement in one geography or the other. Could we see situations, however, unique situations that present themselves that is largely driven by -- you used the word idiosyncratic issues, yes. And that could garner additional cap rates. But as a market, on average, I don't see there being that much more of an advantage in one market over the other in terms of cap rates. And you're right, you said it correctly that the movement in cap rates was slower in Europe than it was here in the U.S., but I think they've largely caught up. Like some of our peers, it is fair to say that we have not seen continued expansion of cap rates vis-a-vis what we've experienced over the last, call it, 1.5 months, 2 months. But that's not to say that cap rates could not continue to move.<br/>There's just a lot of uncertainty in the market today with banks as soon as we start to believe that the banking crisis is behind us, there's another name that pops up. And as you know, a lot of these regional banks were the lifeblood of providing financing to developers and to other local real estate operators. And so is it possible that those situations could again manifest itself in for sales, where we could be the beneficiary, which could then have an impact on cap rates. Yes, it's possible. That is why I hesitate to say that the movements in cap rates have played out and it's going to remain where it is today. But I think just like our peers, there has been a settling out, if you will, of cap rates that we have experienced, but I'm not sure if I subscribe to the fact that this game has played out.",
			"<strong>Harsh Hemnani</strong>",
			"All right. That's helpful color. And then you've mentioned in the past couple of calls where vacant asset sales that your income have been going up. Past couple of quarters, all asset sales were weak in. And you said this is kind of going to be the normal course of business, where if that's the best use for those assets and we have better uses for the capital to go out and buy something accretive? That's going to be what you will do. Can you give us a sense for what the buyer pool for these assets look like? Has that changed at all? -- the demand for these assets over the past couple of years and say versus pre-COVID?",
			"<strong>Sumit Roy</strong>",
			"That's a tough question, Harsh. What we are experiencing is there is a price for any asset. And if you are willing to accept the price, I think you pretty much can sell an asset. All of what we have accomplished in the first quarter were vacant sales because that's all we really needed to address. And it was about a 6% unlevered IRR, which is lower than what we have traditionally experienced, largely driven by 1 or 2 assets that we just wanted to get rid of because we felt like the long-term prospects or even the short-term prospects for that matter, didn't justify us holding on to these assets. But if you look back, it's traditionally been in that high single-digit unlevered IRR. <br/>So it gets into the double-digit levered return profile. And that's what we've traditionally experienced. And I think we should be able to go back to that. In terms of the profile of the buyers in this market, I would say most of the buyers that are interested in buying these assets are folks who want to operate out of these assets. They don't want to enter into a lease. They want to control the assets. These tend to be not institutional quality buyers, but local buyers that want to run a business out of that location and want to own the real estate to do so. That's the profile. Now in the past, we used to have, I would throw developers in the mix. And of course, developers keep sniffing around. But given that the debt markets are a little bit more challenging, there's a little less perhaps demand from that ilk of potential buyers. But I would say today, it's largely owner operators that are driving the sales process.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And our next question today comes from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank.",
			"<strong>Greg Michael McGinniss</strong>",
			"so just touching on sale leaseback again. I have to imagine there's more operators newly considering sale-leaseback financing. Can you just talk about the types of tenants you're having first-time conversations with, who you might be targeting? I don't know if that's cold calls or through brokers or whatever have happens to be and how you go about finding operators that maybe didn't consider sale leasebacks in the past, but would be open to it now.",
			"<strong>Sumit Roy</strong>",
			"Yes, it's a slew of avenues through which we source and I think it will be very consistent across the board. Obviously, we believe -- we have a curated list of folks that we've been reaching out to speaking with one of which we've already talked about, EG Group, that we didn't have expectations of sale leaseback in the near term, but it just so happened that, that became very compelling to them as a capital source. <br/>There are similar names like that. I'm not going to obviously go into the details, as you can imagine, Greg. But this is something that we do here in the U.S. We do this very consistently when we travel to the U.K. and to Western Europe. There are obviously well identified folks who own a lot of real estate who are not in the real estate business, and those are the folks that we've sort of identified and tried to reach out through -- the other channels are the more traditional channels, brokers, investment bankers, colleagues who may have worked in certain places who have an in into those places. All of those are avenues that we exhaust to continue to source our transactions. And those continue to remain the avenues of our sourcing.",
			"<strong>Greg Michael McGinniss</strong>",
			"Okay. And then I guess just talking about source deal volume a bit here, kind of a multi-parter. So first, when you're talking about source deal volume, does that include the deals where sellers just have unrealistic cap rate expectations. Secondly, do you have some idea or some sense of the level of sellers that maybe are just waiting on the sidelines waiting for financial markets to settle out a bit. And third, how much of the deal volume in the past, do you think it was driven by cap rates trending down, which was enhancing exit IRRs that now is probably a thing of the past.",
			"<strong>Sumit Roy</strong>",
			"So Greg, to answer your first question, yes, even when the cap rate expectations are unreasonable. If somebody is reaching out to us and we've sourced it as a deal, but have no interest in following up, it does get included in our source volume. I would say that a lot of folks, a lot of potential sellers of real estate are sitting on the sidelines. They recognize that the buyer pool is definitely a lot more discerning when it comes to cap rates because they are having to work in the same environment where the cost of that capital is much higher today than it was 6 months ago. <br/>So rather than tainting their product, they're just holding back. And I think look, I can't prove this 100%. But if you look at our sourcing numbers, it's $16 billion, $17 billion, $18 billion. Those were the three numbers that we had the last 3 quarters. But it is slightly lower than the $25 billion, $26 billion that we were experiencing in the first 2 quarters of last year and quarters before that. So some of it is obviously getting played out in the sourcing numbers as well. It's still a very healthy sourcing number. But I think as people wait longer and longer and this turmoil continues, I think we are going to start to see some of these sellers come in and say, look, I have an event, either it be re-leasing -- refinancing scenario or what have you, that's going to push them to say, okay, we are willing to accept the fact that we need a higher cap rate. We've had a few of those occasions where 5 months ago or 4 months ago, we had a grocery operator that came in and they wanted a particular cap rate, and we said that was too rich for us. And we said, okay, this is where we think we could have done that deal. This was about 5 months ago. <br/>They've come back to us today saying, \"Can you meet that? And we said, no, we can't. Our cost of capital has moved, but we could do this. And they are willing to transact at that higher level today. So I know this is one anecdotal evidence of how it's taking time, which is why there's always a lag, but it is starting to play itself out. And I do expect sourcing numbers to start to go out. The longer this turmoil on the lending side continues, which obviously creates wonderful opportunities for us.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And our next question today comes from Eric Wolfe of Citibank.",
			"<strong>Eric Wolfe</strong>",
			"I wanted to follow up on what you just said a moment ago and also your comments around the new banks sort of being in the headlines every other day. Just curious whether anything that's happening right now with regional banks has already started to open up new opportunities for you. I'm specifically thinking about industries that rely on their credit. I think you mentioned some local developers. But just anything that relies on regional bank credit where you might see some opportunities today that were historically available to you?",
			"<strong>Sumit Roy</strong>",
			"Yes. I think, Eric, on multiple fronts, it opens up opportunities for us. Obviously, sale-leaseback as a comparative tool to raise capital especially when compared against the debt products that's available today, it's very compelling. The cost of that capital raise is lower than what markets are able to satisfy. So I think from the traditional source, it's going to create opportunities. it's also going to create opportunities because you don't have as many lenders today who would have traditionally participated in -- on the secured side of the equation. And there are users of that capital stack that still need to either refinance their capital or just want to raise that in view of doing a sale leaseback. And because of fewer participants, I do think you can position yourself to play in that area because it's very akin to your traditional underwriting with obviously a few more nuances around how you think about debt instruments as an investment. But I think it's going to open up opportunities on that front as well. And a lot of these alternative capital asset managers and capital providers, et cetera, I think they are very well situated to take advantage of those situations as are we.",
			"<strong>Eric Wolfe</strong>",
			"That's helpful. And then just a question on theaters. I know small percentage for you. But I'm just curious what you think needs to happen for there to be a more liquid market for assets. And maybe for Cineworld, specifically, once their balance sheet and leases presumably restructured, do you think there will be a market to sell those assets?",
			"<strong>Sumit Roy</strong>",
			"I think so, Eric. Look, this is consistent with what I've been saying specifically around in a world we remain in discussions. So I'm not going to get into that. There was some news this morning, which I think is very positive for the Cineworld name, where they've actually put out a date when they're planning on emerging. They've been able to attract new capital. So I think all of that is quite positive. But what I have shared on our specific portfolio is around inbounds. There are certain locations that are absolutely in high demand for alternative uses. So in some ways, this is playing out of what is the highest and best use of some of these locations. And going through this process accelerates that ultimate outcome. And so we are -- look, we think we're going to be just fine. <br/>It is, like you said, a very small portion of our overall portfolio. To be very honest, I'm very hopeful that by the time we have our next quarterly call that this will all be behind us. And these opportunities that I've been referencing about basically repositioning some of these assets to an alternative use can start to play out, and we can actually start speaking to you about what those opportunities are. But we feel pretty good about the Cineworld situation.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And our next question today comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.",
			"<strong>Unidentified Analyst</strong>",
			"This is Ravi Vaidya on the line for Haendel St. Juste. Last quarter, you commented that your watch list is about of 4% of total ABR. Just wondering what that is right now? And what other categories outside of the theaters are you monitoring or have a negative view on?",
			"<strong>Sumit Roy</strong>",
			"Yes. Good question. Our watch list today is right around 4.4%. As you correctly pointed out, it is largely dominated by the theater industry. Some of the other areas that we are continuing to look at. And keep in mind that our watch list is not always a credit issue. It is just our view on the real estate, the location of that real estate and what the ultimate outcome is going to look like. So it's a combination of credit. It's a combination of real estate underwriting. But ultimately, the watch list is dictated by the long-term desirability of those locations and operators. So along with the theaters, I would say, restaurants are in the some of the more discretionary type concepts out there like home furnishing. <br/>There are very few day care centers and some of the other businesses that are not very well capitalized that you'll find there. But that's the mists of what you will find on the on the watch list.",
			"<strong>Unidentified Analyst</strong>",
			"That's helpful. One more here. One of your peers sold movie theaters at [7.8], regarding your -- would you consider selling theaters in that range? Or what other -- what are your conversations been like in terms of pricing and regarding the theaters, as you said it was such a large component of the watch list?",
			"<strong>Sumit Roy</strong>",
			"Yes. That's actually a very good pricing. And I suspect that the person that bought it is probably a developer. And we've done our own analysis. And for us, we feel like the best way to create value would be to hold on to these assets and then especially the ones where we have a view that can be redeveloped et cetera, and capture that view once we have full control of that asset. We truly told there is so much discussion that we are having with Cineworld at this point that I don't want to get into the details, but that discussion needs to be behind us. And my understanding is that a lot of these assets that are now going to be put out there for sale, et cetera, have already had their rents renegotiated, everything has already been priced in. And those cap rates that are being shared are being shared off of those new adjusted rent numbers. <br/>And in our view, if we feel like, hey, let's just hold on to these assets, we'd much rather get these assets back and reposition it perhaps with some additional capital, but create much more value for our investors, then that's what we choose to do. And we haven't engaged in trying to go out and try to find the market we've had a lot of unsolicited calls. I can tell you that, but we really haven't engaged in trying to sell any of our theater assets. We want to resolve the Cineworld situation. And I think with the news today, I think that date is certainly getting closer before we start to figure out what the best economic outcome is.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.",
			"<strong>Ronald Kamdem</strong>",
			"A couple of quick ones. Just going back to the opening comments on the international portfolio at 11.7%. Just thinking about where could that number go? Obviously, there's different tax it so forth. But in your mind, how can that number trend in the next couple of years, obviously, opportunity driven.",
			"<strong>Sumit Roy</strong>",
			"Well, these last couple of quarters, they have still represented 20%, 25% of our transaction volume. So clearly, that 11% over time should continue to drift up. It was drifting up at a much higher clip when we were doing a lot more transactions. And I do expect for us to get back into that more normalized 30%, 35%, maybe even more if certain situations play out. So I'm hopeful to keep growing our pie. Look, we continue to look at new geographies, and especially at a time like this, new geographies that seemed a bit out of our reach are starting to become a little bit more within our reach and more compelling today. So as we keep adding new geographies, as we continue to enhance our relationships, et cetera, I see this number 11% continue to grow and be a bigger part of the overall portfolio.",
			"<strong>Ronald Kamdem</strong>",
			"Great. And then if I could just touch on sort of two verticals: one, consumer-centric medical to gaming, which I don't think has been mentioned before, but just a quick update on what the opportunity set is looking like? Has it slowed down with the events over the past couple of weeks and so forth? And how are you guys thinking about those?",
			"<strong>Sumit Roy</strong>",
			"So gaming continues to be of tremendous interest to us, Ron. It's just hard to replicate what we got with the Boston asset. And we have an amazing partner in Craig at win, and we will continue to try to work on trying to find new transactions that I don't know if we'll ever be able to replicate the one in Boston, but of a similar type of a similar dominance in particular markets. So we are looking at transactions. We are looking at transactions every day. And the pricing expectations is perhaps something that we are still trying to work through. And if we can get to an understanding which works for parties involved, I think, and I hope we are able to grow that part of our business, but it's not a fait accompli. I mean it is -- the bar for us is higher. But the good news is there is a product out there that meets that bar. So we are very hopeful. With consumer-centric, we -- that's a business we love. We've been in that business. We've just coined the phrase to sort of define an area of our portfolio that we've obviously been very interested in. And with the dental transaction that we did in the fourth quarter of last year, that helped accelerate that part of the business. <br/>Look -- and I don't want to get into the thesis again. I think we've shared that already for a variety of reasons, we like that business. And I think in some ways, this is a business that is getting defined right in front of our eyes, and we want to participate in the potential upside that I see on the real estate side. And so again, partnering with the right operators, forward-thinking operators who share a similar philosophy of delivery of healthcare, I think will, I hope, result in a slew of transactions for us on the consumer-centric side. So both those areas remain of high interest to us, Ron.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And our next question comes from John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann.",
			"<strong>John James Massocca</strong>",
			"Both on the our market here. So I just have one question. Obviously, there was a same-store decline in Cedars, which was kind of explained, but there was also a same-store decline in your QSR portfolio. I'm just kind of wondering what was driving that. Is that some of the credit issues certain franchise operators had earlier this year or something else that's kind of idiosyncratic?",
			"<strong>Sumit Roy</strong>",
			"No, no. It's -- look, the overall same-store decline was largely a function of what Christie touched on to explain why our AFFO per share was flat. It was basically -- if you look at the reversals we took in the first quarter of versus the reversals that we took in 2023 first quarter. There was a net $9 million reversal that was very positive in the first quarter of 2022 that we didn't have we had to compare against in this quarter. And when you look at same-store calculation, obviously, that's what drove that very benign same-store growth number.<br/>Absent that, if you were looking at just the core portfolio, our growth would have been 1.5%. The specifics around QSR is more driven by a couple of concepts that are not doing very well. Boston market continues to be in the news. It's a very small portion of our overall allocation, I think, basis points at this point. But that is what drags the same-store sales numbers same-store growth numbers for that particular industry. So it's very specific to a couple of names. But overall, like I said, we were around at 1.5%, had it not been for these reversals in the first quarter of last year.",
			"<strong>John James Massocca</strong>",
			"Okay. And maybe what's the overall view on kind of the franchise restaurant base that kind of rough turn of the year, but have things stabilized at all given kind of the continued strength of the consumer? Or just kind of when you talk to tenants when you look at new deals, what's the outlook there for that specific tenant industry?",
			"<strong>Sumit Roy</strong>",
			"Yes. It's what you would expect, John, Casual dining is depending on the concepts, some concepts continue to post very good results. Like Outback, I saw the results not too long ago. They had positive same-store growth. I think (inaudible) has had a similar story. But then you look at other concepts, they're not doing as well. Thankfully, the two that I mentioned are our two largest exposures. But we do have some smaller concepts. And it's a smaller concept that if they don't have the balance sheet wherewithal to increase prices or pass through some of the costs, et cetera. they're going to struggle. And again, it's not -- none of this is a big part of our portfolio and all of which there are areas that we are focused on. It's already part of our watch list. But that's where I expect to see some level of disruption, but nothing new is expected based on what we see today.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies.",
			"<strong>Linda Tsai</strong>",
			"Just a quick one. Just a broader question on the overall market. When you look at the amount of dry powder available on the sidelines to deploy towards net lease, which industries are you seeing the most demand?",
			"<strong>Sumit Roy</strong>",
			"That's an interesting one, Linda. If we just look at it and I look back, I think it's convenience stores and grocery. Those are the industries that we we're able to do the most deals in and -- but that's a selective selection bias that we have. Those are the industries we like. And so I can't answer that across the board. But what I will tell you is, yes, you're right, there's a lot of capital, but that cost of capital is not uniform. <br/>That's one of our biggest advantages that we have a cost of capital that continues to be incredibly competitive and lower than almost everyone. So in some ways, we find ourselves in a very favorable position to take advantage of what we are seeing in the market. But we are very focused on areas of interest to us.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn it back over to the management team for any closing remarks.",
			"<strong>Sumit Roy</strong>",
			"Thank you all for your attendance today. We look forward to meeting with many of you at the upcoming NAREIT conference in June. Thank you.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day."

			"<strong>Ryan C. Burke</strong>",
			"Thank you, Britney. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm here with Joe Russell; and Tom Boyle. Before we begin, we want to remind you that certain matters discussed during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

			"<strong>Joseph D. Russell</strong>",
			"Thank you, Ryan, and thank you for joining us today. Public Storage had a very good start to 2023. We remain focused on leading the self-storage industry's digital evolution, transforming our own operating model and enhancing and growing the portfolio. In the quarter, we achieved new milestones on several of our key initiatives, which included exceeding 60% of customers choosing to move in through our e-rental online lease; eclipsing 2 million downloads of the Public Storage mobile app; reaching 400 properties on our customer demand-driven digital operating platform; installing solar at more than 200 properties, putting us on track to complete at least 1,000 property installations within the next 3 years; completion of over 70% of the Property of Tomorrow enhancement program; growing NOI by 29% across the 529 acquisition and development properties in our non-same-store pool; and driving the industry's largest development pipeline to an excess of $1 billion to be delivered over the next 24 months.<br/>We had a strong operating performance in the first quarter, particularly with existing customers performing well and same-store move-in volume up nearly 13%. Length of stays are strong and same-store revenues were up nearly 10% year-over-year. Our exceptionally large non-same-store acquisition and development pool, now nearly 25% of the overall portfolio continues to outperform as well. Fundamentally, self-storage is a needs-based business with demand drivers that are multidimensional and fluid throughout economic cycles.<br/>We also continue to benefit from people spending more time at home, which has increasing permanence with remote and hybrid work here to stay. Additionally, with the return to more seasonal patterns of demand, we are currently also seeing an uptick in movement activity that has continued into the second quarter. We also continue to find good opportunity in development and redevelopment as well with a vibrant pipeline poised to generate growth for years to come.<br/>Our unique ability to weather economic cycles serves us well, particularly while other developers have slowed their activity due to higher interest rates, cost pressures, difficult municipal processes and concern over the near macro-term landscape. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss acquisition market and financial performance.",
			"<strong>H. Thomas Boyle</strong>",
			"Thanks, Joe. The transaction market has been relatively quiet to start the year as potential sellers feel out the macro environment, higher interest rates and the spread between buyer and seller expectations. That said, we have closed or are under contract to acquire nearly $200 million, right on track for our $750 million outlook for the year. The vast majority of our acquisitions this year have been done off-market quietly. More recently, we've been encouraged by an increase in inbounds, which are primarily small- to medium-sized portfolios.<br/>We're in a great position to acquire today given our cost and access to capital advantages, paired with our industry-leading NOI margins. Now on to financial performance. As Joe mentioned, we started the year strong, reporting core FFO of $4.08 for the quarter, representing 16.2% growth over the first quarter of '22, excluding the contribution from PSB.<br/>Looking at the components. In the same-store, our revenue increased 9.8% compared to the first quarter of '22. We drove strong move-in volumes up 13% during the quarter, heading into our peak leasing season, and the existing tenant base remains strong with length of stays sitting at records. Same-store cost of operations were up 5.6%, leading to total net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties growing 11.2% for the quarter.<br/>In addition to the same-store, the lease-up and performance of the recently acquired and developed facilities remained a standout in the quarter, growing 29% compared to last year. Shifting to the outlook. We lifted our outlook for the year, driven by increasing our same-store revenue assumptions. While the macro environment remains uncertain, performance to date has been encouraging. We're set up well heading into the second quarter.<br/>Last but not least, our capital and liquidity position remains rock solid. Our net leverage of 3.3x combined with $700 million of cash on hand at quarter end, puts us in a very strong position for capital allocation as we move through the year. Now I'll turn it back to Joe.",
			"<strong>Joseph D. Russell</strong>",
			"Thanks, Tom. Our people, technologies, platforms, balance sheet and brand have and will be continually enhanced to create and strengthen the competitive advantages we have across the entire Public Storage enterprise. We see opportunity in the current environment and are poised to execute with focus on delivering growth and value for our shareholders. Let's go ahead and open the call up for questions.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) <br/>And we will take our first question from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.",
			"<strong>Juan Carlos Sanabria</strong>",
			"Joe or Tom, I was just hoping you could speak to April trends and what you're seeing in terms of demand and/or price sensitivity from customers out there? Any -- some of your peers have talked to some softness in March or April depending on their market exposure. Just curious what you guys are seeing across your platform?",
			"<strong>H. Thomas Boyle</strong>",
			"Yes. Thanks for the question, Juan. As we move through the quarter, and you could hear it in the prepared remarks, we saw continued strength in move-in volumes and interest into our system. And so as we move through March and into April, that trend continued. I wouldn't characterize March as weak, but I would characterize April as strong. And so we've seen accelerating move-in volume growth as we move through what was a strong margin into a stronger April. <br/>One of the things you highlighted there was existing customer sensitivity to price. And I'd also note that we haven't seen anything concerning there. Price sensitivity has been very in line with our expectations. And so against that backdrop, seeing good move-in volumes, which is encouraging, in particular, as we head into the next several months.",
			"<strong>Juan Carlos Sanabria</strong>",
			"And then just for my second question, just on the Property of Tomorrow spend. You guys have made excellent progress on deploying that capital. Just curious on the types of returns you're generating as you look at the CapEx that you've spent. And how that's augmented growth either in the same-store, non-same-store pool?",
			"<strong>Joseph D. Russell</strong>",
			"So to step back, Juan, the program has been quite well received by both customers, our employees. And now that we're at a point where we're actually getting to full market completion in several of our key markets as we finish up and round out the program over the next couple of years, we're actually seeing very good response and overall look just to the -- again, the image and the power of the brand, particularly where we've got meaningful scale in many, many markets. So we continue to track and see the benefits from that. It's continuing to enhance our present market-to-market. <br/>And with that, we continue to be very excited about getting the program completed. The team has done a very nice job figuring out any and all ways to optimize the amount of volume we're actually going to pull it in, plus or minus a year earlier than we intended to. And with that, we'll be in a very good position nationally to have elevated, the crisp and enhanced brand attributes that play well in many parts of our business.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"We will take our next question from Michael Goldsmith with UBS.",
			"<strong>Michael Goldsmith</strong>",
			"My first question is on the guidance. You brought up the low end. Is that a reflection of the trends that you've already experienced in the first quarter? Or that guidance -- the low end of your range was based on a full recession scenario. Is the increase in guidance more reflective of that, that outcome is less likely to occur? And then within this, you've included this quote in your supplemental that suggests that the potential of revenue growth rates is wide and including the potential for year-over-year declines in revenue in the second half of the year. Is there anything that you saw in the first quarter that changes your view on that?",
			"<strong>H. Thomas Boyle</strong>",
			"I would characterize the first quarter as a strong quarter, and that is really what's leading to the lift in the low end of that revenue assumption component and so we've talked to the strength in the first quarter. You're highlighting how we characterize the wide range of potential outcomes embedded within our outlook for the year. There's still certainly macro uncertainty in the back half of the year. That hasn't changed, but performance to date has been quite encouraging, which is leading to the increase in the outlook for the year.",
			"<strong>Michael Goldsmith</strong>",
			"Got it. And my follow-up question is about the strength in the sustainability of the L.A. market. Same-store NOI growth was up 20% in the quarter to added 300 basis points to the overall number. Presumably, this is reflecting the rate restrictions that were lifted in February of 2022, which you lapped during the quarter. But is there kind of like a second -- is there a second year of growth coming from the L.A. market? Or have we kind of used up all the gain there and the gain should be more modest going forward?",
			"<strong>Joseph D. Russell</strong>",
			"Yes, Michael. First of all, L.A. being our largest market, we've been very pleased by the performance we've been able to achieve over the last year or so. To your point, where the owners restrictions have been lifted, but it is also a market where we have a commanding presence. We've got very good inherent demand. We've got very good occupancies and very little new competitive product coming literally to any of the submarkets that we're competing in. So the inherent demand in the market is quite good. We think we've got against some good traction ahead of us, certainly going into the rest of 2023, and we'll continue to see where we go from there. <br/>But we've been very pleased by the performance of that portfolio. It is one of the markets that we -- to go back to my comment about Property Tomorrow, we put about $75 million in that portfolio to lift it from a brand awareness standpoint, finish that a little over 1.5 years ago. And again, good timing and tie to that -- being that much more prominent in the market. And one of the ways we measure the receptivity of that to is Net Promoter Scores. Again, getting very good reaction from customers and the brand itself is playing through quite well. So with that good demand and (inaudible) performance.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"We will take our next question from Smedes Rose with Citi.",
			"<strong>Smedes Rose</strong>",
			"You mentioned the almost 13% move-in volume across the first quarter, but move-out volume was lower, but kind of almost kept pace with the move-in volume. I was just wondering if you saw a similar trends in April as well?",
			"<strong>H. Thomas Boyle</strong>",
			"That's a great question, Smedes. So one of the things that took place during the quarter was we did gain occupancy, as you anticipate. And so occupancy from the end of the year through March was up 50 basis points. And in April, we gained another 20 basis points. So starting to see that seasonal uplift in occupancy that will really continue here into May. And I'd characterize the trajectories of year-over-year move-in and move-out growth as being favorable, i.e. as we move through the quarter, the move-out volume growth has modestly lowered and the move-in volume growth has modestly increased into April, i.e., so April was actually our best month in terms of gaining occupancy and closing the year-over-year occupancy gap on an incremental basis. So again, encouraging trends here as we head into the peak leasing season.",
			"<strong>Smedes Rose</strong>",
			"And then I just -- I noticed that the late charges, the pace of growth picked up at a faster pace than its rental income. I'm just wondering if there's anything kind of to read into that? And have you seen an uptick in kind of nonpayments or anything that would suggest some customers are under economic stress?",
			"<strong>H. Thomas Boyle</strong>",
			"Sure. Yes. There's 2 components to that line item. The one is what you're highlighting, which is that there are more customers that are making late payments this year than last year. But if you frame it over a multiyear time period, we're coming off of really, really low delinquency time periods over the last several years and remain well below 2019 levels of delinquency. But you're seeing an uptick there in late payments. And then I think, more interestingly, the fact that we had significant move-in volume growth also contributed there with our administrative fee that's charged on new customers when they move in, leading to a year-over-year increase in that line item as well.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"We will take our next question from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.",
			"<strong>Todd Michael Thomas</strong>",
			"First question, just related to investments, Tom. The balance sheet is in great shape. I think you commented that you're seeing an increase in inbound call volume from owners. Are you seeing the pipeline build? And can you speak a little bit to pricing, whether pricing seems to be moving in your favor such that we should expect to see deal flow pick up in the quarters ahead?",
			"<strong>H. Thomas Boyle</strong>",
			"Sure. So we have started to see or started to receive more inbounds more recently. And I do think that, that's healthy. And as you know, Todd, it's traditional to have a busier second half for storage transaction volumes in the first half, and we're encouraged to start to see that inbound activity. And we suspect it is going to lead to a pickup in volume as we move into the second half of this year. And in terms of the valuation as you think about the assets and where things have traded, transaction volumes have been relatively light to start the year. So I wouldn't point to a significant amount of data for us to sit here and say, that cap rates are at X or Y with significant precision. <br/>We're continuing to find good value in many of the assets and are closing that buyer and seller gap in many instances, but it remains wide in others. And so we're still working through that and anticipate to work through that through the rest of the year given what's played out with interest rates and the macro environment. To put some numbers on it, I think, on the last call, we said the cap rates have moved up about 100 to 125 basis points from the lows. And I would say we haven't seen anything over the last 3 months that would have us direct you any differently from that.",
			"<strong>Joseph D. Russell</strong>",
			"And then Todd, just a little bit more relative to the complexion of the activity so far. So Tom mentioned that we've been doing a number of deals off-market. So as always, we are looking for those kinds of opportunities as well. There are still owners out there that are looking for an efficient, clean transaction. The average occupancy of the $186 million that we've done so far has been about 50%. So thematically, very similar objective on our part where and if we can acquire properties that have upside once we put them in our platform, that's going to make sense relative to the ultimate yields that we're likely to achieve from those assets. So we're confident we're going to continue to see those kind of opportunities going into the rest of the year.",
			"<strong>Todd Michael Thomas</strong>",
			"Okay. And then how would you sort of compare and contrast the U.S. versus non-U.S. opportunity set today? And then also, would you -- just given the amount of development activity that's taken place over the last several years and some of the tighter lending environment that we're seeing today, would you consider building out a structured finance program at all to be a financing solution for borrowers, but also as a way to maybe expand the platform through third-party management and build a future investment pipeline?",
			"<strong>Joseph D. Russell</strong>",
			"Okay. So yes, a couple of questions or more on that statement. So first of all, from an international standpoint, I would say, consistent with what we've spoken to for some time, which is we're well equipped to consider and evaluate outside border opportunities. We continue to do that. Nothing to speak to as we are here today. But again, that's part of the overall mining that we're doing, both inside and outside borders. But we'll see how that plays out over time. <br/>Clearly, there's been far more in border opportunities over the last 3 or 4 years. And maybe to tie another part of your question is the fact that part of the reason for that is the amount of development that's come into the cycle has been done by owners that have no intention of being long-term holders of those assets. So that continues to be a good breeding ground for us to find deals. I'll let Tom talk about thoughts around going into any kind of lending platform, et cetera.",
			"<strong>H. Thomas Boyle</strong>",
			"Yes, I'd maybe take a step back and comment on your question around the lending environment. Because I do think stepping back, the lending environment has certainly gotten more challenged for many developers at this point and could lift it to lower new supply heading forward. And so we'll have to see how that plays out. In terms of our participation in other parts of the capital stack, we continue to find very good value in the equity portion of the capital stack and have been deploying capital there consistently over the last several years and found that to be a good risk-adjusted return. <br/>And I'd note, in addition to that, we have made some lending investments with some of our partners on a smaller scale. So it's something that we're considering as part of our wheelhouse as we move forward.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"We will take our next question from Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research.",
			"<strong>Keegan Grant Carl</strong>",
			"Maybe first here, just any more color on your development pipeline, particularly those assets that are completed from 2018 to 2020 seems as if occupancy levels are below your portfolio average by decent margin, but yes, they should have stabilized at this point based on your press release commentary. So just any sort of color on what's driving it, if it's maybe market-specific would be helpful.",
			"<strong>H. Thomas Boyle</strong>",
			"Yes, I'd characterize the performance of those assets to be pretty strong, right? I mean anything we delivered over that time period has benefited from really strong demand drivers. And frankly, they've been exceeding our expectations. Your comments around occupancies, I think some of those vintages are a touch under 90%, but they'll certainly stabilize above 90%. One of the things that I'd remind you is that occupancy is only one part of the equation of stabilization and rental rates is certainly the other, and we're seeking to maximize revenue from those pools of assets the same way we do our same-store pool. <br/>So occupancy will ultimately get over 90%. But I think more importantly, the rate growth there has been exceptionally strong and likely had several more years of strong rate growth compared to the same-store pool from that group of assets. And you can see the yields that we're achieving there, it continues to reinforce the strong risk-adjusted return of that program. And it leads to our increase in desire to continue to build moving forward. So the development pipeline now sitting over $1 billion as we seek to grow that program.",
			"<strong>Keegan Grant Carl</strong>",
			"That's helpful. And then one thing I noticed in the supplement, just your commentary on credit card fees stood out. Just kind of curious, is there a way for you guys to charge a higher rate on those using credit cards to offset that? Or do you just now want to take risk then bulking given those people in auto pay tend to be better customers?",
			"<strong>H. Thomas Boyle</strong>",
			"Yes, I'd say, for the most part, the increase in credit card fees related to the increase in revenue and by far and away is the contribution. So as revenues increase, you're going to see those payment processing fees go higher. From an operational standpoint, we do spend time thinking about ways to incentivize our customers to use attractive payment pattern for them, but also ones that may be cheaper for us to process. And so that's an ongoing kind of year in and year-out attempt through different operational methods. But to your point, we love to move people in and achieve that auto pay. And ultimately, it's much more important to achieve that move-in than it is to focus on the payments process.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) <br/>We will take our next question from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.",
			"<strong>Stephen Thomas Sakwa</strong>",
			"Great. I'm sure you guys are disappointed in the outcome with Life Storage, but does that sort of change kind of your view at all about kind of large-scale M&amp;A? Or do you feel like this kind of puts pressure for you to find other transactions of size to kind of keep your lead in the industry?",
			"<strong>Joseph D. Russell</strong>",
			"Yes, Steve. Clearly, we are well positioned to continue to grow in all different shapes and sizes. And we feel every bit, if not more, confident that opportunities will continue to arise going forward. So we're very focused on that. We are looking at many different alternatives going into future opportunity scenarios. But we feel that, again, the reset to whatever degree happens in the sector by virtue of the LSI and ESR combination. At the end of the day, it doesn't change the landscape from a competitive standpoint. <br/>One of the things that we've learned over time, scale's one part of efficiency and optimization, but many other things play through as well, that we continue to invest in that lead to our industry-leading margins, the things that we've done to enhance our own brand, the effectiveness of the presence we have market to market, and we feel very confident we're in good shape going forward, and we'll continue to make those investments.",
			"<strong>Stephen Thomas Sakwa</strong>",
			"Great. And then, I guess, secondly, on development, we continue to hear that development should be coming down given all the challenges in the lending environment. You guys have remained, I think, active. I'm just curious, are you sort of changing kind of how you guys underwrite development today? Have you changed your hurdles? Are you changing anything in the, I guess, the framework and the way you evaluate new development projects?",
			"<strong>Joseph D. Russell</strong>",
			"Yes. The -- first of all, development is a long game, right? So we're typically looking at scenarios that -- well without question, go in and out of all kinds of different ranges of economic cycles, et cetera, when you're thinking about total time periods to actually put a property to a point of not only opening, but stabilization, I mean you can easily be at a 5-year plus mark asset to asset. So that, I think, is a good headwind, particularly in this environment where, again, many owners are seeing different headwinds around cost of capital, availability of capital, component costs. <br/>I mentioned the amount of timing it takes to get approval city to city, and we've been talking about this for some time, it is far more difficult today than it's ever been on that front and literally almost everywhere. I can't even name a market where it's easier to develop today than it was 1, 2 or 3 years ago. So you've got to be, again, ready to work through those kinds of demands or those kinds of factors, those kinds of risk components. <br/>We feel very well suited to do that. In this environment, we're actually seeing the opportunity to pull more interesting properties into our own pipeline that potentially have far less competition from a land standpoint or even a repurposing standpoint. So the team is working hard, and we're finding some good opportunities. I'll let Tom talk a little bit about how our underwriting process play through as well. But that's something that always is reflective not only the current environment but the long-term environment.",
			"<strong>H. Thomas Boyle</strong>",
			"Yes. And just to piggyback on that, I think we're consistently looking to try to improve our underwriting processes year in and year out. And if you recall at Investor Day, our data science leader talked about some of the tools that, that team has helped develop with -- for use with our development and acquisition team. Those processes continue to be underway. We try to use our wealth of data internally to give us advantages on picking those sites and adding in new development. So underwriting process is consistently evolving in a positive way. In terms of hurdles and the like, obviously, we do with acquisitions as well as development and think about what our cost of capital is and evaluate that in the context of the returns that we expect on new capital allocation. But I'd point you to a relatively consistent trend, which we said that we're seeking to build new sites that will generate a yield on cost of circa 8% plus at delivery, and that's not significantly changed over the last several years.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"We will take our next question from Ki Bin Kim with Truist.",
			"<strong>Ki Bin Kim</strong>",
			"Did you guys provide an update on April moving rates? Sorry if I missed it.",
			"<strong>H. Thomas Boyle</strong>",
			"No, we didn't. The way I'd characterize move-in rents, and I think this is the first question on move-in rents on the call, which may be a record in terms of depth before we get that question, but move-in rates across the sector have been lower. And I think that's been pretty well documented. Move-in rents in the first half of the year, we anticipate to be down more significantly than maybe the back half of the year given the comp scenario that we've been discussing with the first half, really tough comps versus last year in the second half, easier comps. And so as we move into the second quarter, we anticipate move-in rents, and we're seeing that in April to be down in that kind of upper single digits to low double-digit types of comps.",
			"<strong>Ki Bin Kim</strong>",
			"Okay. Great. And how many stores do you have right now that are managed fully remotely without people? And are those -- any kind of shared characteristics are those usually just smaller stores in tertiary markets or in different places as well?",
			"<strong>Joseph D. Russell</strong>",
			"Yes, Ki Bin. I would tell you there's a broader context of the way we're approaching the whole concept of \"remote.\" One of the things I mentioned in my opening comments, is we've now got 400 properties on what we call customer-driven technological platforms, which includes a piece of what you might consider a property to be remotely managed. A misnomer on remote is remote also requires and every property still requires some level of on-site personnel. What we have done in a broader context is continue to test and now deploy pretty effective technological, predictive and data sources that we have to put people in the right places based on property activity, the amount of demand that's likely to come through the patterns both on a weekly, daily and monthly and even quarterly basis. <br/>So with that, we can really take even that baseline concept of remote to a far different level, which can work in suburban or remote areas. It can work in more dense areas. It can help us optimize the amount of necessary on-site labor. And this is all built around something that's first and foremost, which is actually maintaining or improving customer service. So there's a whole range of different components to that platform, some of which include kiosks, for instance, some of which include the way that we interact with customers through our customer care center. And then the other leg of that whole puzzle is a very effective time and presence from a face-to-face Public Storage employee. So all of those things are being optimized piece-by-piece, and we've done some very interesting things, and we have a lot more to come. Very excited about that part of the business.",
			"<strong>Ki Bin Kim</strong>",
			"And so you said 400 properties, you have about 2,900. I guess, what -- can you apply to all? And if you do, like does the FTE go from 2 to 1? Or -- I am just trying to understand the impact overall.",
			"<strong>Joseph D. Russell</strong>",
			"Yes. It's the roadmap we're on. I wouldn't say it's pure enough to say each and every one of the 2,900 properties have the same impact from the platform, but the great part about our overall strategy is there are components to this. So you can optimize FTE based on, again, what size of property you're dealing with, what historic level of either staffing or presence you'd have from an employee standpoint. And then Tom, you can talk a little bit about some of the economic benefits that we're likely to continue to see. But the great thing about this, it's -- like I said, far deeper than just remote because it can apply to many different types of assets, and we're excited about deploying in that many more parts of the business.",
			"<strong>H. Thomas Boyle</strong>",
			"Yes. The only thing I'd add to that, Ki Bin, is in our Investor Day presentation, we did highlight our objective to reduce labor hours and get more efficient with labor hours through the specialization and centralization that Joe is speaking to in reacting to customer demand. And the target we set is for a reduction in labor hours of 25%. We'll achieve that this year. In fact, we think that there is more upside from here. So just another component of how we're seeking to get more efficient and drive our industry-leading margins higher.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"We will take our next question from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.",
			"<strong>Michael William Mueller</strong>",
			"I was wondering, are you seeing any signs of like the degradation of length of stay for your lower-term customers that have been there over a year or 2?",
			"<strong>H. Thomas Boyle</strong>",
			"Yes. I mean, we characterize the length of stay is sitting at records in our prepared remarks earlier. And so generally speaking, while we have seen move-outs increase in trend back towards 2019 levels, the length of stay of the overall platform continues to be really strong. The portfolio now -- the average length of stay of the tenant base today is over 36 months and has been sitting around that sort of ZIP code for the last several quarters. In terms of the longer length of stay, customers themselves and how they're behaving, they continue to behave quite well. And on a year-over-year basis, the percentage of customers greater than 2 years is actually higher than where it was last year. So continuing to demonstrate the strength of that component of tenant base.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"We will take our next question from Spenser Allaway with Green Street.",
			"<strong>Spenser Bowes Allaway</strong>",
			"Maybe just another one similar to the development topic. But can you just remind us what percent of the portfolio would you say has true expansion opportunity?",
			"<strong>Joseph D. Russell</strong>",
			"Yes, Spenser, I don't think we've ever characterized that as a specific number. What leads to those kinds of expansion opportunities are several factors. We have hundreds of properties that have been developed, say, 30, 40 or 50 years ago that in those periods of time, a traditional property you might have a much larger amount of acreage and would typically have, what we would call our Gen 1 product simple, single-story drive-up product. There are many opportunities within the portfolio to potentially acquire different and higher levels of FAR to magnify the size of those properties. <br/>And frankly, many of them are in great locations, some of which we get far better customer demand once we actually even make the property that much bigger. So there's a sizable set of those types of assets. Time and the effort that goes into that to be quite complex. Many cities won't allow us to do certain expansions of that magnitude. Some that may open the door to that, actually, they will put you through a multiyear process. That, again, you've got to work through very diligently. <br/>So we've got a number of those efforts in play as we speak. Another thing that we have at hand in many assets, for instance, is either some additional excess land or parking area that, too, can be developed or expanded into, again, a more modern facility as an extension of what's already on the property. So there's a whole range of things that we're continuing to evaluate on that front, but the good news is by virtue of our very consistent investment processes now for several decades. We've got amazing sites. And with that, in many areas, properties that have far different demand and better demand dynamics when they're originally built that could fit very well to, again, the opportunity going forward. <br/>Today, the $1 billion development pipeline, plus or minus about 50% of that is actually tied to the kinds of sites I'm speaking to. And the team is going to continue to work, to monetize and unlock those opportunities as we go forward. One of the great things about our development team is they can wear both hats. They can work on ground-up development as well as expansion development. We're doing that like-for-like, clearly in many of the markets that we're looking for expansion.",
			"<strong>Spenser Bowes Allaway</strong>",
			"Okay. That was really helpful color. And I was also just wondering, just given the fact that there has been a lack of larger portfolios in the market, has there been any increase to the personnel dedicated to sourcing or underwriting acquisitions just as I would imagine, the deals are a little bit more granular than normal. But it sounds like from what you just said, your personnel are very dynamic and perhaps can wear multiple hats.",
			"<strong>Joseph D. Russell</strong>",
			"Yes. To that point, maybe just to give you a little context. 2021, to your point, it was an unusual year where we did a couple of very large unusual transactions. And again, the flip side of that, though, is that was only half of our volume of the $5.1 billion that we did. The other half was dedicated to what's very traditional, either single-asset acquisitions or much smaller portfolios. We've got a deep-seated team, very knowledgeable, very well placed relative to knowledge of markets, knowledge of owners and the kind of dialogue that comes with that from a relationship standpoint, has been and will continue to be very important for our efforts to grow the portfolio. <br/>As Tom mentioned, about half or more than half alliance share -- the acquisition volume that we've done in 2023 has come from off-market transactions. So part of that is just, again, as I think you're alluding to, we've got the right team in place to go out and engage. We've got a great reputation as a preferred buyer, and we're going to continue to leverage that.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"It appears we have no further questions on the line at this time. I will turn the program back over to Ryan Burke for any additional or closing remarks.",

			"For instance, shares trade at roughly 15 times this year’s earnings estimates, while analysts expect mid-single-digit earnings and revenue growth. That’s a rather low valuation and even if the growth rate isn’t robust, growth is growth and in a tough environment, that’s all we can ask for.",

			"Think about it. PepsiCo not only dominates the beverage space with brands like Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Tropicana, OceanSpray, and others, but it also dominates snack brands too, owning Tostitos, Ruffles, Rold Gold, Lay’s, Cheetos, Doritos and <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:plenty of others;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.pepsico.com/our-brands/creating-smiles/our-products\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">plenty of others</a>. Put simply, PepsiCo dominates the food and beverages aisles at the grocery store.

Ultimately I went with the latter, but there is a pretty big caveat to mention.",
			"This is not a stock for short-term investors. Further, Realty Income — or O stock for short — is one of the few stocks out there that hasn’t gone on to make new highs since the Covid-19 selloff. Conversely, P&amp;G has roared to 52-week highs in recent trading. Despite the rally, P&amp;G trades at roughly 26 times earnings with a nearly non-existent growth forecast for this year. That’s okay for some investors, as P&amp;G is a dividend stud. However, Realty Income shouldn’t be ignored either.",
			"Although there is the commercial real estate risk that could weigh on REITs — that being the “caveat” I mentioned a moment ago — Realty Income is really impressive when it comes to long-term investors buying, holding, and dripping the dividend. Shares yield just over 5%, the highest on this list, while the company pays its dividend monthly, not quarterly. Lastly, it has <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:raised;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.realtyincome.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">raised</a> its dividend in 102 consecutive quarters (or more than 25 years) and has paid its monthly dividend consecutively for more than 52 years!",

			"\"With the peak leasing season now underway, multifamily conditions started to show signs of stabilization,\" said <b>Jay Lybik, National Director of Multifamily Analytics at CoStar Group</b>. \"National year-over-year asking rent growth slowed to 2.1% at the end of April from 2.6% at the end of March, vacancy rates held steady and 34,000 units were absorbed, signaling a strong start to the second quarter.\"",
			"<b>YEAR-OVER-YEAR RENT GROWTH SNAPSHOT, INDIANAPOLIS HOLDS STEADY WITH TOP SPOT</b>",
			"In April 2023, national average rents rose from $1,650 to $1,656 or by 0.4%. Indianapolis had the highest year-over-year rent growth at 6.1%, sitting just ahead of other Midwest markets like Cincinnati, St. Louis and Columbus. The Midwest region held six of the top 10 rent growth positions during the month of April.",
			"Despite continued activity in the Midwest, year-over-year rent growth has slowed in many markets as demand for multifamily has weakened. Fast-growing Sun Belt markets, such as Las Vegas, Austin and Phoenix, that experienced significant in-migration during the pandemic are now seeing rents fall over the year.",
			"<b>MONTH-OVER-MONTH SHOWS POTENTIAL FOR STABILIZATION</b>",
			"Month-over-month data suggests the beginning of possible stabilization across the multifamily sector, with positive rent growth in 38 of the top 40 markets. Notably, Nashville and Raleigh saw month-over-month rent growth accelerate as a result of slight improvements in April vacancy rates.",
			"<b>LOOKING AHEAD</b>",
			"April’s multifamily findings boost the likelihood that the sector’s fundamentals will stop weakening and the second quarter will finish stronger than a year ago, setting up the potential for the quarter overall to outperform expectations. However, there are a few potential risks to be mindful of, including the economy falling into a recession in the second half of 2023, demand drying up and the significant number of deliveries expected throughout the year.",

Furthermore, it revised its 2023 outlook.<br/><br/>Quarterly revenues of $1.09 billion outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.29%. It also beat our estimate of $1.08 billion.

However, the weighted-average square foot occupancy of 93.2% was down 2.4% year over year.<br/><br/>Cost of operations for the same store facilities increased 5.6% year over year, mainly due to a rise in property tax expense, repairs and maintenance expenses, marketing expenses and other direct property costs.",
			"Consequently, PSA’s same-store net operating income (NOI) increased 11.2% to $641.5 million.

			"SBA Communications Corporation misses on earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.93 EPS, expectations were $1.21.",
			"<strong>Operator:</strong> Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the SBA, First Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode and later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mark DeRussy, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.",
			"<strong>Mark DeRussy:</strong> Good evening and thank you for joining us for SBA’s first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Jeff Stoops, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Brendan Cavanagh, our Chief Financial Officer. Some of the information we will discuss on this call is forward-looking, including but not limited to any guidance for 2023 and beyond. In today’s press release and in our SEC filings, we detail material risks that may cause our future results to differ from our expectations. Our statements are as of today, May 1 and we have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements that we may make. In addition, our comments will include non-GAAP financial measures and other key operating metrics.",
			"The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will now turn the call over to Brendan to discuss our first quarter results.",
			"<strong>Brendan Cavanagh:</strong> Thank you, Mark. Good evening. We started the year off with a solid first quarter. Our results were slightly ahead of our expectation and allowed us to increase our full-year 2023 outlook for most metrics. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the first quarter were $617.3 million and cash site leasing revenues were $610.4 million. Foreign exchange rates represented a benefit of approximately $600,000 when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter and a headwind of $2.5 million when compared to the first quarter of 2022. Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the first quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4.7% net over the first quarter of 2022, including the impact of 4.2% of churn.",
			"On a gross basis, same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth was 8.9%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the first quarter of last year was 8.5% on a gross basis and 5.1% on a net basis, including 3.4% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the first quarter remains steady and was similar through the fourth quarter. We again saw balanced contributions from each of our largest customers. During the first quarter, amendment activity represented 51% of our domestic bookings and new leases represented 49%. The big four carriers of AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented approximately 95% of total incremental domestic leasing revenues signed up during the quarter.",
			"Domestically, churn was in-line with our prior quarter projections, and our full-year churn expectations remain the same as we provided last quarter, including $25 million to $30 million of Sprint merger-related churn. Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 2.5% net, including 7.8% of churn or 10.3% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was good again, with similar results to our solid fourth quarter. Inflation-based escalators also continue to make healthy contributions to our organic growth, although these inflationary rates have begun to decline from their ‘22 highs. In Brazil, our largest international market, we had another good quarter, although the impact of the previously discussed TIM agreement weighed on our first quarter, same-tower organic growth.",
			"This growth rate in Brazil was 4.7% on a constant currency basis, including the impact of 5.9% of churn. International churn remains elevated, but in line with expectations and our previously provided outlook. Excluding Oi consolidation related churn, we believe 2023 will be the high watermark for international churn. As a reminder, our 2023 outlook does not include any churn assumptions related to the Oi consolidation, other than associated with the TIM agreement, but if during the year we were to enter into any further agreements with other carriers related to the Oi consolidation that have an impact on the current year, we would adjust our outlook accordingly at that time. During the first quarter, 78% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars.",
			"The majority of non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 15.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter, and 12.4% of cash site leasing revenue excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. Tower cash flow for the first quarter was $491 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong as well, with a first quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 84.3% and an international tower cash flow margin of 69.9% or 91.8%, excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $459.3 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 68.7% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 74%. Approximately 97% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the first quarter.",
			"During the first quarter, our services business had another strong quarter, with $58.2 million in revenue and $14.1 million of segment operating profit. Our carrier customers remained busy deploying new 5G related equipment during the quarter, and our services backlogs also remained healthy at quarter end. Adjusted Funds From Operations or AFFO in the first quarter was $341.7 million. AFFO per share was $3.13, an increase of 5.7% over the first quarter of 2022. AFFO growth was hindered by increased interest rates, which are anticipated to impact growth rates throughout the year. During the first quarter, we continue to invest in our portfolio, acquiring 14 communication sites for total cash consideration of $8.6 million. During the quarter we also built 52 new sites.",

			"Subsequent to quarter end we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 66 sites, all in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $63.7 million. We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the year. In addition to new towers, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $11.6 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 70% of our towers, and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years. With that, I’ll now turn things over to Mark who will provide an update on our balance sheet.",
			"<strong>Mark DeRussy:</strong> Thanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter of $12.9 billion total debt and $12.7 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.9x, below the low end of our target range. Our first quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense remains at a strong 4.7x. During and subsequent to quarter end, we borrowed and repaid certain amounts under our revolving credit facility. And as of today, we have a $595 million outstanding balance under our $1.5 billion revolver. The current weighted average interest rate of our total outstanding debt is 3.1% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 3.8 years. The current rate on our outstanding revolver balance is 6.5%.",
			"The interest rate on 93% of our current outstanding debt is fixed. During the quarter we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock and we currently have $505 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company shares outstanding at March 31, 2023 were $108.3 million. In addition, during the quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $93.9 million or $0.85 per share. And today we announced that our Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $0.85 per share, payable on June 21, 2023 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 26, 2023. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 20% over the dividend paid in the year ago period and only represents 27% of our projected full year AFFO.",
			"With that, I will now turn the call over to Jeff.",
			"<strong>Jeff Stoops:</strong> Thanks Mark and good evening everyone. The first quarter represented a very good start to 2023. Our team continued to execute at a very high level and we produced solid year-over-year growth in each of our key metrics. Each of our largest U.S. customers remain busy and they contributed relatively equally to our organic leasing activity during the quarter. The focus of their activity was a balanced mix of adding equipment to sites in support of 5G through the deployment of new spectrum bands and infill and coverage expansion through brand new colocations. While we believe domestic activity in 2023 will fall below the peak levels of activity in 2022, we expect our carrier customers to stay relatively busy with additional network deployment over the next several years for a number of reasons.",
			"Some of AT&amp;T's and Verizon’s C-Band licenses will not be cleared until later this year. The C-Band and 3.45 gigahertz licenses won by T-Mobile have been delayed due to the lapse of the FCC spectrum authority. Dual band radios are our customers are planning to use in their deployment supporting 3.45 gigahertz and C-Band frequencies have just been approved by the FCC and dual band radios supporting C-Band and CBRS are still pending approval. And DISH will be moving forward with additional co-locations to meet their 2025 coverage requirements. We believe all of these developments will drive multi-year continued development activity. Also encouraging about the prospects for future network development activity is the letter sent last week from CTIA to the White House, imploring the President to free up 1,500 megahertz of additional mid-band spectrum currently held by the Department of Defense and other governmental agencies.",
			"The request is for the spectrum to be made available on a full-power license basis, which obviously would have positive implications for additional macro-site activity. The request from CTIA demonstrates the industry believes that more network resources will be necessary to handle increasing demand for volume, quality and new applications and to stay competitive with the rest of the world. Just as the last 20 years has demonstrated the need for continuous network investment, we believe the future will be the same. We believe this will provide continued – a continued positive environment for SBA. Internationally we also add a solid quarter with continued steady organic leasing activity. During the first quarter, 42% of new international business signed up in the quarter came from amendments to existing leases and 58% came through new leases with particularly strong contributions from Tanzania and South Africa.",
			"Brazil also had a strong quarter, ahead of our internal expectations with contributions from each of the big three carriers in that market, as well as good-sized contributions from CPI based escalators. The integration of the GTS assets has gone very smoothly and these assets are performing well thus far, and we have seen a stabilization in the currency exchange rate that has contributed to our increased full-year outlook. We remain excited about our opportunities in Brazil over the coming years as we build on our strong customer relationships and expect meaningful 5G related investments and continued expansion of wireless services throughout the country. Moving on now to our balance sheet, we remain in a very strong position. As we have stated before, we continue to be a preferred issuer in the debt markets we currently participate in with extremely good access to capital.",
			"With respect to the current interest rate environment, fortunately we do not have any debt materials until October 2024. Thus we do not need to issue incremental debt today, unless we see a compelling use of capital that we expect to be additive to long-term shareholder value. We finished the quarter with 93% of our debt fixed and thus we are only modestly exposed to significant interest rate fluctuations. Our exposure to floating rate debt is also expected to decline further as we anticipate further paying down our outstanding revolver balance throughout the year absent other more compelling capital allocation. While our first choice for capital allocation continues to be portfolio growth, today the market is pretty slow globally and lacking attractive opportunities.",
			"That of course can change quickly and we will be ready when it does. We ended the quarter with a net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 6.9x below our target range and giving us flexibility if we see value enhancing investment opportunities. As a result of our strong financial position and our optimism about our future, today we announced our second quarter dividend, consistently our first quarter dividend which represents a nearly 20% year-over-year increase. This dividend represents only approximately 27% of our projected AFFO in our 2023 outlook, leaving us substantial capital for additional investment in portfolio growth, stocking purchases and revolver payments. Our financial condition remains very strong. Last quarter I mentioned the fourth quarter ratings upgrade we received from Standard &amp; Poor’s to just below investment grade.",
			"Since our last earnings release, we received another ratings increase, this time from Moody's. These upgrades are indicative of the comfort the rating agencies have and the strength and stability of our underlying business. The future of our business remains bright. Our customers continue to have significant network needs and we are committed to supporting them and efficiently and effectively meeting those needs. I want to thank our customers and I want to thank our team members for the significant effort put in by all to the contribution to our shared success. We look forward to sharing with you our progress as we move throughout the balance of 2023. And with that Eric, we are now ready for questions.",

			"<strong>Charles J. Meyers</strong>",
			"Thank you, Chip. Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. <br/>We had a strong start to the year, delivering quarterly revenues right at $2 billion, with adjusted EBITDA and AFFO above the top end of our expectations. Despite a challenging macro environment, customers remain committed to their digital transformation journeys, driving 4,000 deals in the quarter across more than 3,000 customers, highlighting the scale and diversity of our go-to-market engine and the broad-based demand that continues to propel the business. We continue to see enterprises and service providers build out their IT infrastructure on Platform Equinix. And that infrastructure is more distributed, more cloud connected and more hybrid than ever before. <br/>And while some customers are appropriately cautious about the timing of their investments given macro conditions, Equinix continues to be a critical partner in their efforts to advance hybrid architectures, unlock digital performance gains and optimize cloud and network spend. As a result, our deal win rates remain steady compared to historical trends, and we continue to see a robust pricing environment across all 3 regions. <br/>Turning to power. We're very pleased with how the organization has navigated a volatile energy market and we remain in a strong position, significantly mitigating the impacts of this volatility for our business and for our customers. As previously discussed, we raised pricing in January to more than 7,000 customers across 16 countries, generating approximately $90 million of incremental revenue in the quarter, fully offsetting the impact of higher power costs. Thanks to timely and transparent communications, concessions and disputes are low and our days of sales outstanding remain in line with historical trends. <br/>On the sustainability front, we are committed to responsible growth and continue to advance our bold future first sustainability agenda. Sustainability is increasingly becoming a board-level issue, and Gartner estimates that by 2026, 75% of organizations will seek to increase business with IT vendors that have demonstrable sustainability goals and timelines, and we'll seek to replace those who don't. <br/>We recently published our eighth annual CSR report. And in 2022, we extended our industry leadership with 96% renewable energy coverage, making our fifth consecutive year with over 90% coverage. We're also progressing well on our science-based targets, with a 23% reduction in operational emissions across Scope 1 and Scope 2 from our 2019 baseline. <br/>Additionally, Equinix continues to evolve its power procurement portfolio to increase the quality of its renewable energy purchases. This year, we signed new long-term power purchase agreements for solar projects in Spain totaling 345 megawatts of capacity, bringing Equinix's contracted renewable energy PPA portfolio to 715 megawatts globally once fully operational. <br/>Looking forward, where feasible, we'll continue to prioritize projects that create new sources of clean energy directly in the grids where we operate and support a healthy renewable energy coverage mix. <br/>Turning to our results. As depicted on Slide 3, revenues for Q1 were $2 billion, up 16% year-over-year, driven by strong recurring revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA was up 18% year-over-year, and AFFO was better than our expectations due to strong operating performance. These growth rates are all on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our unmatched scale and reach continues to differentiate our data center services portfolio, and the tremendous strength of our balance sheet positions us to sustain our investment in new capacity to support a robust demand environment. We currently have 50 major projects underway across 37 metros in 25 countries, including 10x scale projects that will deliver more than 90 megawatts of capacity once opened. <br/>This quarter, we added new data center builds in Lagos, Frankfurt and Rio de Janeiro. Revenues from multi-region and 3 region customers increased 1% quarter-over-quarter to an impressive 76% and 65%, respectively. Key multi-region wins in the quarter included a Fortune 500 manufacturing conglomerate, expanding its Performance Hub deployments across all 3 regions to assist with business unit divestiture; and a cloud-native zero trust cybersecurity company using Equinix Metal to expand its business across all 3 regions. Our platform remains the logical point of nexus for hybrid and multi-cloud deployments, and hyperscalers continue to look to Equinix as a critical infrastructure provider and a valued go-to-market partner. <br/>This quarter, we won 5 new cloud on-ramps across Melbourne, Mumbai, Muscat, Tokyo and Warsaw as we continue to enjoy a strong leadership position in multi-cloud connectivity compared to our closest competitors. We're also seeing the unique breadth of our product portfolio across retail colo, interconnection services, ex scale and digital services resonate strongly with customers as they embrace rapidly emerging opportunities in AI. We've closed several key AI wins over the past few quarters and are seeing a growing pipeline of new opportunities directly and with key partners for both training and inference use cases that benefit from the unique performance characteristics and multi-cloud proximity of our platform. <br/>In our xScale portfolio, we continue to see strong overall demand. In Q1, we pre-leased our entire Frankfurt 16 asset, representing 14 megawatts of capacity, taking us to over 75% leased or pre-leased across our nearly 260 megawatts of operational and announced xScale facilities. And we have a strong funnel of additional xScale opportunities in the coming quarters. Enterprise to cloud wins this quarter included a leading consumer products company, leveraging Equinix's robust ecosystems for their private multi-cloud connectivity needs; and the Hearst Corporation, a diversified media company deploying on Platform Equinix to execute its cloud-first strategy, including the deployment of Network Edge for their network aggregation. <br/>Turning to our industry-leading interconnection business. We now have over 452,000 total interconnections on our platform. In Q1, interconnection revenue stepped up 12% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis, and we added an incremental 5,300 interconnections for the quarter. We saw some continued grooming activity and consolidation into higher bandwidth VCs on Fabric, but both moderated from the prior quarter. While gross adds remain strong, pricing is firm and the diversity of our customer interconnection continues to expand. As global data volumes continue to accelerate, Internet Exchange saw peak traffic up 3% quarter-over-quarter and 26% year-over-year to greater than 30 terabits per second for the first time.<br/>And as enterprises continue to embrace hybrid and multi-cloud as their architecture of choice, they are increasingly seeking the security, performance and convenience of Equinix Fabric to connect to their choice of cloud and IT services across the broader digital ecosystem. One example is Cisco, whose multiple edge-delivered services now rank among the leading end destinations on Fabric. Customer wins included Caixa, Brazil's federal financial services company, partnering with Equinix to accelerate its business by optimizing and securing its network core via Fabric.<br/>We also continue to enhance our platform with our digital services portfolio and saw strong new user growth for our Equinix Metal offering as we cultivate product-like growth. Wins this quarter included a Japanese video game company utilizing Equinix Metal in all 3 regions to support a new product launch; and Restack, an Australian SaaS integrator and managed services provider, utilizing Equinix Fabric and our edge services to optimize their solution offerings.<br/>Our channel program delivered another strong quarter, accounting for roughly 35% of bookings and 60% of new logos. Wins were across a wide range of industry verticals and digital first use cases with strong engagement across the hyperscalers and continued momentum with partners like AT&amp;T, Dell, Cisco, HPE, Orange Business and Zenlayer. Key wins included a digital modernization win with Entel, our largest local partner in Chile. On behalf of Empresa Nacional del Petroleo, a Chilean oil and gas company, Entel is delivering a fully managed SD-WAN solution based upon Cisco technology while leveraging Equinix data center and interconnection services, demonstrating how local partners can help deliver value to clients in new Equinix markets. <br/>Now let me turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter.",
			"<strong>Keith D. Taylor</strong>",
			"Thanks, Charles, and good afternoon to everyone. <br/>As highlighted by Charles, we had an outstanding start to the year. As you can see from our financial results, the team delivered on multiple fronts in the quarter with record net bookings, including power price increases. Excluding those power price increases, our net bookings performance was solid, the result of again, net positive pricing actions across each of our regions and lower MRR churn. Global MRR per cabinet yield increased by $124 per cabinet on an as-reported basis or about $27 per cabinet adjusting for prior price increases and other one-offs. And as we highlighted on the last earnings call, we completed our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet, raising both debt and equity in the quarter and remaining well-funded to meet our future growth expectations. <br/>Now as you would expect, despite the continued strength of our business, we remain highly focused on the broader market dynamics. But as we've stated before, during periods of disruption, Equinix thrives, given our high-quality and diverse set of customers, who view Equinix as a mission-critical partner to place their ecosystem-driven digital infrastructure, whether it be a cloud on-ramp, a networking node, a cable landing station or a trading platform. As you'll remember, 90% of our quarterly bookings come from those existing customers as they expand their current environment or maybe move to more markets or simply buy more services. <br/>Finally, our strong liquidity position, low dividend to AFFO payout ratio and reduced debt leverage allows us to continue to invest to extend our product portfolio and expand our global footprint, in both cases driving top line growth. Simply put, we're in a strong, fully-funded financial position, allowing us to meet all of our capital needs while maintaining the strategic and operational flexibility we need to grow and scale the business. <br/>Now let me cover the highlights from the quarter. Note that all comments in this section are on a normalized and constant currency basis. <br/>As depicted on Slide 4, our global Q1 revenues were $1.998 billion, up 16% over the same quarter last year and above the top end of our guidance range due to strong recurring revenues and the timing of xScale nonrecurring fees. As we've noted before, nonrecurring revenues, particularly those revenues attributed to our xScale business and custom installation works, are inherently lumpy. And given the momentum we're seeing in our xScale business across all 3 regions, nonrecurring revenues could fluctuate meaningfully over the next 3 quarters of the year. Q1 revenues, net of our FX hedges, included a $2 million tailwind when compared to our prior guidance rates due to a weaker U.S. dollar in the quarter. Global Q1 adjusted EBITDA was $944 million or 47% of our revenues, up 18% over the same quarter last year, and again above the top end of our guidance range due to strong operating performance, including flat quarter-over-quarter SG&amp;A spend. <br/>As expected, Q1 adjusted EBITDA benefited from lower seasonal power consumption and favorable energy hedge rates, which will reset higher starting in Q2 as anticipated, resulting in increased net utility spend over the next 3 quarters of the year. Q1 adjusted EBITDA, net of our FX hedges, included a $2 million FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance range and $5 million of integration costs. <br/>Global Q1 AFFO was $802 million, above our expectations due to strong business performance, including lower net interest expense and income taxes. As expected, we had seasonally lower recurring CapEx spend, consistent with prior years. Q1 FFO included a $2 million FX benefit when compared to our prior guidance rates. Global Q1 MRR churn was 2%, a continued reflection of our disciplined sales strategy. For the full year, we expect MRR churn to average at the low end of 2% to 2.5% of our quarterly range. <br/>Turning to our regional highlights, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 through 7. On a year-over-year normalized basis, EMEA was our fastest-growing region at 28% due to our significant power increases. Excluding the benefit attributed to those price increases, EMEA growth was 14%. Our APAC and Americas region growth rates were 15% and 9%, respectively. The Americas region had another solid quarter, with strong performance from our public sector team and continued favorable pricing trends. We saw strong momentum in our Chicago, Culpeper, Seattle metros and a Brazilian business. Our EMEA business delivered a great quarter, successfully executing on our price increase program while also seeing lower-than-expected MRR churn. <br/>In the quarter, we saw bookings strength in our Amsterdam, Dublin and Manchester metros. And finally, the Asia Pacific region had a solid quarter led by our Mumbai, Tokyo and Singapore markets, with strong new logo additions and firm pricing. Now while Singapore remains capacity constrained as part of our IBX optimization efforts, we continue to proactively negotiate with certain customers with larger deployments to recover capacity which we anticipate to be backfilled at much higher rates, although it could affect our in-quarter MRR churn and net cabinets billing metric. <br/>And now looking at the capital structure, please refer to Slide 8. Our balance sheet increased to approximately $31.3 billion, including an unrestricted cash balance of $2.6 billion. Our cash balance increased quarter-over-quarter due to strong operating cash flow while we also raised approximately $580 million of yen-denominated debt and closed at the prior year's forward sales from our ATM program. Our net leverage remains low at 3.4x our adjusted EBITDA, with 96% of our outstanding debt being fixed with no near-term maturities. <br/>Given the global nature of our business, we continue to look to raise additional debt capital in reduced rate countries where we intend to expand, creating both incremental debt capital to fund our growth and placing natural hedges into these markets. <br/>Turning to Slide 9. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $530 million, including seasonally lower recurring CapEx of $22 million. Since our last earnings call, we opened 4 retail projects in Frankfurt, Paris, Singapore and Sydney. We also purchased land for development in Calgary and Madrid. Revenues from owned assets were 63% of our recurring revenues for the quarter. <br/>Our capital investments delivered strong returns, as shown on Slide 10. Our now 171 stabilized assets increased revenues by 11% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Taking out the benefit attributed to power price increases, stabilized assets increased 7% year-over-year. Consistent with prior years, in Q1, we completed the annual refresh of our IBX categorization exercise. Our stabilized asset count increased by a net 13 IBXs. Now stabilized assets are collectively 85% utilized and generate a 27% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&amp;E invested. <br/>And finally, please refer to Slides 11 through 15 for our updated summary of 2023 guidance and bridges. Do note, all growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis. For the full year, we're raising our revenue guidance by $30 million and adjusted EBITDA guidance by $20 million, primarily due to favorable FX rates and lower integration costs. This guidance implies a revenue growth rate of 14% to 15%, inclusive of power price increases, or 9% to 10%, excluding the power cost pass-through, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 45%, excluding integration costs. We now expect to incur $33 million of integration costs in 2023. And we're raising 2023 AFFO guidance by $44 million to now grow between 10% and 13% compared to the previous year, and AFFO per share is now expected to grow 8% to 11%. 2023 CapEx is expected to range between $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion, including approximately $150 million of on-balance sheet xScale spend, which we expect to be reimbursed as we transfer assets into the JVs, about $205 million of recurring CapEx spend. <br/>So let me stop here. I'm going to turn the call back to Charles.",
			"<strong>Charles J. Meyers</strong>",
			"Thanks, Keith. In closing, we had a solid start to the year. While we remain vigilant to the challenges in the broader macro economy, our Q1 results were strong and our outlook remains positive, with the overall demand for digital transformation fueling our conviction around the long-term secular drivers of our business. We look forward to our upcoming Analyst Day in June, where we will further outline the significant opportunity ahead and discuss our strongly differentiated position in capturing this opportunity as we enable our customers to access all the right places, partners and possibilities. We also look forward to diving more deeply into our evolving platform capabilities, our industry-leading go-to-market engine, and sharing expectations of how all of this will translate into durable and differentiated value creation for our investors, our customers and the communities in which we operate. So let me stop there and open it up for questions.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) Our first caller is Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank.",
			"<strong>Matthew Niknam</strong>",
			"Just two quick ones, if I could. First, on bookings trends. Can you comment at all in terms of linearity and whether you saw any potential slowdown going to some of the macro choppiness that really picked up in March? We've heard maybe a similar theme from some others across tech. And then just the second one, on cap allocation, specifically just related to potential inorganic opportunities. Just wondering what you're seeing in terms of opportunities, both domestically and abroad, whether seller expectations have become more reasonable just in the context of leverage now sitting just shy of 3.5 turns.",
			"<strong>Charles J. Meyers</strong>",
			"Thanks, Matt. Yes. Look, I think overall, as we said in the script, I think we continue to feel good about the demand level. I think definitely, customers are feeling tighter budgets, looking to stretch their dollars. But I think their commitment to digital is strong, and I think how they're using us in terms of looking to capture savings in a variety of areas. And again, long-term digital transformation equipments are driving pretty solid activity levels. <br/>So I think the overall, we did about 4,000 deals in the quarter of 3,000 customers, very much in line with kind of what we've done in prior quarters. Linearity was pretty good. And so we probably saw a few more deals slip into the following quarter than we would have in previous quarters. And then on sales cycle, just to give you more of a concrete data point to hang your hat on, we usually see about 45% -- I'm sorry, about 40% of our deals extend beyond the 90-day sales cycle. And that rose in this last quarter to about 45%. So a little bit of an increase, but not particularly material. And as we saw a little bit of slippage, actually our linearity in Q2 is already looking pretty good. So we started with a little bit richer funnel and so we're off to a good start in Q2.<br/>So again, I think that clearly, you're feeling a little bit of caution in the macro market, but overall, I think in terms of what people are -- how they're thinking about digital, how they're thinking about Equinix in that context, we continue to see a pretty good overall environment. <br/>Relative to your second question on capital allocation, look, our balance sheet, thanks to our team's efforts, is in a really good place. And as I've said in a number of settings, I do think there's going to be opportunities for us, both organically and inorganic. I don't think we're -- we're starting to see, I think, some softening in multiples. And I think that's likely to continue depending on kind of overall sort of recessionary sort of dynamics and that kind of thing. And so we'll keep an eye on that. I do think as a market leader, and we've got a long track record of being able to unlock value from M&amp;A, and we're definitely positioned to do that if the right things come along. And so I do think that we probably expect some capital allocation towards that. And I think our balance sheet puts us in a really good position. <br/>Keith, anything to add there?",

			"Yes, Matt, if I can just maybe add a couple of quick points to what Charles said. The other part about the leverage being a little bit lower than we typically run at, part just because of the money that we raised and the opportunity we sort of went for us to go into the market and draw on some -- particularly on the debt capital in Japan, that put more cash on our balance sheet. And so that cash is going to get consumed, but one of the things I wanted certainly you and the rest of the listeners to walk away with is that we do have the cash. We have the flexibility, both operationally and structurally, but we're going to consume the cash.<br/>And in many ways, we're paying today for, one, we're fully funded for all that we see, but you look forward in time and say, well, what are we going to do in '24 and what are we going to do in '25? And so you're already -- we're already thinking ahead and hence my comments that we want to continue to raise capital because we know our dividend, our dividend is going to grow. We know we're going to continue to spend capital and the like. And we want to have that flexibility that Charles sort of alludes to, when things shake themselves free, if it makes sense for us, then we would certainly strike, and we need a good strong balance sheet. <br/>All that said, at the end of the day, we're going to consume the cash, we're going to consume it into our growth cycles. And our leverage is actually going to go up because we're measuring it on a net debt basis. And again, I just think we all like the flexibility and the liquidity we have as a company, and we can use that to our fullest advantage going forward.",

			"Got a couple of questions. One on Slide 10, where you have the stabilized growth, 11% top line, I think that's a record. And I just wanted to get a sense as to what was driving that. And then another metrics question, just the Americas cabinet equivalents actually was down sequentially and MRR [gift to bid] in APAC and in EMEA, the cabinets billing number didn't grow at all. The footnote referenced timing of installs and churn, and I wonder if you can kind of drill down on that a bit.",
			"<strong>Charles J. Meyers</strong>",
			"Yes. Great question, Jon. So on stabilized growth, obviously, incredible results fueled, obviously, in part by PPI, on power price increase. So 11% is definitely really high. If you take out the effects of power price increase, that still takes you down to about 7%, so really attractive. And if you take out the new stabilized assets, which are obviously less mature and probably growing faster than others, take -- would take it down to about 5% from the previous sort of portfolio of stabilized assets. So that's still at the high end of the 3% to 5% that we've been talking about. But this is pretty typical of the dynamic. As you very well know, when you add in sort of a new set of stabilized assets, sort of sawtooths the growth a little bit up. And then as you increase utilization and sort of tap out that growth, it might tend to sort of come back down a little bit. And then ROIC goes a little bit in the opposite direction. It's sort of impaired by the fact that these are less mature, but then I think would tend to rise back. And so overall, we feel really good about stabilized assets. And I think they are a reflection of the strength of the business model. <br/>Billable cabs, yes, for sure, definitely good solid quarter in Americas. APAC is coming off a really strong quarter last quarter and so it was flat this one. EMEA actually had sort of no meaningful adds the last couple of quarters. And I know that creates a little sort of mental dissonance for people to see a couple of quarters without billable cabs. But I think it's important to remember that really the dynamics of the business as such, in EMEA, actually, if you look at 8 quarter, 12 quarter trend, we've actually had a lot of strength there in terms of cabinet adds and you get into a situation where essentially you start seeing high utilization rates in certain markets. Therefore, you're probably going to see a little less large footprint and then you actually start sort of a cycle of looking for good churn to try to make room. And that kind of -- can lead to some flat spots, I think, from billable cabs. But we will always encourage people to really look at a longer-term trend. We clearly will grow, can, will and need to grow billable cabs across all 3 regions. And with the size of the development pipeline that we have, that will happen.<br/>But let me give you just a data point on -- in Europe, one of the things -- this happened in Europe, and it gives -- I think it's something to sort of hang your hat on and really reinforce why we talk so much about our strategy and maintaining discipline in our strategy because we could turn ourselves into cabinet flingers and that's really not what we want. And so if you look at Europe, we actually had a churn this quarter in a market that is very tight, about 440 cabs. And that was -- it was a pretty low dense implementation from a power density standpoint and not really well interconnected. And so we were getting a cabinet yield there well below our average. <br/>When we go to resell that, we will likely resell that in significantly more small to midsized deals than sort of one big footprint. And when you look at what's likely to happen there, we're probably going to increase the revenue and therefore, the yield per cabinet,. When you get more interconnection, higher power density and a higher price point, we'll probably increase the revenue from those 440 cabs 50% from that capacity, when all is said and done. And so the significant growth with no billable -- essentially 0 increase in billable cabs and no incremental CapEx.<br/>And so this is why when you hear us talk constantly about right customer, right application, right assets, and that's more than just a sort of a clever thing for the earnings call, that's a way of life here in terms of how we drive our sales team. And I think that gives you kind of a good reflection. So you will see the billable cab growth, but I think right now, you're seeing good healthy growth across those because I think we're playing every lever, power density, price point, interconnection, and I think it's really driving health in the business.",
			"<strong>Jonathan Atkin</strong>",
			"And then if I can follow up on AI. You mentioned some wins there. And what are we seeing in terms of rough sizes? Are they -- do they tend to be very cost connect rich or more density rich, or what -- how should we kind of qualify and characterize the AI demand you're seeing so far?",
			"<strong>Charles J. Meyers</strong>",
			"Yes. I think it's a little early to tell, but we have seen -- it's interesting because ChatGPT has created a media frenzy around AI. But the reality is we've seen AI-related opportunities in our pipeline for the last several years. And for those that are familiar with the story and out on the investor circuit with us, you've heard me talk about that. And I think that most typically, it is people thinking about how to use their data and where to place their data. And what we're seeing is actually a trend towards people saying, we want to take our data and place it sort of inter cloud. We want to have control of that data. We want to intersect it with other data sources and we want to be able to move it into and out of clouds as appropriate for these things. And so we have seen some large training -- model training opportunities. Those are partially economically driven, just it's actually cheaper to do on sort of dedicated hardware if you have sort of a sustained commitment to doing AI training. And so we've seen some of those. <br/>And then inference deals, which I think are going to be a bit more interconnected, are where people are actually deploying inference, AI inference use cases that are sort of -- and I think where we're going to be uniquely well suited is when insights are both, one, when data sets are dynamic and they're updated frequently, and they're taking in a lot of new data. And secondly, where insights are real-time and mission-critical. I think -- and that really doesn't sort of fit the profile of the way current large language models like ChatGPT are being used. But we do think that what's going to happen is people are going to build vertically oriented sort of AI use cases on top of foundational models that are going to be sort of cloud-centric. And I think that we're going to be well suited to responding to some of those opportunities. So I think it's going to be a mix.<br/>I actually think some of the training stuff, Jonathan, is going to be more suited to our xScale portfolio. And I think some of the inference stuff is probably going to land in the retail portfolio at the digital edge. And so that's sort of the current dynamic, but early days, but I think an exciting incremental opportunity, and we're going to talk a little bit more about that at Analyst Day.",

			"First, Keith, I thought some of your comments about Singapore and the opportunities to monetize that space are pretty interesting. I mean is the plan to just move those customers across the strait to Johor or some other market, or are they going to be let go? How impactful do you think this might be over time and when might it re: your results? And are there other markets where this might come into play or is Singapore kind of a unique situation?",
			"<strong>Keith D. Taylor</strong>",
			"Well, first, it dovetails nicely the point that Charles was really talking about in the European theater, where you have a tight market, you make some decisions about looking to optimize the environment. And with that, sometimes customers move out some of the large deployments. As it relates specifically to Singapore, my reference was no different really than again, what Charles is talking about. But we do see an opportunity. There happens to be a larger installation related to a customer. And it maybe it does move to a different market for us, and that would be fine. But the real focus is getting capacity in the Singapore market, getting a price uplift and again, going back to what Charles talked about, that we are sort of maybe with the bread crumbs that we see something that we're looking at right now that is going to be upsized. And of course, when we do that, it has an impact on the net cabinets billing. And of course, it has an impact on our churn metric. I maintain, though, our word churn is going to be at the lower end of our range for the year. So I'm not worried about that. But this billing cabinet metric is the one that we're always sort of looking at, causes us a little bit of discomfort because we know we're doing the right thing for the business and yet it presents itself maybe a little bit unfairly to us. And so the bottom line is that's an initiative that we would embark upon.<br/>And Singapore is not the only market, any place that we see that opportunity. And again, I refer back to Charles' comment, where we don't need -- where we can get an uplift, an optimization of the asset. We don't have to put more capital to work and you're driving value into the equation. And so that's just a real good outcome for us. And if we can do that in places we are tight and there is the demand, we'll make sure that we do it.",
			"<strong>Charles J. Meyers</strong>",
			"Yes. Nick, I'd offer a little bit more color in that saying, we have a few examples where I think we have footprints that probably would have been better suited to xScale facilities had we had them at the time that we took them, that now we are sort of saying, hey, that we would really need that capacity for -- to fuel the retail footprint. And obviously, in Singapore, where there's a broader sort of capacity constraint concern, it's really critical that we recapture those.<br/>And so -- but there are other markets where I think we see some of that opportunity and other markets in which some of these capacity constraints might come into play. And it's also one of the reasons why I think we have to continue to lean in on sustainability. And the connection between those things is, I think, for us to make sure that we're going to be in line to get the power allocations needed, the permits needed, et cetera, to continue to drive capacity in markets where jurisdictions are quite reasonably looking at how to manage their energy needs. I think it's going to be important that we are able to say, hey, we're the responsible party to partner with to continue to be a digital leader but be that in a really very responsible way. So a lot of sort of interconnections between those various thoughts and threads.",
			"<strong>Nicholas Ralph Del Deo</strong>",
			"That's great. That's great. Charles, can I ask one on interconnection. You talked about bit how adds came back in Q1 versus Q4, still below trend, though. Can you share any updated expectations regarding when we should see that grooming dynamic abate and get adds back to more normal levels?",
			"<strong>Charles J. Meyers</strong>",
			"Absolutely. Yes, as I noted, there's a few on the last call and in the script, there's a few factors that play out interconnection. Overall, one thing I'd say is traffic levels continue to be really attractive. You're seeing that in Exchange. You're seeing that in terms of in Fabric overall provision capacity. It's a little tougher for us to tell on physical cross-connects exactly how much traffic is flowing because we don't [light] the electronics on those things. But it's fair to say that I think what you're seeing is a trend towards significantly higher speeds to support higher and higher traffic. And by the way, I think AI is going to only add fuel to that fire. So gross adds have been strong. That's one of the things that we really look at is, say, how many gross adds are there. And I think that's a primary indicator of health, and those have been very much in line with the 4 quarter averages.<br/>There is some grooming activity. As I said last quarter, we thought that would moderate. It did moderate to some degree, but was still there at an elevated level. I do think people are going to run out of low-hanging fruit on that one. And so I think that we'll eventually see more moderation there and that will help the net adds further. I think this trend towards higher speeds, though, is a more sustained trend. And so I think we're just going to have to look at kind of how -- where things settle out. We've seen this in the past where traffic is sort of catching up to provision capacity a little bit. And so -- but again, I think the long-term trend here is very high degrees of traffic flow, higher degrees of interconnection.<br/>The diversity we're seeing in the interconnection system and ecosystem is increasingly rich. So more A to Z in sort of unique connections. And overall, just the strength is good. So 12% revenue growth, a little lighter on the unit side. I do think we'll see some more moderation of the grooming per se, but I do think that, that will be offset, that we'll still see a little bit more in terms of fewer higher speed circuits. And so we'll just -- we'll continue to track that. <br/>But I'll give you the punchline here. Interconnection is well north of a $1 billion business for us, growing at 12% at very, very attractive returns on capital. And I think that the opportunity for us to continue to sort of lean into that and grow that business, particularly as we grow Fabric and as we think about what the bigger cloud networking opportunity looks like and what our role in it is, is -- continues to be a big part of the Equinix story.",

			"I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about pricing outside of the power price increases. We certainly heard a lot on the hyperscale side of prices firming, and you referenced some of the capacity constraints in the market. So what are you seeing both in xScale and then also just in your core business around the opportunities to continue to take price, both on new business and on renewals? And then maybe a little bit on Metal, both in terms of customer adoption and in terms of your continuing to roll out the product across your footprint?",
			"<strong>Charles J. Meyers</strong>",
			"Lots in there. So let me try to hit them all. So yes, pricing is definitely firm. Obviously, PPIs have gotten a lot of airtime, but I think perhaps an even more important trend is our ability to sort of sustain pricing power on sort of the broader portfolio of service offerings. And so we have elevated our costs on space, power and interconnection from a list price perspective across all our markets. And so I think you're going to see that continuing to sort of roll into the business. xScale pricing has definitely firmed in -- across the world. And so I think we're seeing attractive price points and good solid cash and cash returns on the product projects that we're underwriting. And as we said, we got a very high degree of pre-leasing there. And so -- and again, we've raised pricing both on the retail side, space, power and on the interconnection units. <br/>So we have -- and then you have the escalators and we are -- our escalators are also going up. And so in some cases, we're doing CPI or other index-based escalators, but then more broadly, if we're doing fixed escalators, they are much higher than they have been in the past. And so I think we're seeing all of that roll through as a clear dynamic in the business in terms of and you're seeing it show up in MRR per cab, right? I mean we gave you a headline stat there in Keith's script about how MRR per cab is increasing. Yes, a big chunk of it due to PPI. But even absent that, I think our yield per cab, which is an absolutely critical metric for us, continues to rise.<br/>So -- and then on Metal, we talked a couple -- about a couple of really nice wins. We are really cultivating early users in what is more of a product-led growth motion that's probably a little bit more typical of SaaS providers. And so we're cutting our teeth on that, to be candid, but we're getting the hang of it. And we are seeing some uptake from developers and from sort of digitally native service providers. And we're also seeing some pretty big opportunities in our funnel about more traditional service providers or large enterprises looking to reduce the pain of managing the technology life cycle, and Metal really helps with that. So we'll probably talk more about that at the Analyst Day as well. But good -- continue to feel good about the underlying drivers of that business and kind of why we did that acquisition in the first place.",

			"I guess, Keith, I just want to make sure we all have the right jumping off point. So thank you for the waterfall for the 2Q EBITDA guide. And I just wanted to understand the combination of forces of the kind of impact of the roll-off of the hedges and the kind of increased usage as they kind of merged together to kind of create this $43 million kind of move down at the midpoint. And then assuming that that's the right jumping off point, that these hedges are the right levels for the rest of the year, it implies about a $14 million sequential EBITDA growth in 3Q and 4Q to get to the midpoint of the full year guide. Could you talk a little bit about what the drivers of that will look like? Is it going to be kind of a steady cost structure with pretty much volume and price being the drivers of the margin? Any color there would be super helpful.",
			"<strong>Keith D. Taylor</strong>",
			"Sure. Well. Thanks, David, and thanks for sort of laying it out there. And I think, first, if you start on the red line and you look at sort of the quarter-over-quarter movement, the first thing you notice is that it is not an overly substantial increase quarter-over-quarter coming off such a big number from Q1 relative to Q4 last quarter. But one of the things you'll appreciate, and I know it was hand sort of built into my comments in my script, nonrecurring revenue is moving around quite a bit. And right now, we're making the underlying assumption that it's not hitting in any specific quarter. And so what you're seeing is a meaningful step down in nonrecurring revenue between Q1 and Q2. So that's the first thing. And so you feel that in many different ways, but you certainly do feel it on the EBITDA line as well. <br/>The second thing is sort of attached to that is xScale, we are -- as Charles alluded to in his script, we sold out one complete asset in Frankfurt, and we are very active in some -- across all 3 regions of the world, and we anticipate a lot more xScale activity. And so you'll see that play itself out into the year or throughout the rest of the year. Right now, our NRR trends about 5% of revenue for the year. I think it's probably going to be roughly 5% of revenue. But the range is going to be somewhere between 4.2% and about 7% and between the next 3 quarters. And we don't know exactly where, so we haven't really guided as well as we maybe would want to given the set of circumstances. <br/>And then the last piece, I'd just say, look, there's an element of conservatism built into our model here, for obvious reasons. And again, we're trying to be very prudent about what we look at. We give you -- we know what we did for the first quarter. We're running a little bit ahead. That was, again, associated with xScale, the xScale fees. But as we look forward, we really just wanted, to at this stage of the game, give you the FX and then continue to look at what's going on in the business.<br/>As it relates specifically to the power and the power costs, again, no surprise. We've been very thoughtful about the power dynamics for this year and the power price increases. And we had to factor in and look exactly what was the cost going to be for the year, including when do the hedges roll off and when do some others start and what's going on, and in the regulatory -- the regulated environment. And then there are some other markets that we are going to be putting price increases through effective on May 1, and that's Hong Kong and Tokyo. So looking at all of that, more specifically, our costs are going up. And so you're going to feel that throughout the rest of the year. It's baked into the guide already. It was baked into the original guide. So this isn't a shift, and what you should see is really EBITDA profitability continue to increase throughout the rest of the year. <br/>So again, I think we've got the making of a really good plan here, but we're going to -- we're sort of holding firm on what we hopefully shared with you when we started the year, knowing that one other thing that's really working in our favor is currency. And again, we get a little bit of currency, but we're all sort of reading the same thing. If you look at what the U.S. dollar could do anywhere between now and the next 12 months, some are calling for a 5% depreciation, some are calling as high as a 15% depreciation of the U.S. dollar. And 60% of our revenues reside outside of the U.S., and you don't have to go very far to figure out what is the implication of that,. If 60% of our revenues move 5% or 15% before taking into consideration the hedges, you have a really substantial move on top line and on bottom line, and that drives a lot of value on a per share basis.<br/>So hopefully, that gives you sort of a full look at all the things we're thinking about and are trying to share with you. But at this point, we felt really comfortable just sort of holding firm on our guide and just give you a little bit of FX and some operating performance coming out of Q1.",
			"<strong>Charles J. Meyers</strong>",
			"Yes. Maybe Dave, a little bit of more color is that I think -- I will tell you that we are also focused on every element of the business model. So if you look at the revenue line, say, P x Q, we feel very good about P, continue to feel good about Q and we're going to continue to work the heck out of that. I would say that at the next sort of a click down on cost of goods, we're continuing to drive efficiency sort of projects across the business to try to improve cost of goods and gross margin. Then when you look down further, I also think, just given the broader [amount], we're going to continue to be diligent on spend. We did spend -- we opened up the wallet a bit to make sure we can add some more headcount when we're trying to bring them up to productivity as quickly as possible. But you saw flat SG&amp;A spend quarter-over-quarter, and we're going to continue to be very disciplined about that as well. And so we're going to work every element of the model and continue to do what we need to do to try to deliver the long-term performance.",

			"Just first, you talked about organic and inorganic opportunities. Just wondering if you could give us a sense of the markets that you're prioritizing or perhaps regions that you're prioritizing from that perspective. And then also, there were some press reports out earlier today suggesting that Equinix is exploring the sale of its Hong Kong data center assets. Maybe without commenting on that specifically, just at a high level, do you view capital recycling this year as a likely option?",
			"<strong>Charles J. Meyers</strong>",
			"While we -- I'll take the first one and then Keith can comment on the second one there relative to Hong Kong. But on M&amp;A, as I said, I do think there's opportunities for us. We've talked about where some of those markets might be. I think Southeast Asia is going to continue to be an area of opportunity, we believe, over time, and there are several key markets there that I think we've got our eyes on. We've actually done a couple of organic projects already in Indonesia and Malaysia, and we're going to continue to stay sort of eyes very wide open in terms of opportunities for us in that area. <br/>India, we've announced a new build in Chennai, but I do think there's a lot of opportunity in India, and I think that could be a combination over time of organic and inorganic. And I think that we also -- I think one of the things that we have not done a lot of -- or we haven't done any of it yet, but I think that could be on radar is thinking about opportunities from an xScale perspective in partnership with our partners. All of those probably represent some level of opportunity for us in M&amp;A. And I think as we look at some of the dynamics and opportunities in the market, including AI, I think that could be -- those could be all very relevant for us. So that's the first question, and then I'll kick it over to Keith and he can talk a bit about this capital recycling question.",
			"<strong>Keith D. Taylor</strong>",
			"Yes. Thanks, Charles. So Michael, I'd say a few things. First and foremost, we typically are not a recycler of assets. I think you have to step back, and we said this actually in one of the Analyst Days, I think it was -- might have been the last one, we're -- basically we're a platform and all assets are very important to the platform. And in particular, Hong Kong is a very important asset to us and something that is important to our platform. So we don't think about the business as selling assets, but we do also -- we do think about ways -- innovative ways to allow us to scale and grow the business. And an example of that is our Jakarta business, where we recently entered into a partnership with a large conglomerate so that we go into that market in tandem. And it just -- it's an innovative way to actually to raise capital. And so overall, we're not in the business of selling assets, but we're always looking across our portfolio and trying to figure out how to optimize the capital structure. And I think that sort of best reflects our view that the platform, the Equinix platform is critically important to all the different assets that we have in our portfolio.",

			"A couple of questions. First, and I realize it's still somewhat early in the year, but as you're looking forward and trying to manage power costs, what's your sense of where these power price increases or maybe future decreases are heading from what you see across the market portfolio for 2024? <br/>And then just secondly, as we take a step back and the market tries to contemplate the forward growth opportunity for Equinix, is it helpful to consider the company's position on 3 vectors, the percentage coverage of core global market, the percent penetration of key customer cohorts and where the wallet level is, especially when you break out past the top 50 customers? And is that something that you can give us a bit of an update on today?",
			"<strong>Charles J. Meyers</strong>",
			"Sure. I'll start and Keith can jump in here. Obviously, very hard for us, we can't predict anything on power. I would say that I would expect, in general, more volatility rather than less, right? I think we're living in a volatile world. I think there's a lot of still dynamics at play in terms that could impact power pricing, broadly speaking. And now the good news is, is that I think that, again, we've -- this opportunity for us over the last almost a year to really educate our customers about how we go about energy procurement and what it means and how it dampens volatility and why that's good for them and why it gives them budget predictability, et cetera, are all things that I think have been really good for us. Obviously, you look at in sort of deregulated markets where we can hedge, we're going to dampen that volatility out. And so -- and again, we don't know -- there definitely have been markets that have come down in price over the last several months, but recognize that customers were enjoying a very different price point than what was the spot was at in sort of the latter part of '22 and early '23. And so they were really -- that was a huge benefit to them. <br/>And now some markets have moderated substantially. And some people predict that they will continue to moderate further. But I think others predict, particularly in Europe, that unless we get some sort of resolution to the conflict in Ukraine, that we likely have more volatility. And even I think the fact that we -- that an energy transformation is underway in Europe under any circumstance that is going to be a decade-long -- multi-decade long in nature, I'd expect more volatility rather than less.<br/>And I think our approach to the market and how we've approached hedging, et cetera, provides real benefit, so -- but we'll continue to sort of monitor that. I do think in some cases, we're seeing some benefits in terms of power prices being a little lower than we expected in some places. We are going to have some of the hedges roll off in Q2, and we talked about that in the script. So you're going to see some elevation there. And so that shouldn't be a surprise in the quarter. But I definitely think it's going to continue to be a volatile overall market. Before I go to the other question, you wanted to add anything on power?",
			"<strong>Keith D. Taylor</strong>",
			"The only thing I would add, Michael, to Charles' comments, the other aspect of it is operationally, we are highly focused on running the business more efficiently. We're very renewable and sustainability focused. And as a business, we want to continue to make sure we drive down the overall cost of the business. And so that's going to be an important aspect on a go-forward basis. And Charles also made the comments in his prepared remarks around PPAs and our desire to go into contractual arrangement with, whether it's wind or solar, developers and create capacity for the market. And we see that as a bigger part of our business going forward as well. <br/>I think it sort of -- it taps down some of the volatility because it's predictable over an extended period of time, at least those arrangements are. But overall, it's the combination of all those things and our commitment to 100% renewable, just that's a critical aspect of our energy strategy as well.",
			"<strong>Charles J. Meyers</strong>",
			"Yes. And then Mike, on the other one, I think -- I don't want to steal any of my thunder for Analyst Day, but I would say that I think we've always talked about multiple revenue -- multiple growth drivers and levers in our business. Geographic expansion is one of those. So we're covering more markets. What's a core market, that evolves and changes over time. Obviously, we continue to get a huge chunk of our bookings and profits from these sort of scale markets. But what you see is a market start to break into that group. They mature to a certain level, and I think we're going to continue to see that dynamic. The nature of distributed infrastructure continues to drive that. And so you're seeing hyperscalers expand their edge or their presence in both their edge and their core. And we want to be a partner to them in that. And so I think you'll expect -- you should expect us to see continued investment to align with that. And where the digital edge is, it is continuing to evolve. But I do think our commitment is to continue to be that best manifestation. And so I think we're going to continue to see geographic expansion as a driver. <br/>And then in terms of wallet share, I think it's -- one, we are -- we're sort of a -- we're an underlying provider to these companies as they scale their infrastructure. And I think that is allowing us to play in a very significant way, but then also capturing net new markets. I think if you look at service providers, for example, the number of service providers and the life cycle from a small service provider to a scaled service provider is changing in this sort of more cloud-centric world. And so I think we're going to continue to have opportunities against both new market expansion, product line extension and new customer growth. All of those things, I think, are going to be drivers of growth for us over time.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And our next caller is Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.",
			"<strong>Brett Joseph Feldman</strong>",
			"Keith, it was good to hear in your comments, your expectation that you're going to continue to see full year churn towards the low end of the range that you targeted. I think to a casual observer that would sound very surprising, like it's sort of a broadly difficult macro environment, we hear about slowdowns in spending on cloud. And obviously, you pushed through some pretty significant price increases recently. And so I was hoping you can maybe elaborate on what gives you confidence that you're going to continue to see low churn. And then just maybe remind us, when you do see churn, what is driving it? And has that shifted at all from what you've historically seen?",
			"<strong>Keith D. Taylor</strong>",
			"Yes. I think -- first and foremost, it's a great question. And our confidence really comes from the fact that the team does a deep analysis into our customers. And no surprise to you when you look at our top 10 customers, again, it's on the charts, but top 10 customers represent about 18% of our revenues. The top 50 represent about 38 -- or 37%, 38% of our revenues. We have a really long tail. So we have great visibility into -- particularly into our larger customers and what they're doing. So that's the first thing. <br/>The second thing is it's critical infrastructure. And it's not to suggest that companies don't struggle financially or there's consolidation or they choose to bifurcate their infrastructure or even just choose to do something completely different. But overall, when the majority of our growth comes from the installed base and we continue to deliver very high-quality assets with a very high operational standard around the world, we just tend not to suffer the same level of churn that we had previously. And from my point of view, it's the deep analysis that the team has done and the visibility into what we see going forward that gives us confidence that we're not going to see any meaningful churn beyond what we've guided to.<br/>And Brett, now the other -- I think the last thing I would just say that if there's visibility to something that comes in size, we're going to telegraph that anyway. But there's just no indication that, that exists, and it goes back to what is the customer fundamentally doing inside our business and can we grow and scale. And that's what we're seeing, it's those customers continue to buy more services, enter into new services. And then as we introduce new service offerings, I think it's just an enhancement or even a limiter to the amount of churn that we're going to experience as a company because we provide alternatives. So we're not a one-trick pony. So that would give -- that sort of gives you, I guess, the overall sense, and let me leave it there.<br/>Charles, would you add anything?",
			"<strong>Charles J. Meyers</strong>",
			"No. I mean I think we're -- in terms of character of the churn, I think there's a certain amount of our that is more frictional churn associated with people evolving their footprint, how they're serving end customers. That's particularly true in network providers and some other service provider types. I think that -- I think you are seeing -- you are going to continue to see some level of cloud migration. Workloads that are well adapted to the cloud ought to go there. I keep sort of reiterating that. And so I think we see some level of that. But more -- most typically, that is in the context of sort of an evolution towards a long-term hybrid multi-cloud architecture state that really plays to our strengths. <br/>And last comment I would make is that we keep -- we always say this with regard to churn, the best defense against churn is getting the right opportunities to begin with. And so sales discipline and executing, as I talked about earlier and in the script, that's really central to sort of maintaining that churn. And I think our teams have done a great job on that. <br/>And interestingly, I guess the last category I'd give you,- when we do M&amp;A, you find that there's often sort of a churn tail that comes from that because people underwrite to a different sort of an approach. And so you saw that in Verizon, and you look at the -- we now are reaping the other side of that as we sort of managed through that. And I'd tell you, that transaction is looking super attractive, right? And so I think you see some of that, that comes on the back end of M&amp;A transactions. So that's a sort of a third category.",

			"<strong>Joseph Daniel Margolis</strong>",
			"Thank you, Jeff, and thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. We have had an exciting couple of months, and a lot has happened since our fourth quarter earnings call in late February. Operationally, occupancy remained very strong through the first quarter, ending March at 93.5%, our highest first quarter result outside of the COVID years. Our strategy to maintain high occupancy through the winter allowed us to sequentially increase rates to new and existing customers through the first quarter, driving same-store revenue growth of 7.4%. <br/>Same-store expenses were lower than expected due to normalizing payroll expense growth as well as year-over-year savings from repairs and maintenance and property taxes. As expected, our same-store NOI growth rate moderated sequentially from the fourth quarter due to an exceptionally difficult 2022 comparable, and was modestly ahead of our internal projections at 8.7%. We have also been busy on the external growth front. We continue to grow our third-party management platform with net additions of 44 stores. We acquired 6 stores primarily in joint venture structures. We originated $53 million in bridge loans. We started our external growth phase of our remote storage strategy, approving 3 remote model acquisitions, 2 of which are in our primary markets.<br/>Subsequent to quarter end, we closed the second preferred investment with an affiliate of SmartStop in the amount of $150 million. And of course, on April 3, we announced a strategic merger with Life Storage through a leverage neutral, all-stock deal. We believe this combination will produce an even more formidable portfolio, team and platform with over 3,500 stores across 43 states. We anticipate that there are at least $100 million in annual run rate synergies with this transaction that neither company could have created on their own.<br/>So far, everything is on track to successfully complete the merger in the second half of the year. And as we continue to refine our integration plan, we are even more confident that we can achieve at least our stated synergies.<br/>Further, there are additional potential growth drivers and synergies not captured in the minimum target of $100 million. These include additional expense savings due to increased scale, a lower cost of capital, a 50% increase in data, which could further improve property performance, a larger pool of properties to evaluate opportunities such as expansion, redevelopment and solar installation, and finally, broader industry relationships, which will provide greater reach and scale to offer potential products and services and build our acquisition pipeline.<br/>We are working hard to complete the pending merger, and I appreciate the efforts of the teams from both companies and the way they have remained focused on driving the existing business as we enter the busy leasing season.<br/>I would now like to turn the time over to Scott.",
			"<strong>P. Scott Stubbs</strong>",
			"Thank you, Joe, and hello, everyone. As Joe mentioned, we had another good quarter, beating our internal FFO projections by $0.04. The beat was driven by better-than-expected property net operating income, lower G&amp;A and higher management fees and tenant insurance. Interest income and interest expense both came in modestly lower than modeled, generally offsetting each other. Achieved rates to new customers have been improving -- have been improving sequentially since bottoming out in November. In January, year-over-year rates improved to approximately negative 14%. In February, they were negative 11%, and in March, they were negative 3%. <br/>We did see lower rental volume in March at those rates. And in April, our pricing algorithms dropped rates modestly, with average achieved rates in April closer to negative 7% year-over-year, contributing to higher rental volumes in April. Turning to the balance sheet. We completed a $500 million bond offering of 5-year notes with a coupon of 5.7%. We used the proceeds to reduce our revolver balances to less than $100 million at the end of the quarter, leaving over $1 billion in revolving capacity. We reduced our floating interest rate exposure to 22% of total debt, net of variable rate receivables.<br/>Shortly after the announcement of our proposed merger with Life Storage, S&amp;P Global updated our rating to credit watch positive, confirming its view that the proposed transaction is credit-enhancing given the increase in scale and potential synergy opportunities. We reaffirmed our guidance ranges for same-store growth expectations and core FFO, which do not include the impact of the proposed merger with Life Storage. We made modifications to our 2023 outlook to capture the SmartStop preferred investment, delays in bridge loan closings, the impact of our bond deal on interest expense and other adjustments to tenant insurance and G&amp;A. <br/>Property net operating income in the first quarter was modestly ahead of our expectations. As we progress through the leasing season, we will monitor achieved rates to new customers, rental and vacate trends, web traffic and top-of-funnel demand before revisiting these guidance ranges after the second quarter. As mentioned on our fourth quarter call, our guidance assumes positive same-store revenue growth for and throughout the full year. It assumes that growth rate moderates more quickly in the first half of the year due to exceptionally difficult first half comps, troughs in the summer and modestly reaccelerates late in the year.<br/>Much of our NOI growth is offset by the first-year headwind of our investment in nonstabilized properties, which carry approximately $0.23 of dilution, the modification of the NexPoint preferred investment and higher interest rates. While each of these headwinds slows our 2023 growth, we believe they will result in stronger long-term growth rates over a multiyear period for our shareholders. We are off to a great start in 2023. We believe storage as an asset class is among the most resilient in the REIT space and that the sector will continue to produce healthy, albeit moderating year-over-year growth.<br/>We believe our operating platform and highly diversified portfolio will become even stronger through the Life Storage merger and are well positioned for another solid year.<br/>With that, operator, let's open it up for questions.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Todd Thomas from KeyBanc.",
			"<strong>Todd Michael Thomas</strong>",
			"I just wanted first to ask about occupancy in April. If you could talk a little bit about any post-quarter updates there, where you stand year-over-year and just talk about rental demand coming out of March, a little bit in greater detail?",
			"<strong>P. Scott Stubbs</strong>",
			"Yes. Our occupancy at the end of April increased about 30 basis points. At the end of April, we were 93.8%. So we actually are in a good position moving into the rental season. We saw good rental activity during the month of April.",
			"<strong>Todd Michael Thomas</strong>",
			"Okay. And within the guidance framework, where would you expect to see occupancy kind of peak in June, July? It seems like the quarter-end occupancy, which was about 10 basis points below the quarter average, was a little unusual from a seasonal standpoint. Are you pleased with the occupancy improvements that you're seeing? Is it a little bit below what you were anticipating? And yes, if you could just talk about what you expect in terms of the peak during the rental season?",
			"<strong>P. Scott Stubbs</strong>",
			"Yes. So as we did our guidance, we focused obviously on revenue. But in that number, we do assume that occupancy is a negative delta compared to last year, less than 1%. You're up against 2 of the toughest years, the last 2 years with the COVID peaks, but there is a slight negative headwind with occupancy. Throughout the entire year, it's pretty consistent.",
			"<strong>Todd Michael Thomas</strong>",
			"Okay. And last question, in terms of the guidance, so you updated the dilution that you expect from C of O and value-add acquisitions was $0.25 initially, it's $0.23. Is that -- what's driving that? And is that related to the guidance going forward for the balance of the year? Or I mean is that the full year dilution that's actually been increased and -- or decreased and is an improvement relative to the initial guidance?",
			"<strong>P. Scott Stubbs</strong>",
			"It's actually an improvement of $0.02 compared to initial guidance, and it's from 2 things, lease-up properties are filling up faster and then it assumes that the timing on a couple of the C of Os and acquisitions has bumped back slightly.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Michael, you might have your phone on mute.<br/>Moving on. Our next question then comes from the line of Juan Sanabria from BMO.",
			"<strong>Juan Carlos Sanabria</strong>",
			"Joe, I think you mentioned at the top, the remote storage acquisitions. Could you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing early days there? And what the opportunity set could be going forward? And any thoughts about how that could tie in with Life Storage recognizing its early days there?",
			"<strong>Joseph Daniel Margolis</strong>",
			"I don't know if everyone is having this problem. We have a very bad connection. Could you repeat the question, please? We couldn't hear it here.",
			"<strong>Juan Carlos Sanabria</strong>",
			"Sure. Is that better?",
			"<strong>Joseph Daniel Margolis</strong>",
			"A little bit, yes.",
			"<strong>Juan Carlos Sanabria</strong>",
			"Just curious, Joe, you talked about the remote storage investments in the first quarter.",
			"<strong>Joseph Daniel Margolis</strong>",
			"We can't hear. We can't... Jeff, we need to dial in somehow.",
			"<strong>Jeffrey Norman</strong>",
			"Juan, give us just one minute, we're going to change....",
			"<strong>Juan Carlos Sanabria</strong>",
			"Sure, is this any better.",
			"<strong>Jeffrey Norman</strong>",
			"Give us one moment. Okay. Juan, go ahead and try that again.",
			"<strong>Juan Carlos Sanabria</strong>",
			"Sure. No problem. Just curious -- Joe, you mentioned remote storage acquisitions in the first quarter. Just curious on what early learnings are and what that opportunity set is? And if there's any tie-ins or expansion opportunities to that opportunity with the Life Storage pending transaction, just curious on bigger picture thoughts on what that could represent for you guys?",
			"<strong>Joseph Daniel Margolis</strong>",
			"Sure. It's a great question. So with respect to the opportunity set, I think it's massive, right? The number of small stores in our markets that we traditionally would not look at for acquisition because we could not efficiently manage them without permanent 100% on-site management is huge, and not only existing stores, but just vacant space we can turn into storage that is small. And then we will undertake an effort to go through the Life Storage portfolio and see which of their stores would be candidates for this type of different management model. So it is an exciting opportunity set that we will look at.",
			"<strong>Juan Carlos Sanabria</strong>",
			"And is there a different margin that these remote storage spaces are capable of generating?",
			"<strong>Joseph Daniel Margolis</strong>",
			"I think the margin is not different, but the efficiencies gained by manage them through the remote platform makes the margins acceptable, right? You can get to the right margin because you have the reduced expenses. If that makes sense.",
			"<strong>Juan Carlos Sanabria</strong>",
			"Okay. Yes, it does. And then just curious, you talked about and seemingly are very confident on the synergies from the pending LSI transaction. I was hoping maybe you could just unpack a little bit what's driving that increased enthusiasm post the transaction being announced?",
			"<strong>Joseph Daniel Margolis</strong>",
			"Well, we're certainly learning more about the opportunities within the Life Storage portfolio and the synergies we could gain by combining that portfolio with ours. I'll give you just one simple example. In our underwriting, we assumed we would need to have 6 new regional offices. We've now gone through everything, and we're going to end up with 4 regional offices. So that's just one example of many kind of incremental savings that we think we can achieve. And we also become more and more confident on the revenue synergies as we learn more and more.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And our next question comes from the line of Samir Khanal from Evercore ISI.",
			"<strong>Samir Upadhyay Khanal</strong>",
			"(technical difficulty)<br/>You've implemented -- just trying to -- whether it's markets regionally, anything you've seen, clearly, we've had the headline risk out there with the banks, the regional banks. I'm just wondering, is there any signs that you're seeing at all at this point?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey Norman</strong>",
			"Samir, we lost. We only picked up about the second half of your question. Could you repeat the full question?",
			"<strong>Samir Upadhyay Khanal</strong>",
			"I was asking about whether you're seeing any pushback from existing customers on price increases, whether it's -- we've seen a lot of headlines over the last few months, right, regional banks having issues. I don't know if you can make some comments around markets where you see maybe occupancy drops or bad debt pickup? Just trying to see any sort of things that may -- on the negative side or pushback that you may have been getting from existing customers on the price increases.",
			"<strong>Joseph Daniel Margolis</strong>",
			"So it's a good kind of health-of-the-customer question. And to answer specifically your question, we have not. We peaked out at about 800 basis points greater move out from customers who receive the ECRIs than those who didn't. And that has trailed back down towards the more normal rate and it has stabilized in a number that's a little higher than normal, but our ECRIs are a little higher than normal. So still a very manageable number and justifies the program. But we also see signs of health in the customer in our very low bad debt under 2%, and willingness of customers on the demand side. The strength of demand, which frankly isn't as good as it was during the COVID years, it is pretty comparables. Demand is still strong in this sector.",
			"<strong>Samir Upadhyay Khanal</strong>",
			"Okay. Got it. And I guess, for Scott, just as a second question, I know in the last earnings call, you spoke about expense pressures that you could face this year. I mean you're doing about 3.5% growth in the first quarter. Maybe talk us through kind of what you're expecting for expense pressures? And maybe what are you seeing so far sort of year-to-date?",
			"<strong>P. Scott Stubbs</strong>",
			"So if you look at our expenses, payroll is progressing as expected. We expected it to go back to more moderate pace than what we've seen in the past year. And we saw that at 3.9% in the first quarter, and we would expect that to continue to moderate as we move throughout the year.<br/>Moving to the other big expense items, payroll -- property taxes were actually a benefit to us in the quarter. We were negative and we would not expect that throughout the remainder of the year. We would expect that to be an inflationary plus. The other one that was a benefit in the quarter is snow removal, which living in Utah, we never want to guess we had lower snow removal throughout the rest of the U.S., but it was actually a benefit for us in the quarter.<br/>In terms of other expense items that we expect some potential pressure moving forward, we do our property -- we renew our property in casualty insurance first of June, and we would expect that to see another sizable bump similar to what I think everybody's experiencing.",
			"<strong>Samir Upadhyay Khanal</strong>",
			"And what's -- just as a follow-up, what's the size of it? Can you just sort of quantify that as we think about from a modeling perspective?",
			"<strong>P. Scott Stubbs</strong>",
			"We're still in the early phases, but it's definitely double digits, and could be significant. The other expense item that ran at 11% in the quarter is marketing, and we'll use that as needed throughout the year if we find that we find positive returns on our marketing spend and we can spend that instead of cutting rates. Obviously, that's the first area we'll look.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And our next question comes from the line of Keegan Carl from Wolfe Research.",
			"<strong>Keegan Grant Carl</strong>",
			"Maybe first just on your same-store pool breakouts, can you help us better understand the outperformance of the 2023 full relative to the 2022 pool, especially given that occupancy was higher in the 2022 pool?",
			"<strong>P. Scott Stubbs</strong>",
			"Yes. Your benefit comes from adding properties that are finishing the final stages of lease up and those properties either came from C of O properties or acquisitions. And so as they stabilize, rates typically continue to outperform the same-store pool. Our definition goes back to our IPO of our same-store pool, and that's 80% occupancy, or we have to own them for a year. So we do see some benefit. If you look at the 3 pools in our subs, and each year, it gets a little slower.",
			"<strong>Keegan Grant Carl</strong>",
			"Okay. No, that's helpful. And then I guess on the acquisition market, just kind of curious, what are you guys seeing as far as volumes and cap rates? And how should we be thinking about it the rest of the year? And I guess, as an adjacent 1 to that, I mean, how is it impacting your bridge lending program?",
			"<strong>Joseph Daniel Margolis</strong>",
			"Good question. So volumes in the transaction market are significantly down. There's not a lot of distress in the self-storage market, so sellers don't have to sell. And if they don't get the price they want, they don't sell. So there's a significant bid-ask spread. The deals we do see trade all seem to have some unique story. Not sure there's enough of a market to tell you what cap rates are because everything seems to be unique. And unfortunately, our bridge loan volumes were slower in the first quarter than we expected. <br/>Now that being said, there is some seasonality to this business. If you look back at 3 or 4 years we've been doing this, we always end up closing the most loans or proving the most loans in the second half of the year. So we hope we follow the same pattern, but we were a little slower than expected in the first quarter.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith from UBS.",
			"<strong>Michael Goldsmith</strong>",
			"Can anyone hear me?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey Norman</strong>",
			"We can year you now.",
			"<strong>Michael Goldsmith</strong>",
			"Okay. Great. My first question is just about the cadence through the -- this quarter. You talked about street rates moving from down 14% to down 3% January through March. And then kind of returning back down to 7% in April. It sounds like from a lot of your peers that March was a particularly challenging month. So I was wondering what you were seeing that -- are you able to kind of parse out what was going on between the demand side relative to where you set rates versus just kind of like the overall demand environment in March and how that translated into April?",
			"<strong>Joseph Daniel Margolis</strong>",
			"Yes, I don't want to overstate the difficulties of March, right? I think we pushed a little harder with rates than maybe we should, which is fine, right? That's what the algorithm should do. They should try to find that point of resistance. And we went from minus 11% in February all the way to minus 3% in March, and we did see that there was some weakness at that level and the systems brought things back and we're recovering. So yes, March wasn't the best month in our last 4 months. But overall, the last 4 months have been strong. It's been good for us. As Scott says, we're overperforming our expectations.",
			"<strong>Michael Goldsmith</strong>",
			"And my follow-up is related to the bridge lending program. Can you provide a little bit more color on just kind of the reasoning why deals may have been falling out? I would think this would be a good environment for bridge lending. And sort of related to that, there was a nice pickup in the third-party management net stores that you added. So can you just talk a little bit about the appetite for kind of independent players looking for third-party management in this environment?",
			"<strong>Joseph Daniel Margolis</strong>",
			"Sure. So with respect to bridge loans, you have a couple of things going on. One, you have seasonality, which I mentioned. The second is, we had a couple of deals get dropped, deals we had already signed a term sheet, collected a commitment fee, was in our numbers for pipeline and the borrower walked on the commitment fee. And then we had a couple that were delayed. So normal, I think, volatility in a business, and we will hope to pick it up in the second half of the year. <br/>With respect to management, we had a great quarter. We picked up 11 stores from NexPoint as part of our strategic relationship with them, and the 37 other stores and the churn is much less in the management business. We only lost 4 stores in the quarter because the transaction market is so slow. And 1 of those we bought into a JV. So we had a great start to our management business. We expect to have a great second quarter as well. And it's 1 of the advantages of having multiple growth drivers is that when 1 might be growing a little more slowly, another 1 could be growing a little more quickly. And it always allows us to grow the overall enterprise.",
			"<strong>Michael Goldsmith</strong>",
			"Can you provide a little bit more specifics around why some of the bridge lending deals would be dropped? Are they -- is it a reflection of the self-storage environment? Is it reflect like the lending environment, the appetite for others to land? I'm just trying to get a sense of kind of new factors surrounding that bridge loan program.",
			"<strong>Joseph Daniel Margolis</strong>",
			"So some of our bridge loans are commitments to issue the loan upon completion of construction, right, because we won't lend until the property has a C of O and is operational. And when the project gets built and the C of O is issued, if the owner has a different plan, maybe he sells the property instead of borrowing it or maybe finances it some other way, they have the option to walk from their commitment fee and not take the loan.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from Truist.",
			"<strong>Ki Bin Kim</strong>",
			"So first question, your New York City Metro area same-store revenue decelerated a little bit further than your portfolio average. I'm not sure what was the cause. If it is a comp issue, or if you're seeing additional pressures in the new supply deliveries in Northern New Jersey, but any kind of color you can share would be helpful.",
			"<strong>Joseph Daniel Margolis</strong>",
			"I think those certainly are both important factors to that. I think you've circled that Ki Bin.",
			"<strong>Ki Bin Kim</strong>",
			"Okay. And in terms of the LSI merger and the synergy math that you've talked about, a lot of the focus has been about getting the synergies from the LSI portfolio, but I was wondering if you can maybe take a different perspective and look at it from a combined basis, what is the upside from the combined company in terms of improving the overall NOI picture -- NOI margin picture and maybe close the gap between you and your larger peer?",
			"<strong>Joseph Daniel Margolis</strong>",
			"What was the gap in terms of margin?",
			"<strong>Ki Bin Kim</strong>",
			"Yes.",
			"<strong>Joseph Daniel Margolis</strong>",
			"So I think margin is a difficult thing to compare because it's not apples and apples, right? So for example, if 1 company has a much larger deductible on their insurance program, they may have a lower insurance cost, but they're taking more risk. Neither one is right nor wrong, but they're just different strategies that will affect your margin.<br/>Secondly, margin is affected by what you include at a store level cost and what you include at G&amp;A level cost. So I wouldn't look at -- compare our margin to our largest peers and assume that it's an apples-to-apples comparison. But I really appreciate your question, which is, do we think there are additional synergies in the overall portfolio that aren't in the underwritten number that we've given? And it's absolutely true. I mean, just things like densification, right? <br/>If we now have a district manager, our district managers cover about 17 stores. And because of our portfolio footprint there, have 8 stores in 1 city and 10 stores and another, that's inefficient. It has travel costs and other negative impacts. But as we get more and more stores and those footprints of the district managers get smaller: one, they can take on more stores, which reduces the number of district managers we need; and second of all, just become more efficient in their coverage of those stores. So there's a lot of those types of synergies that we absolutely expect to achieve that are not in any of our numbers. <br/>The other thing is the testing with running a second brand and whether the revenue uplift from the second brand will more than cover the cost of maintaining a second brand, and we're hopeful and optimistic that we are going to figure that one out as well.",
			"<strong>Ki Bin Kim</strong>",
			"And, Joe, you talked about the benefit of having more data, but there's obviously a diminishing return to that because this 50% more data doesn't mean you're 50% more better. So can you just talk a little bit more about that and what the upside looks like from a more tangible standpoint?",
			"<strong>Joseph Daniel Margolis</strong>",
			"So if you went and talk to our data scientists, I'm not sure they'd agree with that. They can't get enough data. But yes, I mean, I think, logically, you're right. It's not 1:1, but it's certain -- there certainly is a benefit, from nothing else in just the speed in which you can get statistically significant results, right? We can run tests faster and then implement whatever the optimized solution is quicker because with more data in a bigger pool, you get this statistical significance quicker.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley.",
			"<strong>Ronald Kamdem</strong>",
			"Just 2 quick ones for me. So 1 is on the -- just going back to the tenants that are coming through some of the online or the mobile, just after a couple of years, a couple of quarters from COVID now, any sort of learnings in terms of how they're behaving versus sort of tenants that are coming into the store? Is it the same? Is there sort of any noticeable difference?",
			"<strong>Joseph Daniel Margolis</strong>",
			"So we've always observed differences of tenant behavior, depending on what channel they come through, both in terms of what's an effective tool to capture that tenant and what their behavior is in terms of unit size, length of stay, other factors. And we're constantly refining the differences in our different channels that is the results of those learnings.",
			"<strong>Ronald Kamdem</strong>",
			"Great. And then the -- just going back to the expenses, the property tax being negative. I know you touched on it, but can you give a little bit more color sort of what happened there on the negative growth on the property taxes?",
			"<strong>P. Scott Stubbs</strong>",
			"That's primarily appeals that we won during the quarter then revised numbers going forward. So it really relates primarily to prior periods as you win those appeals from prior periods.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller from JPMorgan.",
			"<strong>Michael William Mueller</strong>",
			"I guess a couple of questions. First of all, going forward, should we think of the bridge loan program and balances as kind of going up and down based on acquisition opportunities? Or should we really be thinking about that business as being completely independent regardless of what you're thinking about the acquisition markets?",
			"<strong>Joseph Daniel Margolis</strong>",
			"I think the latter. I think our capital position is such one that we can fund bridge loans that we feel are good deals and do so in a capital-light manner because we can sell the A notes and not restrict ourselves from good acquisition opportunities because we're making bridge loans and vice versa.",
			"<strong>Michael William Mueller</strong>",
			"Got it. Okay. And second question, I apologize if it was discussed before. But part of Scott's comments, I think, were a little garbled at least on my end. But can you touch on the percentage of customers that have been in place over a year and over 2 years? And if you're seeing any degradation in that ratio?",
			"<strong>P. Scott Stubbs</strong>",
			"Yes. So if you look at our customers that have been with us for more than 2 years, that number is now in the upper 40s, about 47%. Customers that have been with us 12 to 18 months, that's in the low 60s. That number has actually come down some. So long-term customers, beyond 2 years, is increasing, that midterm customer has actually come down a little bit.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Joe Margolis for any further remarks.",
			"<strong>Joseph Daniel Margolis</strong>",
			"Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for your time and your interest. I want to thank the LSI team for their great cooperation, professionalism and efforts over the past many weeks. I've been very impressed with every individual we have interacted with, how they've handled themselves, and I'm very grateful. <br/>I also want to assure our shareholders that while we are spending a lot of time preparing for this merger and it's time consuming and a significant effort, everyone at Extra Space Storage remains focused on the fundamentals of our business, which is driving performance in our stores. Thank you very much. I hope everyone has a good day.",

(Operator Instructions) <br/>At this time, I'll turn the call over to Joe.",
			"<strong>Joseph V. Saffire</strong>",
			"Thanks, Brent, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report we delivered another strong quarterly performance across all segments of our business. While we continue to see the operating environment normalize as compared to the height of the pandemic, occupancy and asking rates remain above pre-pandemic levels. <br/>I'd like to highlight a few notable results and trends. We achieved same-store revenue and net operating income growth of 10.5% and 12.8%, respectively, despite challenging year-over-year comparison. This marks the eighth straight quarter of double-digit same-store revenue and net operating income growth.<br/>As the environment normalizes, our solid performance has remained broad-based with 25 of our top 2040 markets achieving 9% or greater revenue growth. These results highlight the value of our portfolio strategy over the past few years, which has allowed us to capitalize on strong regional trends. <br/>Move-ins for the quarter finished up 1.1%, with April accelerating nearly 3% over March. Our customer base continues to show resilience with 49% of our customers having stayed with us 2 years or more. That is up 210 basis points from this time last year. Recent trends and a resilient customer base keep us cautiously optimistic as we head into the peak leasing season. <br/>For the quarter, we completed one joint venture acquisition in New Jersey, in which we invested $4.1 million. Subsequent to the quarter end, we invested $15.1 million in 4 additional stores in the New York City area with a joint venture partner. These acquisitions are highly complementary with our current portfolio and our future upside with moderate capital investment. <br/>Before I hand the call over to Alex, I want to provide a brief perspective on the merger with Extra Space Storage which was announced on April 3 and which we expect to close in the second half of the year. <br/>First, I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation to the entire Life Storage team. I am very proud of what we have all achieved together and I'm incredibly excited about the opportunities ahead. We are focused on working with Extra Space team to complete the merger and capitalize on the significant potential of our combined platform. <br/>And with that, I will hand the call over to Alex, who will provide additional color on our performance for the quarter.",
			"<strong>Alexander E. Gress</strong>",
			"Thanks, Joe. Last night, we reported quarterly adjusted funds from operations of $1.63 per share for the first quarter, an increase of 13.2% over the same quarter last year, and above the high end of our guidance. The strong adjusted FFO performance was a result of robust same-store results and acquisition performance. <br/>First quarter same-store revenue increased 10.5% over the first quarter of 2022, primarily driven by a 13.6% growth and achieved rates over last year. As no surprise, the operating environment continues to normalize and level off from its highs with same-store occupancy averaging 90.7% during the quarter but remaining 80 basis points above pre-pandemic levels. We remain cautiously optimistic as we enter peak leasing season with asking rates and move-ins heading in the right direction. <br/>Our same-store operating expenses grew only 5.2% for the quarter versus the prior year primarily driven by real estate taxes, credit card fees and payroll and benefits. The net effect of that same-store revenue and expense performance was a 140 basis point expansion and quarterly same-store net operating income margin to 71.5%, resulting in year-over-year growth in same-store NOI of 12.8% for the first quarter. As Joe noted, this marks our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit same-store NOI growth. <br/>Turning to the balance sheet. Our net debt to recurring EBITDA ratio is a comfortable 4.9x at quarter end, which is up very slightly from 4.8x at the previous quarter end. Our debt service coverage is at a very healthy 5.2x as of March 31. We continue to have no significant debt maturities until April 2024, when $175 million becomes due, with our average debt maturity of 5.3 years and our weighted average rate is 3.7% at quarter end. In addition, as of March 31, 82% of our debt was fixed rate. <br/>Details of our 2023 earnings guidance and related assumptions were included in our release last night. Our forward guidance for the year remains consistent with the guidance we provided late February. <br/>(Operator Instructions) We will not be providing additional commentary regarding the pending transaction with Extra Space. <br/>With that, operator, please open the call for questions.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) Your first question is coming from Spenser Allaway of Green Street.",
			"<strong>Spenser Bowes Allaway</strong>",
			"As noted in your opening remarks, you had really impressive rental rate growth in the quarter. Can you just help us understand how move-in rates and ECRIs trended in 1Q to arrive at that 13.6%? And then any color you can provide on how those 2 metrics trended through April would be helpful?",
			"<strong>Alexander E. Gress</strong>",
			"Sure, Spenser. It's Alex. Consistent with Joe's opening comments, just to give a macro view on the quarter. It's kind of what we said, the operating environment continue to normalize. And as we get into March, April, we're definitely seeing early indications of increasing and stronger seasonal trends. <br/>But to talk about some specifics. Q1 from the move-in side was -- it's certainly an interesting quarter. Overall, we were up on record move-ins 1.1% for the quarter, but it was almost a tale of 2 worlds. I mean, very strong January. And then consistent with what you heard from the other REITs, it's certainly move-in volume slowed down in February and March. <br/>Now we still had a record quarter, but we saw that slowdown in February, March. Now that shifted and changed and move-ins as expected, certainly began to accelerate and we saw that in April, and that trend continues into -- we're only a couple of days into May, but that -- what I said that early strength of seasonal trends continues. So move-ins accelerating from March to April accelerated up 3%. So that's the trend there. <br/>Move-outs overall for the first quarter pretty much what we expected. I mean they were up in totality for the quarter, about 7%, a little higher. Very similar theme. A little higher in January and February, then March for everybody just seemed to be very quiet. The backdrop being theoretical crisis in the banking world and March just being a challenging month from an economic perspective. So March just seemed flat. <br/>As we look at move-outs going from March to April and what we saw in April, move-outs are actually going down. They're down 4.5% month-over-month, comparing March to April. So that's exactly what we expected. So early signs are strong.",
			"<strong>Joseph V. Saffire</strong>",
			"Yes. Spenser, it's Joe. I would just add, you asked about the ECRIs as well, and we obviously were pretty much on target with what we expected to do for the year. We typically try to get most of them done in the first half of the year, and we're on track with that and feel good about the results. And obviously, the move-outs, we're pleasantly surprised and pleased with what we're seeing so far despite the ECRI program.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question is coming from Ki Bin Kim from Truist Securities.",
			"<strong>Ki Bin Kim</strong>",
			"So Joe, I just wanted to clarify the comments you made about achieved rates. Were you saying that the move-in rates were up 13-plus percent year-over-year in the first quarter?",
			"<strong>Alexander E. Gress</strong>",
			"No, Ki Bin, let me clarify. What was up 13.6% in the first quarter of this year '23 were our achieved rates. That's what our customers are paying, and that was up 13.6%. Now what drives that? Obviously, that's a lot of the rate growth from our ECRI program.",
			"<strong>Joseph V. Saffire</strong>",
			"Yes, the actual asking rate, street rates, Ki Bin, were down for the quarter, about 14%.",
			"<strong>Ki Bin Kim</strong>",
			"And how did that trend into April, please?",
			"<strong>Joseph V. Saffire</strong>",
			"April, actually slightly up 2% from March. But year-over-year, still down about 14%, 15% range.",
			"<strong>Alexander E. Gress</strong>",
			"Yes. And I'd just add to that. We expect that, right? Because think about the path of street rates for all of us last year. That's a really tough, tough comparison on a year-over-year basis. So while we're down in that mid-teens on an asking rate or street rate perspective, even in April, what Joe commented on to add on is we're seeing that, what we expect. Street rates are increasing as we get into peak leasing season.",
			"<strong>Joseph V. Saffire</strong>",
			"Yes. And we're seeing some nice indications. It's early in May, but we're seeing some nice month-to-month continued growth in street rates to pick up another 2% or so. So that's what we expect for the peak leasing season.",
			"<strong>Ki Bin Kim</strong>",
			"Okay. That makes a lot more sense. And my second question, you guys have obviously, seems to be bucking the trend here compared to some of your peers that showed more deceleration. So I was just curious, high level, any kind of incremental changes you guys made to your pricing philosophies? Or do you see a bigger contribution from ECRI in this quarter than previous quarters? I'm just trying to get a sense of like what makes -- what contributed to your differences?",
			"<strong>Joseph V. Saffire</strong>",
			"No. I think, to be honest, since last year, we decided to maximize revenue and not necessarily occupancy, and pretty much the same strategy for the first -- for the first start of this year as well. But no real changes. Similar levels of ECRIs as last year, similar percentages and pretty much as we had planned.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question is coming from Michael Goldsmith of UBS.",
			"<strong>Michael Goldsmith</strong>",
			"Guys, did you see any price sensitivity of the customer during the quarter? Clearly, right, there was a bit of a slowdown in March. Do you think that was a result of price sensitivity? And did you adjust your prices kind of -- your street rates through the quarter. And then similarly on the ECRI side, you clearly do some testing. So is the -- in trying to get a sense of, is the self-storage customer more price-sensitive now than they have been in the past?",
			"<strong>Joseph V. Saffire</strong>",
			"Michael, obviously, we do a lot of testing, especially with ECRIs. We've continued to improve that strategy. As I said in my opening -- looking at the first question, pleasantly surprised with move-outs being down year-over-year in April, which is a nice thing to see. It shows our customers are sticky. They can take the rate increases. And I think, again, we're just kind of getting back to some normalization and seasonality. <br/>Obviously, for the demand, looks like it's holding up pretty well, like what we see coming into May. And obviously, we adjust our street rates accordingly, promotions and so forth. But nothing unusual right now. We're pretty pleased with what we're seeing.",
			"<strong>Alexander E. Gress</strong>",
			"Yes. And I'll just really briefly add to Joe's comments, Michael. Yes, I mean, for us, our customer retention continues to be really positive. So we're currently at 39.7 months for customer retention, and that's certainly higher than what we saw in 2019 or earlier levels, where it was about 37.5 months. <br/>As we've talked about in the past, and we certainly did not see an impact in the quarter. To add more data to your question, 64% of our customers stay 1 year or more, and that's up from the past. And 49% are staying 2 years or more. So we think those are really good indications of the resilience and stickiness of the self-storage customer for us and likely the entire space.",
			"<strong>Michael Goldsmith</strong>",
			"That's helpful. And my second question has to do with the slowdown in February and March. What do you think caused that? And then also, did you take any actions as a result of that or adjust your strategy in order to kind of invigorate demand back in April? Did you cut street rate? Did you hold back on ECRIs at all, just given that the demand wasn't there? Just trying to get a sense of your thought process around it, around what happened. And then also what actions you took which may have rectified kind of the slower demand?",
			"<strong>Joseph V. Saffire</strong>",
			"Yes. I mean, obviously, February -- January, February, March, slow part of the year. No knee-jerk reactions. Obviously, we're -- we've got to stay competitive in pricing, follow street rates, look at competition. We do a lot of scraping. But obviously, no, we didn't go crazy on promotions. Again, kind of gearing up for the peak lease -- peak leasing season, which I think is upon us. <br/>But nothing unusual, Michael. I think we are kind of pleased with what we're seeing so far. And kind of expected, given what's going on in the economy and housing that may be up and down a little bit, but nothing that's worrying us right now.",
			"<strong>Alexander E. Gress</strong>",
			"Yes. As we kind of said earlier, Michael, I mean, we know March was kind of a challenging month for the environment, given the backdrop of what was happening outside the storage space. So I think a lot of people saw just general slowness in March. <br/>But to be specific, we stuck to our ECRI program. We continued on that program, and you certainly saw that in our same-store rev growth that we put up for the first quarter. We expected move-outs to accelerate in Q1 as we pushed on rates, and we did. It was interesting to see that it was flat in March, and I just think that shows that everything kind of slowed down a little bit in March, move-ins and move-outs.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question is coming from Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital Markets.",
			"<strong>Unidentified Analyst</strong>",
			"[Robin Hanlon] sitting in for Juan. On geography, are you seeing any softness across any markets that had previously had housing markets and that are not cooling a bit?",
			"<strong>Joseph V. Saffire</strong>",
			"Well, actually, we've been pretty bullish on the Sunbelt markets. And I think we're seeing some separation from those markets compared to some of the other markets, such as the Northeast. So the Phoenix, Florida's West Coast, again, doing very, very well for us, kind of separate themselves a bit from some of the other markets such as the Northeast. But nothing too significant.",
			"<strong>Unidentified Analyst</strong>",
			"Got it. Also as a follow-up, Extra Space tends to run occupancy above 300 basis points higher with higher rates. Has this influenced your operating strategy any? And what's the path to bridge the gap?",
			"<strong>Joseph V. Saffire</strong>",
			"Again, we focus on maximizing revenue, and it's been our strategy for a while, and we don't focus on purely occupancy. We don't expect that to change.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) Your next question is coming from Samir Khanal from Evercore ISI.",
			"<strong>Samir Upadhyay Khanal</strong>",
			"Joe or Alex, just curious. When I look at some of your markets, right, Atlanta, Vegas, Phoenix, I mean, occupancy drops were -- I think it was like 400 bps or so year-over-year. Is there a common theme you're seeing across these markets? I know things are normalizing, I get that. But is it housing? Is it supply? I just wanted to see if there's anything that we can pick up from those sort of occupancy drops?",
			"<strong>Alexander E. Gress</strong>",
			"Yes. Samir, it's Alex. Obviously, we really like the Sun Belt market, I mean that's obviously where we've invested in. And I think the we continue to expect relative outperformance there. But yes, a little softening in the quarter in Vegas and Phoenix, to call them out. Obviously, we know parts -- some parts of Northeast where that expects to happen. But we did see maybe just a touch more -- as expected, saw some supply maybe specifically coming into Vegas and Phoenix that may be part of that there. But nothing unusual, and we like that market.",
			"<strong>Samir Upadhyay Khanal</strong>",
			"Got it. And anything on the -- I guess, as a follow-up, anything on the expense side that's there to call out that's maybe -- are there any line items or components that are maybe coming in a little bit higher than you sort of budgeted for the year as we think about the balance of the year? Any pressures to the upside you're seeing?",
			"<strong>Alexander E. Gress</strong>",
			"No. I mean, first of all, you could see that our expenses came in very much in line with our guidance. So absolutely nothing unusual. Obviously, we're facing transaction-related expenses that are not impacting our core FFO, which are taken below the line as everyone would expect us to. So -- but outside of that, no, very much in line with our guidance that we set out in February, and reaffirmed last night.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question is coming from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets.",
			"<strong>Todd Michael Thomas</strong>",
			"I guess 2 questions. First, I just wanted to see if you could comment on occupancy. Sorry if I missed this, but quarter end was down about 30 basis points from the quarter average, and I was just curious if that was anticipated. And if you could comment on April and how occupancies trended a little bit more recently through the early part of the peak rental season?",
			"<strong>Alexander E. Gress</strong>",
			"Todd. Yes, it's Alex. No, I mean very much -- yes, we expect through the course of Q1 that occupancy was going to come down a little bit as we pushed on rates and expected those move-outs and then March happened to be flat. So not surprised there, and Joe's comments earlier, that's really not our prime, prime focus as we think about more optimizing revenue. <br/>But as we get into April and the environment continues to normalize, and more specifically, we see that strengthening seasonal trends start to pick up, and we know that May and June will be strong months, we expect there would be a continued upward slope in occupancy that will go up through Q2. And that's kind of consistent with where we've set our guidance. And -- but we'll see how May and June kind of play out.",
			"<strong>Todd Michael Thomas</strong>",
			"Okay. And then I wanted to ask about guidance. I realize you're under a merger agreement with Extra Space that's pending here. So I don't know if that had an impact, but you guided originally for the first quarter to $155 million to $159 million. So you came in a few pennies, $0.04 above the high end of that range despite sort of the slowdown in February and March that you discussed. <br/>And I was just curious if you could comment about the quarter itself relative to budget and sort of provide a little bit of additional commentary around the balance of the full year as it pertains to your outlook or original guidance?",
			"<strong>Joseph V. Saffire</strong>",
			"Yes. Thanks, Todd. Yes, obviously, we're very pleased with the quarter results. Pleased with what we're seeing in early, I would say, last week or so in terms of rate and move-in volume activity. <br/>I would say we want to see what's going on with the peak leasing season over the next few months and then make a judgment with regard to guidance after that. But right now, I think we felt comfortable sticking with what we have out there, feel good about what we have and feel we should be able to achieve that. But obviously, would make some adjustments as the year progresses into the summer.",
			"<strong>Todd Michael Thomas</strong>",
			"Okay. But relative to the first quarter guidance, whether same-store or otherwise, I guess, what were sort of the main positive variances that drove you $0.05, $0.06 above the midpoint of the range that you guided to?",
			"<strong>Alexander E. Gress</strong>",
			"Yes. I'll get a little more specific relative to budget in Q1. Obviously, it is -- it's clearly a beat in Q1. And -- but not, again, a couple of pennies, so not far outside of our guidance. And I think on the expense side, as I said earlier, very much in line with budget. I think we were very pleased. Even though March was flat, we said move in and move out. Going back to the comments we said a few minutes ago, the self-storage consumer remains very resilient and sticky, and the ability to absorb ECRI, those rate increases, very much remains. <br/>And so a little bit higher than what we had certainly thought, but in a good way, was that 13.6% year-over-year growth and achieved rates which gave us a little bit more of a beat to the upside coming out of our same-store pool. <br/>And then I would say, secondly, the acquisitions that are not in our same-store pool continuing to perform consistent with, if not slightly above, our underwriting assumptions. So a combination of those factors probably give us a little bit more of a beat relative to the Q1 budget.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question is coming from Keegan Carl of Wolfe Research.",
			"<strong>Keegan Grant Carl</strong>",
			"Apologies if I missed this, but I mean how should we be thinking about your marketing spend going forward, just kind of given what you're seeing in your demand funnel?",
			"<strong>Alexander E. Gress</strong>",
			"Yes. Maybe I'll go first, and Joe can comment. Obviously, for us, when you look at our marketing spend on our same-store pool, it came in, on the advertising, very much in line with what we expect, just north of that 4%. And I think we're continuing to see pretty good website traffic growth. And the challenge continues to remain for us and everybody, the conversion of that traffic growth into true reservations. <br/>But if I look at just doing simple math, which is kind of the way -- one of the ways we look at it, the cost per move-in for us was only up year-over-year 1.7%, so sub-2% for every move-in that we achieved in the first quarter. So I like that -- so we like that trade because we've commented earlier on the stickiness, the resilience of our customer base. And so I think that's the path, and we expect that to continue to be on those levels as we think about the rest of the year.",
			"<strong>Keegan Grant Carl</strong>",
			"Okay. And then I guess from a transaction side of things, I guess, first, what are you sort of seeing volume-wise in the market and where you're seeing cap rates at? And then on the JV acquisitions you did in the quarter and subsequent to quarter end, what are your expected stabilized yields on those?",
			"<strong>Joseph V. Saffire</strong>",
			"Yes, Keegan, obviously, the market is a bit of a penciled down right now. The bid-ask spread is pretty wide. So we see some more stability in the debt markets and specifically the 10-year, I think you're not going to see so many transactions. Our guidance kind of anticipated the bulk of any deals would be in the second half of the year, and we still feel that's the case. The JVs -- trying to think exactly, the New York City portfolio, those are mature assets with some -- I think, some decent upside in terms of management, but probably about a 6%, 6.5% stabilized yield.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Thank you very much. At this time, there are no more questions. I'm now going to turn it over to Joe for any closing remarks.",
			"<strong>Joseph V. Saffire</strong>",
			"So thanks, everybody, for joining today's call. I hope you have a good day, and we'll talk soon. Thank you.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Thank you, everybody. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation."

Our calculation includes all adjustments consistent with the requirements to present Adjusted EBITDAre on a pro forma basis in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. Annualized Pro Forma Adjustments are consistent with the debt service coverage ratio calculated under financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes. The following table summarizes our Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDAre calculation for the period indicated below:",
			" ",
			"<b>GLOSSARY</b>",
			"<b>Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i></b>. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (Nareit) established an EBITDA metric for real estate companies (i.e., EBITDA for real estate, or EBITDA<i>re</i>) it believed would provide investors with a consistent measure to help make investment decisions among certain REITs. Our definition of \"Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i>\" is generally consistent with the Nareit definition, other than our adjustment to remove foreign currency and derivative gain and loss, excluding the gain and loss from the settlement of foreign currency forwards not designated as hedges (which is consistent with our previous calculations of \"Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i>\"). We define Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i>, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the most recent quarter as earnings (net income) before (i) interest expense, including non-cash loss (gain) on swaps, (ii) income and franchise taxes, (iii) real estate depreciation and amortization, (iv) provisions for impairment, (v) merger and integration-related costs, (vi) gain on sales of real estate, (vii) foreign currency and derivative gain and loss, net, and (viii) our proportionate share of interest expense and real estate depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated entities. Our Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> reported by other companies or as defined by Nareit, and other companies may interpret or define Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> differently than we do. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> to be a meaningful measure of a REIT's performance because it provides a view of our operating performance, analyzes our ability to meet interest payment obligations before the effects of income tax, depreciation and amortization expense, provisions for impairment, gain on sales of real estate and other items, as defined above, that affect comparability, including the removal of non-recurring and non-cash items that industry observers believe are less relevant to evaluating the operating performance of a company. In addition, EBITDA<i>re</i> is widely followed by industry analysts, lenders, investors, rating agencies, and others as a means of evaluating the operational cash generating capacity of a company prior to servicing debt obligations. Management also believes the use of an annualized quarterly Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> metric is meaningful because it represents our current earnings run rate for the period presented. The ratio of our total debt to our annualized quarterly Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> is also used to determine vesting of performance share awards granted to our executive officers. Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income as a measure of our operating performance.",
			"<b>Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO),</b> a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as FFO adjusted for unique revenue and expense items, which we believe are not as pertinent to the measurement of our ongoing operating performance. Most companies in our industry use a similar measurement to AFFO, but they may use the term \"CAD\" (for Cash Available for Distribution) or \"FAD\" (for Funds Available for Distribution). We believe AFFO provides useful information to investors because it is a widely accepted industry measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that is used by industry analysts and investors who look at and compare those companies. In particular, AFFO provides an additional measure to compare the operating performance of different REITs without having to account for differing depreciation assumptions and other unique revenue and expense items which are not pertinent to measuring a particular company's ongoing operating performance. Therefore, we believe that AFFO is an appropriate supplemental performance metric, and that the most appropriate GAAP performance metric to which AFFO should be reconciled is net income available to common stockholders.",

			"<b>Annualized Contractual Rent </b>is the monthly aggregate cash amount charged to clients, inclusive of monthly base rent receivables, as of the balance sheet date, multiplied by 12, excluding percentage rent. We believe annualized contractual rent is a useful supplemental operating measure, as it excludes properties that were no longer owned at the balance sheet date and includes the annualized rent from properties acquired during the quarter. Annualized contractual rent has not been reduced to reflect reserves recorded as reductions to GAAP rental revenue in the periods presented. Annualized contractual rent excludes unconsolidated entities.",
			"<b>Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDAre, </b>a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as Adjusted EBITDAre, which includes transaction accounting adjustments in accordance with U.S. GAAP, consists of adjustments to incorporate Adjusted EBITDAre from properties we acquired or stabilized during the applicable quarter and removes Adjusted EBITDAre from properties we disposed of during the applicable quarter, giving pro forma effect to all transactions as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable quarter. Our calculation includes all adjustments consistent with the requirements to present Adjusted EBITDAre on a pro forma basis in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. The annualized pro forma adjustments are consistent with the debt service coverage ratio calculated under financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes and bonds.",
			"<b>Funds From Operations (FFO), </b>a non-GAAP financial measure, consistent with the Nareit definition, is net income available to common stockholders, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, plus provisions for impairments of depreciable real estate assets, and reduced by gain on property sales. Presentation of the information regarding FFO and AFFO is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO and AFFO in the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. FFO and AFFO should not be considered alternatives to reviewing our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities. In addition, FFO and AFFO should not be considered measures of liquidity, of our ability to make cash distributions, or of our ability to pay interest payments. We consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a REIT's operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that adds back items such as depreciation and impairments for FFO. The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation could be less informative. The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. In addition, FFO is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility.",
			"<b>Initial Weighted Average Cash Lease Yield</b> (acquisitions) is computed as contractual cash net operating income for the first twelve months following the acquisition date, divided by the total cost of the property (including all expenses borne by us).",
			"<b>Investment Grade Clients</b> are our clients with a credit rating, and our clients that are subsidiaries or affiliates of companies with a credit rating, as of the balance sheet date, of Baa3/BBB- or higher from one of the three major rating agencies (Moody's/S&amp;P/Fitch).",
			"<b>Net Debt/Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre</b>, a ratio used by management as a measure of leverage, is calculated as net debt (which we define as total debt per our consolidated balance sheet, excluding deferred financing costs and net premiums and discounts, less cash and cash equivalents), divided by Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre.",
			"<b>Net Debt/Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDAre</b>, a ratio used by management as a measure of leverage, is calculated as net debt (which we define as total debt per our consolidated balance sheet, excluding deferred financing costs and net premiums and discounts, less cash and cash equivalents), divided by Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDAre.",
			"<b>Normalized Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (Normalized FFO)</b>, a non-GAAP financial measure, is FFO excluding merger and integration-related costs associated with our merger with VEREIT.",
			"<b>Same Store Pool</b>, for purposes of determining the properties used to calculate our same store rental revenue, includes all properties that we owned for the entire year-to-date period, for both the current and prior year except for properties during the current or prior year that were: (i) vacant at any time,(ii) under development or redevelopment, or (iii) involved in eminent domain and rent was reduced.",
			"<b>Same Store Rental Revenue</b> excludes straight-line rent, the amortization of above-and below-market leases, and reimbursements from clients for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses. For purposes of comparability, same store rental revenue is presented on a constant currency basis by applying the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date to base currency rental revenue.",

			"<em>\"We had a strong start to the year, delivering nearly $2 billion of revenue for the quarter, as our outlook remains positive with the overall demand for digital transformation fueling our conviction around the long-term secular drivers of our business. We look forward to our upcoming analyst day next month, where we plan to continue the discussion of the significant opportunity ahead and our strongly differentiated position in capturing this opportunity as we enable our customers to access all the right places, partners and possibilities.\"</em>",
			"<strong><ins>Business Highlights</ins></strong>",
			"<strong><ins>Business Outlook</ins></strong>",
			"For the second quarter of 2023, the Company expects revenues to range between $1.995 and $2.025 billion, an increase of approximately 0 - 1% over the previous quarter, or a normalized and constant currency increase of 0 - 2%. This guidance includes a negative $10 million foreign currency impact when compared to the average FX rates in Q1 2023 and lower non-recurring revenues. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $881 and $911 million. Adjusted EBITDA reflects the impact of increased seasonal energy costs and the expected expiration of prior power cost commitments, and a negative $5 million foreign currency impact when compared to the average FX rates in Q1 2023. For the quarter, integration costs from acquisitions are expected to be $5 million. Recurring capital expenditures are expected to range between $35 and $45 million.",
			"For the full year of 2023, total revenues are expected to range between $8.175 and $8.275 billion, a 13 - 14% increase over the previous year, or a normalized and constant currency increase of 14 - 15%. This $30 million increase from previously issued guidance is due to a foreign currency benefit when compared to the prior guidance rates. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $3.635 and $3.715 billion, an adjusted EBITDA margin of 45%. This $20 million increase from previously issued guidance is primarily due to a $13 million foreign currency benefit when compared to prior guidance rates, $5 million of better-than-expected operating performance and a $2 million reduction of integration costs. AFFO is expected to range between $2.927 and $3.007 billion, an increase of 8 - 11% over the previous year, or a normalized and constant currency increase of 10 - 13%. This $44 million increase from previously issued guidance is due to $32 million of better-than-expected business performance, a $2 million reduction of integration costs and a $10 million foreign currency benefit when compared to prior guidance rates. AFFO per share is expected to range between $31.15 and $32.00, an increase of 5 - 8% over the previous year, or a normalized and constant currency increase of 8 - 11%. Total capital expenditures are expected to range between $2.708 and $2.958 billion. Non-recurring capital expenditures, including xScale-related capital expenditures, are expected to range between $2.510 and $2.740 billion, and recurring capital expenditures are expected to range between $198 and $218 million. xScale-related on-balance sheet capital expenditures are expected to range between $131 and $181 million, which we anticipate will be reimbursed to Equinix from both the current and future xScale JVs.",
			"The U.S. dollar exchange rates used for 2023 guidance, taking into consideration the impact of our current foreign currency hedges, have been updated to $1.09 to the Euro, $1.19 to the Pound, S$1.33 to the U.S. Dollar, ¥133 to the U.S. Dollar, A$1.50 to the U.S. Dollar, HK$7.85 to the U.S. Dollar, R$5.08 to the U.S. Dollar and C$1.35 to the U.S. Dollar. The Q1 2023 global revenue breakdown by currency for the Euro, British Pound, Singapore Dollar, Japanese Yen, Australian Dollar, Hong Kong Dollar, Brazilian Real and Canadian Dollar is 20%, 9%, 8%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 3% and 2%, respectively.",
			"The adjusted EBITDA guidance is based on the revenue guidance less our expectations of cash cost of revenues and cash operating expenses. The AFFO guidance is based on the adjusted EBITDA guidance less our expectations of net interest expense, an installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent expense adjustment, a contract cost adjustment, amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums, income tax expense, an income tax expense adjustment, recurring capital expenditures, other income (expense), (gains) losses on disposition of real estate property, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-controlling interests' share of these items.",

Equinix enables today's businesses to access all the right places, partners and possibilities they need to accelerate advantage. With Equinix, they can scale with agility, speed the launch of digital services, deliver world-class experiences and multiply their value.",
			"<strong><ins>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</ins></strong>",
			"Equinix provides all information required in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), but it believes that evaluating its ongoing operating results may be difficult if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, Equinix uses non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its operations.",
			"Equinix provides normalized and constant currency growth rates, which are calculated to adjust for acquisitions, dispositions, integration costs, changes in accounting principles and foreign currency.",
			"Equinix presents adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income excluding income tax expense, interest income, interest expense, other income or expense, gain or loss on debt extinguishment, depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs and gain or loss on asset sales.",
			"In presenting non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA, cash cost of revenues, cash gross margins, cash operating expenses (also known as cash selling, general and administrative expenses or cash SG&amp;A), adjusted EBITDA margins, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow, Equinix excludes certain items that it believes are not good indicators of Equinix's current or future operating performance. These items are depreciation, amortization, accretion of asset retirement obligations and accrued restructuring charges, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs and gain or loss on asset sales. Equinix excludes these items in order for its lenders, investors and the industry analysts who review and report on Equinix to better evaluate Equinix's operating performance and cash spending levels relative to its industry sector and competitors.",
			"Equinix excludes depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of a data center, and do not reflect its current or future cash spending levels to support its business. Its data centers are long-lived assets, and have an economic life greater than 10 years. The construction costs of a data center do not recur with respect to such data center, although Equinix may incur initial construction costs in future periods with respect to additional data centers, and future capital expenditures remain minor relative to the initial investment. This is a trend it expects to continue. In addition, depreciation is also based on the estimated useful lives of the data centers. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historic costs incurred to build out our data centers and are not indicative of current or expected future capital expenditures. Therefore, Equinix excludes depreciation from its operating results when evaluating its operations.",
			"In addition, in presenting the non-GAAP financial measures, Equinix also excludes amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets. Amortization expense is significantly affected by the timing and magnitude of acquisitions, and these charges may vary in amount from period to period. We exclude amortization expense to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our prior periods. Equinix excludes accretion expense, both as it relates to its asset retirement obligations as well as its accrued restructuring charges, as these expenses represent costs which Equinix also believes are not meaningful in evaluating Equinix's current operations. Equinix excludes stock-based compensation expense, as it can vary significantly from period to period based on share price and the timing, size and nature of equity awards. As such, Equinix and many investors and analysts exclude stock-based compensation expense to compare its operating results with those of other companies. Equinix excludes restructuring charges from its non-GAAP financial measures. The restructuring charges relate to Equinix's decision to exit leases for excess space adjacent to several of its IBX® data centers, which it did not intend to build out, or its decision to reverse such restructuring charges. Equinix also excludes impairment charges generally related to certain long-lived assets. The impairment charges are related to expense recognized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets are not recoverable. Equinix also excludes gain or loss on asset sales as it represents profit or loss that is not meaningful in evaluating the current or future operating performance. Finally, Equinix excludes transaction costs from its non-GAAP financial measures to allow more comparable comparisons of the financial results to the historical operations. The transaction costs relate to costs Equinix incurs in connection with business combinations and formation of joint ventures, including advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other professional or consulting fees. Such charges generally are not relevant to assessing the long-term performance of Equinix. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the transactions. Management believes items such as restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs and gain or loss on asset sales are non-core transactions; however, these types of costs may occur in future periods.",
			"Equinix also presents funds from operations (\"FFO\") and adjusted funds from operations (\"AFFO\"), both commonly used in the REIT industry, as supplemental performance measures. Additionally, Equinix presents AFFO per share, which is also commonly used in the REIT industry. AFFO per share offers investors and industry analysts a perspective of Equinix's underlying operating performance when compared to other REIT companies. FFO is calculated in accordance with the definition established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). FFO represents net income or loss, excluding gain or loss from the disposition of real estate assets, depreciation and amortization on real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-controlling interests' share of these items. AFFO represents FFO, excluding depreciation and amortization expense on non-real estate assets, accretion, stock-based compensation, stock-based charitable contributions, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs, an installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent expense adjustment, a contract cost adjustment, amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums, gain or loss on debt extinguishment, an income tax expense adjustment, recurring capital expenditures, net income or loss from discontinued operations, net of tax and adjustments from FFO to AFFO for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-controlling interests' share of these items. Equinix excludes depreciation expense, amortization expense, accretion, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges and transaction costs for the same reasons that they are excluded from the other non-GAAP financial measures mentioned above.",
			"Equinix includes an adjustment for revenues from installation fees, since installation fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of contract term, although the fees are generally paid in a lump sum upon installation. Equinix includes an adjustment for straight-line rent expense on its operating leases, since the total minimum lease payments are recognized ratably over the lease term, although the lease payments generally increase over the lease term. Equinix also includes an adjustment to contract costs incurred to obtain contracts, since contract costs are capitalized and amortized over the estimated period of benefit on a straight-line basis, although costs of obtaining contracts are generally incurred and paid during the period of obtaining the contracts. The adjustments for installation revenues, straight-line rent expense and contract costs are intended to isolate the cash activity included within the straight-lined or amortized results in the consolidated statement of operations. Equinix excludes the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums as these expenses relate to the initial costs incurred in connection with its debt financings that have no current or future cash obligations. Equinix excludes gain or loss on debt extinguishment since it represents a cost that is not a good indicator of Equinix's current or future operating performance. Equinix includes an income tax expense adjustment, which represents the non-cash tax impact due to changes in valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions that do not relate to the current period's operations. Equinix excludes recurring capital expenditures, which represent expenditures to extend the useful life of its IBX and xScale data centers or other assets that are required to support current revenues. Equinix also excludes net income or loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, which represents results that are not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance.",
			"Equinix presents constant currency results of operations, which is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP results of operations. However, Equinix has presented this non-GAAP financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate its operating results without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of Equinix's business performance. To present this information, Equinix's current and comparative prior period revenues and certain operating expenses from entities with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at a consistent exchange rate for purposes of each result being compared.",
			"Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, but should be considered together with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Equinix presents such non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate its operating results in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be its core, ongoing business operations. Management believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and its ability to perform in subsequent periods. Equinix believes that if it did not provide such non-GAAP financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze Equinix effectively.",
			"Investors should note that the non-GAAP financial measures used by Equinix may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as those of other companies. Investors should, therefore, exercise caution when comparing non-GAAP financial measures used by us to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. Equinix does not provide forward-looking guidance for certain financial data, such as depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation, net income or loss from operations, cash generated from operating activities and cash used in investing activities, and as a result, is not able to provide a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for forward-looking data without unreasonable effort. The impact of such adjustments could be significant. Equinix intends to calculate the various non-GAAP financial measures in future periods consistent with how they were calculated for the periods presented within this press release.",

			"<em>This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from expectations discussed in such forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, risks to our business and operating results related to the current inflationary environment; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; increased costs to procure power and the general volatility in the global energy market; the challenges of acquiring, operating and constructing IBX and xScale data centers and developing, deploying and delivering Equinix products and solutions; unanticipated costs or difficulties relating to the integration of companies we have acquired or will acquire into Equinix; a failure to receive significant revenues from customers in recently built out or acquired data centers; failure to complete any financing arrangements contemplated from time to time; competition from existing and new competitors; the ability to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds to repay new or outstanding indebtedness; the loss or decline in business from our key customers; risks related to our taxation as a REIT and other risks described from time to time in Equinix filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

			"\"Public Storage’s first quarter was robust, with move-in volumes up nearly 13%, same store NOI up more than 11%, and non-same store acquisition and development NOI up nearly 30%,\" said Joe Russell, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We are focused on operations, leading the self-storage industry’s digital evolution, transforming our operating model, and enhancing and growing our portfolio. We see opportunity across our business and are uniquely positioned to execute on delivering growth and value to our stakeholders.\"",
			"<b><span>Highlights for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023</span></b>",
			"<b><span>Operating Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023</span></b>",
			"For the three months ended March 31, 2023, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $467.6 million or $2.65 per diluted common share, compared to $464.1 million or $2.63 per diluted common share for the same period in 2022, representing an increase of $3.5 million or $0.02 per diluted common share. The increase is due primarily to (i) a $92.0 million increase in self-storage net operating income and (ii) a $15.3 million increase in interest and other income, partially offset by (iii) a $62.2 million increase in foreign currency exchange losses primarily associated with our Euro denominated notes payable and (iv) a $37.4 million decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities due to our sale of PSB in July 2022.",
			"The $92.0 million increase in self-storage net operating income in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022 is a result of a $64.4 million increase attributable to our Same Store Facilities and a $27.6 million increase attributable to our Non-Same Store Facilities (as defined below). Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 9.8% or $75.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot, partially offset by a decline in occupancy. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 5.6% or $11.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022, due primarily to increased property tax expense, repairs and maintenance expenses, marketing expense, and other direct property costs. The increase in net operating income of $27.6 million for the Non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2021 and 2022 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities.",
			"<b><span>Funds from Operations</span></b>",
			"Funds from Operations (\"FFO\") and FFO per share are non-GAAP measures defined by Nareit. We believe that FFO and FFO per share are useful to REIT investors and analysts in measuring our performance because Nareit’s definition of FFO excludes items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating and financial performance. FFO represents net income before depreciation and amortization, which is excluded because it is based upon historical costs and assumes that building values diminish ratably over time, while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions. FFO also excludes gains or losses on sale of real estate assets and real estate impairment charges, which are also based upon historical costs and are impacted by historical depreciation. FFO and FFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. FFO is not a substitute for net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes investing and financing activities presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition, other REITs may compute these measures differently, so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful.",
			"For the three months ended March 31, 2023, FFO was $3.94 per diluted common share as compared to $3.83 for the same period in 2022, representing an increase of 2.9%.",
			"We also present \"Core FFO\" and \"Core FFO per share,\" non-GAAP measures that represent FFO and FFO per share excluding the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses, (ii) charges related to the redemption of preferred securities, and (iii) certain other non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items primarily representing, with respect to the periods presented below, the impact of contingency resolution, due diligence costs incurred in pursuit of strategic transactions, unrealized gain on private equity investments, and our equity share of severance of a senior executive from our equity investees. We review Core FFO and Core FFO per share to evaluate our ongoing operating performance, and we believe they are used by investors and REIT analysts in a similar manner. However, Core FFO and Core FFO per share are not substitutes for net income and net income per share. Because other REITs may not compute Core FFO or Core FFO per share in the same manner as we do, may not use the same terminology, or may not present such measures, Core FFO and Core FFO per share may not be comparable among REITs.",
			"The following table reconciles net income to FFO and Core FFO and reconciles diluted earnings per share to FFO per share and Core FFO per share (unaudited):",
			"<b><span>Property Operations – Same Store Facilities</span></b>",
			"The Same Store Facilities consist of facilities that have been owned and operated on a stabilized level of occupancy, revenues, and cost of operations since January 1, 2021. Our Same Store Facilities increased from 2,276 facilities at December 31, 2022 to 2,348 at March 31, 2023. The composition of our Same Store Facilities allows us to more effectively evaluate the ongoing performance of our self-storage portfolio in 2021, 2022, and 2023 and exclude the impact of fill-up of unstabilized facilities, which can significantly affect operating trends. We believe the Same Store information is used by investors and analysts in a similar manner. However, because other REITs may not compute Same Store Facilities in the same manner as we do, may not use the same terminology, or may not present such a measure, Same Store Facilities may not be comparable among REITs. The following table summarizes the historical operating results (for all periods presented) of these 2,348 facilities (155.5 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 76% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at March 31, 2023 (unaudited):",
			"<b><span>Property Operations – Non-Same Store Facilities</span></b>",
			"In addition to the 2,348 Same Store Facilities, we have 529 facilities that were not stabilized with respect to occupancies, revenues, or cost of operations since January 1, 2021 or that we did not own as of January 1, 2021, including 311 facilities that were acquired, 49 newly developed facilities, 87 facilities that have been expanded or are targeted for expansion, and 82 facilities that are unstabilized because they are undergoing fill-up or were damaged in casualty events (collectively, the \"Non-Same Store Facilities\"). Operating data, metrics, and further commentary with respect to these facilities, including detail by vintage, are included in \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" under \"Analysis of Net Income – Self-Storage Operations\" in our March 31, 2023 Form 10-Q.",
			"<b><span>Investing and Capital Activities</span></b>",
			"During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we closed the acquisition of five self-storage facilities (one each in Florida, Idaho, Kentucky, Michigan, and Virginia) with 0.3 million net rentable square feet for $46.8 million.",
			"Subsequent to March 31, 2023, we acquired or were under contract to acquire 12 self-storage facilities across three states with 0.9 million net rentable square feet, for $139.0 million.",
			"During 2021, we acquired a portfolio of 48 properties (4.1 million net rentable square feet) operated under the brand name of ezStorage for $1.8 billion. As of March 31, 2023, we have completed the expansion projects on four facilities of this portfolio for $26.3 million, adding 169,000 net rentable square feet of storage space. These facilities generated revenues of $25.6 million, NOI of $20.0 million (including Direct NOI of $20.5 million), and average square footage occupancy of 85.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2023.",
			"During 2021, we acquired a portfolio of 56 properties (7.5 million net rentable square feet) operated under the brand name of All Storage for $1.5 billion. These facilities generated revenues of $21.4 million, NOI of $13.3 million (including Direct NOI of $14.2 million), and average square footage occupancy of 78.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2023.",
			"During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we opened three newly developed facilities and completed various expansion projects (0.4 million net rentable square feet – 0.1 million each in Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania) costing $65.3 million. At March 31, 2023, we had various facilities in development (2.4 million net rentable square feet) estimated to cost $537.8 million and various expansion projects (2.4 million net rentable square feet) estimated to cost $488.2 million. Our aggregate 4.8 million net rentable square foot pipeline of development and expansion facilities includes 1.7 million in California, 0.9 million in Texas, 0.4 million in Nevada, 0.3 million each in Florida, Hawaii, and Maryland, 0.2 million in Washington, and 0.7 million in other states. The remaining $648.6 million of development costs for these projects are expected to be incurred primarily in the next 18 to 24 months.",
			"<b><span>Distributions Declared</span></b>",
			"On May 2, 2023, our Board of Trustees declared a regular common quarterly dividend of $3.00 per common share. The Board also declared dividends with respect to our various series of preferred shares. All the dividends are payable on June 29, 2023 to shareholders of record as of June 14, 2023.",
			"<b><span>Outlook for the Year Ending December 31, 2023</span></b>",
			"Set forth below are our current expectations with respect to full year 2023 Core FFO per share and certain underlying assumptions. In reliance on the exception provided by applicable SEC rules, we do not provide guidance for GAAP net income per share, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, or a reconciliation of 2023 Core FFO per share to GAAP net income per share because we are unable to reasonably predict the following items which are included in GAAP net income: (i) gains or losses on sales of real estate investments, (ii) foreign currency exchange gains and losses, (iii) charges related to the redemption of preferred securities, and (iv) certain other significant non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items. The actual amounts for any and all of these items could significantly impact our 2023 GAAP net income and, as disclosed in our historical financial results, have significantly impacted GAAP net income in prior periods.",

			"<strong>Extra Space Storage Inc.</strong> EXR reported first-quarter 2023 core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $2.02, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.05.<br/><br/>Quarterly revenues of $503.1 million also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $513.7 million.<br/><br/>Results reflect lower-than-anticipated revenues on lower occupancy levels. Higher operating expenses acted as a dampener in the quarter. The company also maintained its 2023 outlook.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, on a year-over-year basis, while core FFO per share improved marginally, revenues increased 13.4%.",
			"Same-store rental revenues increased 7.4% year over year to $384.1 million in the first quarter. This uptick resulted from higher average rates to existing customers and a rise in other operating income, partly muted by lower occupancy.<br/><br/>Same-store expenses increased 3.5% year over year to $93.2 million, reflecting an increase in payroll, marketing, credit card processing fees, utilities, and insurance, partially offset by savings in repairs and maintenance, and property taxes.<br/><br/>Consequently, same-store net operating income (NOI) increased 8.7% year over year to $290.9 million.<br/><br/>The same-store square-foot occupancy contracted 80 basis points year over year to 93.5% as of Mar 31, 2023.",
			"During the first quarter, Extra Space Storage acquired one store at completion of construction for around $13.1 million. In association with joint-venture (JV) partners, EXR acquired five operating stores for a total cost of $101.2 million, of which, it invested $20.2 million.<br/><br/>The company added 48 stores (44 store net) to its third-party management platform. As of Mar 31, 2023, it managed 931 stores for third parties and 323 stores in unconsolidated JVs, resulting in 1,254 total stores under management.",
			"Extra Space Storage exited the first quarter of 2023 with $47.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, down from $92.8 million recorded as of Dec 31, 2022.<br/><br/>As of Mar 31, 2023, EXR's percentage of fixed-rate debt to total debt was 70.7%. The combined weighted average interest rate was 4.3%, with a weighted average maturity of around five years.<br/><br/>During the reported quarter, Extra Space Storage originated $53 million in mortgage and mezzanine bridge loans. It also sold $34.2 million in mortgage bridge loans.<br/><br/>In the first quarter, the company did not issue any shares under its at-the-market program and presently has $800 million available for issuance. Also, it did not repurchase any shares of common stock and had the authorization to buy up to an additional $337 million under the plan as of Mar 31, 2023.",
			"Extra Space Storage maintained its guidance for the current year.<br/><br/>It earlier projected core FFO per share in the range of $8.30-$8.60. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $8.53, which lies within the guided range.<br/><br/>Management retained its estimates for same-store revenue growth at 3.75-5.25%, same-store expenses at 5-6% and same-store NOI growth in the band of 3-5.5%.<br/><br/>Extra Space Storage currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Moreover, the figure reflects a rise of 5.7% from the prior-year quarter.<br/><br/>SBAC’s site-leasing revenues improved year over year on healthy leasing activity amid elevated tower space demand. Moreover, it has continued to benefit from the addition of sites to its portfolio. The company also raised its 2023 outlook.<br/><br/><strong>Digital Realty Trust</strong> DLR reported first-quarter 2023 core FFO per share of $1.66, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a whisker. The figure, however, fell short of the year-ago quarter’s $1.67.<br/><br/>DLR experienced year-over-year growth in operating revenues during the quarter. However, rising rental property operating expenses acted as a dampener.<br/><br/><strong>Prologis, Inc.</strong> PLD reported first-quarter 2023 core FFO per share of $1.22, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21. This also compares favorably with the year-ago quarter’s figure of $1.09.<br/><br/>PLD’s results reflected solid demand for industrial real estate, leading to low vacancies and an increase in rents. The industrial REIT raised the midpoint of its 2023 guidance.",

			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"Thank you. Good afternoon, and I'm pleased to report our first quarter results. We are off to a good start with results that exceeded our plan. First quarter funds from operation were $1.03 billion or $2.74 per share. Let me walk through some variances for this quarter compared to Q1 of 2022. Domestic operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.15 of growth, primarily driven by higher rental income. Our international operations also performed well and contributed $0.02 of growth. <br/>These positive contributions were partially offset by declines from the headwind from a strong U.S. dollar of $0.02, higher interest rate expense of $0.05, lower lease settlement income of $0.06 compared to Q1 of 2022, and we had a mark-to-market gain on publicly held securities of $0.06 for the quarter, and a $0.13 lower contribution from our other platform investments compared to Q1 2022. <br/>Let me walk you through some of that and remind everyone that for OPI results, we are generally on our plan. Please keep in mind OPI was up against very tough comparisons from last year's Q1. This quarter also includes onetime transaction cost from ABG's recent acquisition activity, JCPenney's deployment of their new beauty initiative and investments related to physical stores, IT and onetime reorganization expenses all flowing through our FFO number. The retailer part of our OPI investments has seasonality associated with it generally with losses in the first quarter and the majority of our profit in the fourth quarter and should be modeled accordingly. Overall, we continue to expect OPI to meet our 2023 guidance we provided at the beginning of the year, which is similar -- which will be a similar FFO contribution that was compared to 2022. <br/>Now domestic property NOI increased 4% year-over-year for the quarter. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency, grew 3.9% for the quarter. Our malls and outlet occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 94.4%, an increase of 110 basis points compared to the prior year. Mills was 97.3%, and TRG was 93.3%, and importantly, average base minimum rent was $55.84 per square foot, an increase of 3.1% year-over-year. <br/>Leasing momentum continued across the portfolio. We signed more than 1,200 leases for more than 5.9 million square feet in the quarter. We have an additional 1,500 deals in our pipeline, including renewals for approximately $570 million in gross occupancy cost. More than 25% of our leasing activity in the first quarter was new deal volume. We're seeing strong broad-based demand from the retail community, including continued strength from many categories. By the end of the second quarter, we expect to be approximately 75% complete with our 2023 expiration. <br/>Retail sales momentum continued. Reported retail sales per square foot reached another record in the first quarter at $759 per square foot for malls and premium outlets combined, an increase of 3.3%. All platforms achieved record sales level, including the mills at $6.83 a foot, a 2.2%, and TRG was $1,100 per square foot, a 6% increase. <br/>Good news is tourism is returning with our tourist-oriented centers outperforming the portfolio average in terms of sales. Our occupancy cost at the end of the first quarter was 12%. We opened our West Paris designer outlet in Normandy, France, last week, our 35th international outlet center. <br/>During the quarter, construction restarted on our upscale outlet center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which will now open in the fall of 2024. We have several densification projects under construction, and a pipeline of identified projects that includes approximately 2,000 residential units and hotel rooms. <br/>Now turning to the balance sheet. We completed a dual tranche U.S. senior notes offering that totaled $1.3 billion at a combined average term of 20 years at an average coupon of 5.67%. We closed on our new $5 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility with a maturity in 2028. Importantly, the pricing is unchanged from our prior facility. The traditional secured mortgage markets continue to support the refinancing of our assets across geographies and property types. Our A-rated balance sheet is as strong as ever. <br/>We ended the quarter with $9.3 billion of liquidity. Today, we announced our dividend of $1.85 per share for the second quarter, a year-over-year increase of 9%. The dividend is payable on June 30 of this quarter. Guidance for this quarter, given the results of this quarter and our current view of the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year 2023 guidance range from $11.70 to $11.95 per share, to $11.80 to $11.95 per share compared to last year of $11.87. This is an increase of $0.10 at the bottom end of the range and $0.05 at the midpoint. <br/>And I'm pleased with our first quarter results. Tenant demand is excellent, and brick-and-mortar stores are where shoppers want to be. And even with the economic uncertainty, we are running ahead of our internal plan. Excuse me here, I have some kind of frog in my throat, but we're ready for questions.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs.",
			"<strong>Caitlin Burrows</strong>",
			"Maybe regarding upcoming lease maturities and what that means for potential cash flow changes going forward, the ABR for '23 maturities is around $62 versus the portfolio overall at $56. So would you think it's fair to say that the rest of the '23 maturities may face a headwind on renewal, but then the '24 maturities, which are 12% of rents and have an ABR of $54, have significant opportunity? I'm guessing it's not that straightforward. So wondering if you could discuss that rent maturity and mark-to-market outlook?",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"Yes. Thank you, Caitlin, for the question. One of the numbers I threw out there while I was coughing during my presentation was our renewals and new leases will add $570 million of basically gross rental income. In that is included some renewals, which is the roll off of some of the numbers that you quoted. We are renewing above our overall -- above our expiring rents. So even with that said, we expect to continue to have positive rental spreads, even with the higher number for the balance of this year and certainly in '24. So the outlook on that front is very positive and unchanged since our commentary at the -- certainly, at the beginning of this year and fourth quarter of last year as well.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI.",
			"<strong>Stephen Thomas Sakwa</strong>",
			"I was wondering if you could just maybe shed a little more light on the leasing demand that you're seeing. Is there anything that you could discuss with us on kind of price point, either luxury versus more moderate tenants? Anything by region? Anything by product type, whether it's the mills, the outlets, the traditional malls? Just looking for a little color, given what we're going through and kind of what your tenants are telling you. Just kind of curious where the strongest demand is, and maybe to the extent that there are any weak spots, what would you call out?",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"Well, I mean, I know this is kind of in the face of a lot of economic uncertainty, but demand really has not changed when I owed it. Now let's talk about the luxury side. Clearly, they're running up against tough comps compared to Q1 of last year. But those brands and those companies think long term. And I mean, the best example is if we were at the opening of the Tiffany store in -- on 57th Street. You have to take a long-term view when you open stores like that. And all of those brands, whether LVMH Group, Kering, Richemont, et cetera, they're looking at '23, '24, '25. We're -- making commitments. Nothing there is really abated. So all systems go on that front, even though they're running up against tough comps compared to Q1. <br/>You look at the restaurant category, very strong demand. Lots of new deals across lots of price points, from P.F. Chang's, Cheesecake Factory, to some of the chef-driven brands. So all systems go there. You've got the box demand, lots of new business with Dick's, Life Time Fitness, the best of the best. SCHEELS department store demand by [now] is happening. Then you look at athleisure, Vuori, Alo, lululemon, Brooks Brothers, all of that, pretty much across the board, we're seeing new stores. <br/>So I said this at the end of last year, early this year, even with -- even though comps are going to be tougher in this year in terms of sales compared to last year, the demand on leasing really has not changed. We're seeing the entertainment concepts come back. Theater business is positive. So we feel it's -- we're feeling very good. Obviously, we're cautious. We don't expect sales like they were over '21 and '22. <br/>And we planned accordingly. But demand, we check every day, and there's certainly a couple here or there that slowed down, but nothing of -- nothing really noteworthy. VS, North Face, Timberland, Cotton On, they're all growing, and it's all pretty healthy.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley.",
			"<strong>Ronald Kamdem</strong>",
			"Great. I remember last quarter, we talked about domestic property NOI growth of at least 2%. And you're thinking about looking at 1Q already at 4%. Just maybe can you give us an update how you're thinking about that number for the rest of the year? And looking at the guidance raise, how much of that property -- core property NOI versus maybe other factors?",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"Sure. Yes, we're going to beat 2%. And I would hope we would do at least 3 plus. I mean there is some -- it's very interesting, the first 6 months from a retail point of view, comps will be tough, but we think the second half for the retailers will be more positive, lots of economic uncertainty out there with the big macro things, but assuming sales come in the way we initially budgeted, we should be hopefully at least 3%. If we have an uptick in sales, we'll do better.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler.",
			"<strong>Alexander David Goldfarb</strong>",
			"So first, thank you for all the detail on the retailer platform and the emphasis on the seasonality, so that's helpful. My question is bigger. You guys seem to have a lot of positive trends with the redevelopment program coming back, retailer demand healthy. Obviously, some of your competitors are having trouble on the capital side. It strengthens your portfolio. So my question is, as you look over the next few years to invest incremental capital, is your focus still on the best returns or internal in your existing malls and adding more densification? Or are you starting to see some external opportunities where it may make sense to use capital and whether that's domestically or a broad of -- sort of curious.",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"Yes. I don't see -- let me do it in pieces with no particular order. I do see -- I still do feel strongly that the best use of our capital is making our existing portfolio better and better. I think that's -- we have spent $8-plus billion over the last several years upgrading the portfolio and doing new development. So we continue to see that as our best use. I don't see -- and as I mentioned in the call, I mean, we have a residential pipeline that looks really attractive and hotels that are generating really good accretive values of around 2,000 units. <br/>Now that's not going to happen overnight, but that's going to happen over the next few years. So that, for us, is a real opportunity. I don't see much of our external capital doing any kind of acquisition opportunities internationally. I still think we'll grow our international Asia outlet portfolio with redevelopment and new development over time, essentially recycling the capital -- the cash flow that we have there on accretive new development. And we're looking at everything domestically here, and nothing really has wet -- I think I could say this, wet our whistle here to make us -- I can say that, right? Okay. So nothing here that would...",
			"<strong>Alexander David Goldfarb</strong>",
			"You said it.",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"Yes. I said it. True. Good point. Nothing here that would really -- like we're not jumping up and down to do external transactions. So it's mostly the same stuff that we've been doing and just keep plugging away on that. And look, I do think we have to expect the capital markets. The capital markets are telling all companies to be more prudent to do more accretive investments, and we are listening very closely to that.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Vince Tibone from Green Street.",
			"<strong>Vince James Tibone</strong>",
			"I wanted to follow up on your comment regarding 2,000 residential and hotel units in the upcoming pipeline. Just curious how quickly you could start these projects, how much spend this could potentially represent? And if this is something that you're going to maybe do through joint ventures or would be wholly owned on the balance sheet? Kind of any color on some of these points would be helpful.",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"Sure. All right. So I think we will do selective JVs on certain of the residential development. So that's -- and it may -- it also may be that we could potentially bring in third-party equity, too. So that would -- we'll look at each deal individually, but that's certainly a possibility. And then I think, Vince, essentially, we're looking at -- to reach all those 2,000 units. It's really probably a 5-year build process. We expect to start several this year. But yet, we're frankly, being a little bit cautious. We're still permitting some things in California and the Northwest. So we don't -- we're going to just see how the world is, but we don't have to make a decision yet. And I would think at the end of the day, off the -- I'd rather Brian give you a more scientific number because a lot of these are part of redevelopments, too. <br/>And so to really isolate the hotel, apartment or rental stuff, I'd want to give you a number, but I -- my instinct would be probably about $1.5 billion. But I think Brian can give you more detailed number, but somewhere in that range. And these go from Austin, Texas, to Orange County, California, to Seattle, some hotels in Florida, some residential in Florida, multifamily. So it's kind of where you'd expect it to be where supply and demand is in our favor. But we're considering building a hotel in Cape Cod because we think there's a good supply-demand imbalance there. <br/>So it really is across. And every -- I'd say, generally, as we get that real estate through our redevelopment efforts, the big focus is on where we can add some mixed uses because we do think like what we did in Buckhead is having a tremendous impact on the overall value of that real estate. So not only does it -- is it accretive from a value point of view just on the cost to -- the return on the build versus what the value that is after it's built, but also the residual benefits that we see from them all.",
			"<strong>Vince James Tibone</strong>",
			"Got it. No, that's all super helpful. And then somewhat related follow-up question. Just curious if you could share any updates on the Carson outlet project. And if you think you'd be moving forward there in the near term?",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"That's a complicated one. We are -- that's a complicated one, but we're -- every day, we make progress. So it's terrific real estate, very complicated transaction, but we continue to make progress, but no final decision has been made to do it, but I expect one to be made over the next few months.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Craig Mailman from Citi.",
			"<strong>Nicholas Gregory Joseph</strong>",
			"It's actually Nick Joseph on here with Craig. David, just on executive comp and the $24 million onetime cash bonus related to OPI. I know at least one of the proxy analysis firms has raised some concerns on it. So hoping you could give some more color on what the rationale behind it in terms of the amount and the structure of it ahead of the vote later this week?",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"Yes. Look, I think this was essentially paid to 23, 24 executives last February, so about 15 months ago. Fully disclosed in an 8-K. Our rationale and reasoning by the comp committee was fully disclosed in our filed proxy as well as a supplemental letter to our shareholders. I think if you look at the company in totality, which is important, I mean, we can always pick a moment in time to say, why this, why that? But if you look at the history of the company, you look at executive comp, you look at our stock program, you look at our burn rate, you look at our G&amp;A as a function of our NOI or asset value, we are at the lowest of the low.<br/>Anybody can pick out one particular number they don't like. But if you look at it in totality, we are absolutely proud of how we run this business. If you want to get more detail, I encourage you to talk to Head of our Comp Committee, or our Lead Independent Director, any shareholder can do that. But I would encourage everyone to look at the totality of our history and then come to whatever conclusion they think. And we're very happy to talk to anybody that would like to go through it from a shareholder point of view.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Greg McGinniss from Scotiabank.",
			"<strong>Greg Michael McGinniss</strong>",
			"I just want to make sure that I understand that $570 million gross rental income number that you mentioned, is that new and renewal leases? Is it on a pro rata basis, inclusive of international and DRG? How much of that, I guess, is incremental to in-place rents? Or is all of it? And then what's the time frame that you think they're contributing?",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"All terrific questions. And we highlighted that just to give you a sense of the scope of the business that's going on here. So that's a huge number. That's just one leash -- one level of activity in the year-end, and it's bigger than some companies that exists today. <br/>So let me try to unpack it. It does include renewals. It's just SPG. It's just domestic. And if you look at the renewals and the new business, there's a really good uptick from kind of the in-place income on that. And that will come in not really this year but over '24 and '25 as those stores get opened. And I think it just adds a sense of our future growth that we see in front of us from our existing portfolio. But I'm not in a position to break it out between renewals and new incremental business, but you'll see that flow through the NOI in the upcoming quarters.",
			"<strong>Greg Michael McGinniss</strong>",
			"Okay. So it is both, though, because you mentioned $100 million of new income last quarter -- of new NOI.",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"Correct. Yes, it includes both, correct.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank.",
			"<strong>Derek Charles Johnston</strong>",
			"Occupancy is now at 94.4%, and that's just 70 bps below pre-pandemic levels. Do you expect to surpass 4Q '19's 95.1% occupancy this year? And given the leasing demand we've discussed, how is the team weighing occupancy versus rates now that the gap is so narrow?",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"Well, let me take that part first. I do think -- the good news is that when we're -- and again, every lease is different. Every relationship is different. Rollovers -- some rollovers go down. But I would say, generally speaking, we are finally seeing renewals that are overall above the expiring rents. So that -- and part of that is just supply/demand is in our favor, and we are getting -- because one is -- I think from the retailer's point of view, there's a real appreciation for bricks and mortar, one. Two is they know we're a landlord that they can rely on, and that we're going to do the right thing to maintain and reinvest in these properties and we have the capability of doing so. <br/>And generally, there's more demand that we're seeing. And the retailers are in, having survived COVID, are in better shape and want to grow their business. So that has all happened. And getting to your first point, will we beat it this year, it will be close. I'm not -- I can't guarantee it. But I am hopeful that we will beat that number in the not -- certainly within the next 12 months, assuming we can continue to maintain reasonably decent economic conditions.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Floris Van Dijkum from Compass Point.",
			"<strong>Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum</strong>",
			"David, so maybe if you can give us a little bit more of an update? I know in the past you've talked about your signed, not open pipeline being around 200 basis points. Your leased occupancy just increased by 110 basis points. Is that SNO pipeline relatively similar? And then maybe, I mean, the -- if I look at the base rent going up by 3.1% approximately and if you get about 10% of your space back, I mean, it assumes pretty healthy re-leasing spreads, if my math is correct. I mean how should we be thinking? Because clearly, it appears that leasing spreads are accelerating in your core business?",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"I think that's a fair statement. And I would say that the pipeline is similar to what it's been, right, Brian?",
			"<strong>Brian J. McDade</strong>",
			"Yes, Floris, we're still hanging right around 200 basis points at this point in the year.",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"So I do think it -- as we've been saying over the last few couple of quarters, I mean, we have finally turned the corner on lease spreads. Demand, better properties, more commitments from retailers, more -- and more retailers wanting to open stores all driving pretty good demand, which allows us to get the spreads that we were accustomed to. But we were flatlining pre-COVID. Obviously, we got hurt during COVID, and we bounced back nicely. And so from that standpoint, it's good to see.",
			"<strong>Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum</strong>",
			"And if I can maybe follow up, David, on Jamestown and you mentioned external capital. How are you thinking about -- how is the Jamestown acquisition betting in? And is that potentially a source of external capital that you can bring into some of that -- the apartment or hotel investments and/or how are the synergies between those 2 businesses working out? And in particular, I'm thinking like Atlanta with the street retail right near your 2 fortress malls.",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"Yes. Look, I -- to separate -- just to be clear. So we bought into the asset management business. We bought -- we partnered with Jamestown for a couple of -- several reasons, but a couple to highlight here. One is they're really good asset managers. Two is they have the development capability that's very interesting to us, and they have excellent institutional relationships. And we think with our partnership, we can grow that business. We did not -- other than -- there is a big future development, master plan development that they're working on in Charleston where we did partner with them directly. We did not buy any of their existing real estate that's owned by the various funds, whether it's the German funds or the premier fund. <br/>Jamestown is in the process of raising their, what, 32nd German fund. They have a lot of separate account interest. It's really good for us because we get to learn those institutional investors better and more. And I just think we're early days there. But I think the thesis that we had going in continues to be very, very valid. This is a long-term relationship that I think will grow. Eventually, I see us partnering with institutional money that will be managed by Jamestown, that will partner with us to build XYZ or buy XYZ or build a big community in Charleston -- North Charleston. <br/>So yes, I think all of the elements of potential growth with Jamestown are out there. We do like the asset management business as a platform. We dipped our toe into it. But I think, again, just as we look at the landscape of real estate owners and managers, we think -- when we look at a Blackstone, when we look at a Brookfield, obviously, they own. They asset manage. For us to have some scale or some role in that business, I think, ultimately, (inaudible) to the benefit of Simon Property Group, and that's what we're asking.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Craig Schmidt from Bank of America.",
			"<strong>Craig Richard Schmidt</strong>",
			"Given the seasonality of the OPI business, which quarter do you expect that number to turn positive?",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"I think it will be -- Craig, you know about retailers. So just to reinforce the retail part of OPI, remember, the vast majority of the OPI value is in our ABG stock. But we still have a very profitable business with both Penney and SPARC and then other investments that are in that, including RGG and so on. So just important to put it in context. So the retail part, the pure retailer part, Penney and SPARC, is seasonal. And last quarter -- Q1 of '22 was just stimulus, whatever, was a really tough comparison for the retail -- retailer part of OPI. With that said, it will -- we expect it to be profitable in Q2 and Q3. And -- but the vast -- the majority -- the vast majority of it will be Q4 like all the other retailers. <br/>So when you see retailers report this quarter that are public, I think generally, they'll probably all have tough comps against Q1 of last year. Yes, the comps get a lot easier. This is a lot more information for a business that we have no cash investment remember, and it does create a little volatility of our earnings for better or worse. In this case, this quarter, it's worse. Fourth quarter will be much better. It does create a little volatility. But it'll -- you'll see us map out part of that OPI map out just like other retailers where the loss will be in Q1, profitability in Q2 and 3 and then 70% -- 65%, 70% in Q4.",

			"The next question comes from Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital Markets.",
			"<strong>Juan Carlos Sanabria</strong>",
			"Just hoping to get a little color on the month-to-month leases. They ticked up from about 4.5% to 7.5% sequentially in the first quarter, while you did a fantastic job chopping wood and reducing the rest of the ['23 expirations]. But just curious on why the increase in the month-to-month leases and what's going on behind that?",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"Yes. One of the comments I made was we expect to be basically 75% by the end of Q2. It's just a process. It's just -- we're negotiating. The retailers are negotiating. The stores are open and operating. But we -- it's just a typical drawn-out process that is the, so to speak, the art of the negotiation. But a lot of that's already handshake committed to that we're just going through and processing now.",
			"<strong>Brian J. McDade</strong>",
			"If you look at it [currently, Juan], it's just normal seasonality of that line item at this point time in the year.",

			"The next question comes from Mike Mueller from JPMorgan.",
			"<strong>Michael William Mueller</strong>",
			"I was wondering, has there been any notable change in lease duration for what you're signing so far in 2023 compared to last year?",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"Not really. Not at all.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Haendel Juste from Mizuho.",
			"<strong>Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste</strong>",
			"David, I think earlier you mentioned that new leases were 25% of deal volume in the first quarter. I guess I'm curious if that's why CapEx ticked up. It was up 8% in the quarter. And if this is also a new level of new versus renewal leasing that we should expect near term?",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"We have a tough connection. Did you guys hear that?",
			"<strong>Brian J. McDade</strong>",
			"Haendel, can you repeat your question, please? You kind of broke up a bit.",
			"<strong>Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste</strong>",
			"So my question was on -- David, I think you mentioned earlier in the call that new leases were 25% of the deal volume in the first quarter. So I'm curious if that's why CapEx was up, I think, 8% in the first quarter. And also if this level of new leases, 25% or so, would be kind of the right way to think about new versus renewal leasing going forward.",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"Yes. I think -- I guess, on the TA line, there is some -- we are doing more deals, so there is probably more TA associated with it. So I'm not sure -- the CapEx line or you're looking at the TA line. But generally, the answer is, yes, we're doing a lot more new business. And in some cases, that does mean a little bit more TA. And I still had a hard time on the last part. Did anybody hear it?",
			"<strong>Brian J. McDade</strong>",
			"No, we didn't hear it.",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"Unfortunately, we didn't hear it. But if you want to call back with -- we're happy to answer that.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from Truist.",
			"<strong>Ki Bin Kim</strong>",
			"Going back to your comments on international tourism, David, can you remind us where international tourism (inaudible) for your portfolio today versus, let's say, pre-COVID? And if it should return to that normal level, what does that mean for Simon's NOI or earnings, however you want to look at it?",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"Well, I would say, generally speaking, we -- just to give you a sense, our sales for our tourist properties that we identified was up 8% quarter-over-quarter, right, generally?",
			"<strong>Brian J. McDade</strong>",
			"Yes.",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"So the bottom line is it's really going to result in overage rent that we probably flatlined, more or less, on those properties. So -- and that will manifest itself once we reach the breakpoint, so later in the year. But we're seeing -- we're starting to see -- I mean, like Vegas -- where are our tourist properties? Florida, which has been pretty strong, but we're seeing more and more international tourism there. Woodbury here in the New York area -- I say here, I'm in Indianapolis -- but in the New York area is really starting to see a lot more international tourism. California has been kind of the weak link, but we're starting to see more and more sales there. And then Vegas is just going crazy. Vegas, we -- and we have really important exposure in Vegas between Forum, Crystals, our 2 outlet centers. <br/>Vegas is as good as it gets. It's the casinos, what's going on with the city, the movement from California to Nevada, all of the football, baseball, sporting activity, Formula 1. It's just -- it's a great place to have a lot of retail real estate, and we're seeing real benefits in that. So this will manifest itself in the fourth quarter as we've seen that. But -- as we reach the breakpoints. But we're finally seeing the international tourists come back to the States. A little weaker dollar helps and obviously, all the -- I think, finally, you don't have the vaccine card, whatever that's required, company or -- all of that's kind of yesterday's news, as of today or yesterday. So we're -- I think we're finally starting to see that come back like it was pre-pandemic.",
			"<strong>Ki Bin Kim</strong>",
			"Okay. And a quick question for Brian. You guys have a pretty healthy cash balance of over $1 billion, yet you still carry a balance on the revolver. I'm sure there's a pretty logical, simple answer to this, but just curious.",
			"<strong>Brian J. McDade</strong>",
			"Yes, that's exactly right. The outstandings on our revolver are denominated in euros, and they serve as a net investment hedge against our asset base in Europe. We do have a heavy -- a sizable cash balance as we did our offering earlier in this year and prefunded the balance of our unsecured maturities for this year. So we're carrying cash, and we'll pay off the June maturities at par at maturity.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Michael Goldsmith from UBS.",
			"<strong>Michael Goldsmith</strong>",
			"David, your base minimum rent growth is accelerating. You have a nice SNO pipeline. You're talking about blowing past your 2% NOI growth guidance for the year. All sounds great. I guess the question is, how sustainable is this algorithm? How long can it continue? And what are the factors that are ultimately going to weigh on this momentum that you have?",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"Well, look, I mean, I think -- I see it continuing. We see good demand. We are tied to the general economic condition, but supply/demand is in our favor. I think our spot in our industry is well established. We have the confidence with our retail partners. We know what we want to do with our properties. We're not -- we don't bat a thousand. We make mistakes all the time, but we know where we want to position them. And so I hate using kind of this, but it's really going to be the external environment that could slow this down, meaning what happens, do we do a recession or that. <br/>And I honestly think some of these markets are -- when people ask me that, I actually think if we do go into a recession, it will be \"this kind of regional recession.\" I just don't see markets right now -- they may flatten. They may not grow as much. But I don't see Floridas, Texas, Nevadas of the world, Georgias, I just don't see them slowing. I don't see them going into a recession. So if there is one, we've always heard, well, it's going to be a regional one. This one might be one. But who (inaudible), I really don't know. But I think that's what slows us down. Obviously, we do have some headwinds with higher interest rates. We do have a debt maturity at low rates that will rollover, will cost us some growth. But we just have to kind of go through that and deal with.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Linda Tsai from Jefferies.",
			"<strong>Linda Tsai</strong>",
			"How do you think about the longer-term growth profile of the OPI business versus growth in overall portfolio NOI? Do you think the OPI business requires more consistent investment before it generates more stable returns?",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"Well, I think you have to look at the individual investments. And like, for instance, Authentic Brands Group is a growth machine. They're buying brands left and right. They're buying Billabong. They're buying Vans. They've got a huge pipeline. So I really see that company growing, growing, growing. SPARC and Penney are -- SPARC is opening new stores, getting better at e-commerce, getting better operating. I'm sure -- they added Reebok to its portfolio last year. That still hasn't been fully integrated. So I expect EBITDA growth to accelerate in the latter half of '23 and '24. RGG, which includes Rue La La, Gilt and importantly, Shop Premium Outlets. Remember, we contributed to that joint venture. Shop Premium Outlets is on fire. We're growing our GMV by leaps and bounds. <br/>I really think -- this was an idea we had years ago. We kind of got it off the ground maybe not quite as good as [Wilbur -- but Wilbur, right]? But we got it off the ground. We merged it into RGG. And it's really rocking and rolling. We've got -- we're signing up good retailers all the time. That's got a great, great story to it. And we have some smaller investments in that. So I think I see a real growth pattern in all of those. Penney is reinvesting. I think Penney (inaudible). It's getting better brands in the store. We're making the stores look better. It's got growth in beauty that's investing. <br/>So the retailer side of OPI has a little more exposure to the economy because [retail just does]. But I think they all, in their own right, have their own growth story. And -- but you know what? We're economic animals to the extent that we think we get fair value. We've got lots of opportunities to invest in our company or other transactions that will add value. So we look at these very clinically. And I just remember, we've created a lot of value here with very little capital. And what's amazing, it's in our earnings now and -- which is a good sign because it means it's earning money. And given the small investment, it's been -- if you just want to look at return on earnings or return on investment, it's been outstanding. <br/>So very proud of it, very profitable, not our core focus yet. [I used] the executive team here to leverage our capabilities, intellectual firepower, et cetera, to make those companies better. And I think we've done a pretty darn good job, and we've had good partners across the board. So we've done it in a very prudent way, and it's been very beneficial for us. And I expect growth to continue -- have more ups and downs. It won't be a straight line, but I have -- I expect more growth from that category. At the same time, 10 years from now or 5 years from now, we don't have to own any of these companies.",
			"<strong>Linda Tsai</strong>",
			"And then just a follow-up, do you have a sense of how much mixed-use development could become as a percentage of portfolio NOI? And could you give us a sense of what that might represent today?",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"It's not very big today. What is it, like 3%, 4%?",
			"<strong>Brian J. McDade</strong>",
			"[About 3%].",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"3%. So we're a big company. So to do a lot to get to like 8% to 10% would take a lot, would be a few years down the road. But I don't see any reason why -- we certainly should try to strive to get up there if we can do it accretively in the kind of the 7%, 8% range. But that would be roughly $500-plus million of NOI. So it's not -- it's going to take time.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question -- the final question comes from Haendel Juste from Mizuho.",
			"<strong>Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste</strong>",
			"I wanted to get to the second part of my question, and then I have one more. So the second part of my earlier question was if you're expecting new lease volume to be about 25% of the overall leasing volume as they were in the first quarter over the near term.",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"Yes, I think that's a reasonable number, yes, in that range.",
			"<strong>Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste</strong>",
			"Okay. And then the second question I had was on foot traffic. We saw some recent Placer foot traffic data for March indicating that year-over-year foot traffic at enclosed retail malls is down 8% year-over-year in March. I'm curious if you're seeing similar trends at your properties and if you think that's [reflective of] the consumer and if that's coming up in lease negotiations in the current environment.",
			"<strong>David E. Simon</strong>",
			"Well, yes, that's -- I'm glad you asked that because I have -- we keep track of that ourselves. And just to give you March over -- March '23 over March '22, we are 105.5% for malls, 105.6% for mills and 120.2% for outlets for 108% above last year this time. And January and February, we're actually much higher month-over-month. So we -- for our portfolio, we're above -- traffic is above where it was this time last year, year-to-date, month-to-month.",

			"(Reuters) - Median pay for top U.S. CEOs rose 7.7% last year to a record $22.3 million, a new study found, as big stock awards helped the group stay ahead of inflation while U.S. workers' pay fell behind.",
			"Among those receiving big pay increases were the CEOs of Jefferies Financial Group and Prologis Inc according to the study being released on Wednesday by research firm Equilar.",
			"The study reviewed the 100 highest paid CEOs at U.S. public companies with revenue of $1 billion or more that reported compensation as of March 31. A similar review last year showed a 31% pay increase for CEOs for 2021.",
			"The U.S. consumer price index, a widely-used measure of inflation, rose 6.5% in the 12 months ended Dec 31, down from 7% in the year-earlier period.",
			"Pay among the CEOs rose faster than for U.S. workers in 2022 despite tight labor markets. Average weekly earnings for U.S. private sector employees was $1,132 in December, up 3.6% from a year earlier, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The CEO's higher gains pushed the median \"pay ratio\" at companies led by the CEOs studied by Equilar to 288 times the pay of their median employee, up from 254 times in 2021.",
			"The CEO pay gains came during a year when the total return of the S&amp;P 500 was negative 18% as the Federal Reserve's rate hikes slowed economic growth. Total return for the companies whose CEO pay was studied was negative 11%.",
			"GRAPHIC : CEO Compensation gains drive up pay ratio vs workers - https://www.reuters.com/graphics/CEO-PAY/STUDY/akveqjenlvr/chart.png",
			"Boosting the CEO's pay gains were stock awards that have become a centerpiece of U.S. executive compensation but not as much for employees. The median value of CEO's stock awards rose 20% to $13.8 million for 2022. Equilar director of research Courtney Yu said much of that was awarded at the start of last year, as companies looked to keep their top leaders in place.",
			"\"You want stability of leadership to guide you through tough times,\" Yu said. He added that amid the macroeconomic uncertainty, \"There's still a little more of this incentivizing of executives that's leading to the increases in CEO pay.\"",
			"HANG ON TO LEADERS",
			"One of the biggest pay increases went to Jefferies CEO Richard Handler, whose $56.9 million received last year was nearly double his total compensation in 2021.",
			"Must of the pay, $25 million, reflected a one-time \"leadership continuity grant\" of restricted stock, Jefferies' proxy states. At the company's March 29 shareholder meeting only a slim majority, 59%, of votes cast backed the pay.",
			"Asked about the pay, a Jefferies representative referred to a previous company description of actions it took in response to shareholder feedback, including that it would not make further special equity awards.",
			"Another big gain went to Hamid Moghadam, CEO of logistics real estate company Prologis, whose $48.2 million total compensation last year was 93% more than the year before, driven mainly by stock awards.",
			"A Prologis spokesperson said last year's awards reflected how the performance of part of its business exceeded three-year goals, creating value for investors. Founder Moghadam for years has taken a salary of just $1. \"Our CEO’s compensation is and will continue to be 100% performance based,\" the spokesperson said.",

			"<strong>Dallas B. Tanner</strong>",
			"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased to report a strong first quarter result yesterday afternoon, reflecting a great start for a year. Average same-store occupancy improved 50 basis points over the fourth quarter to 97.8%, and new lease rent growth has accelerated sequentially every month so far this year. We're encouraged by the execution of our teams and remain bullish on our industry and our business as long-term fundamentals continue to be favorable, bolstered by our superior balance sheet and liquidity and backed by our best-in-class platform, we will seek to continue to deliver sector-leading NOI growth as we've done for the past 5 years. <br/>Since our inception, we've matured and performed through a variety of operating and macroeconomic environments, including a global pandemic and record high inflation. Throughout this time, we've witnessed the resilience and the relative strength of our business. This is illustrated by a great chart from John Burns Research and Consulting that we included in our March investor deck. This data shows that over the past 40 years, national SFR rent growth has historically stayed positive even during recessions. <br/>In addition, in a recessionary period, we would expect that our business could see a reduction in move-outs and a benefit to occupancy. And that external growth opportunities could become more attractive. For these reasons and more, we believe single-family leasing is one of the most stable property types in real estate. <br/>The Invitation Homes offers one of the best risk-adjusted return propositions compared to other commercial real estate sectors. <br/>To start, supply and demand fundamentals continue to favor our business. On the demand side, this includes the demographic surge of the millennial generation who have begun reaching our average resident age of 39 years old. <br/>But it also includes individuals and families of all ages, who desire the flexibility and convenience of leasing a single-family home. Like all of us on the call today, our residents value great schools, proximity to growing job centers, access to transportation corridors in desirable neighborhoods for their families. They usually need or want more space with a garage and a yard to better fit their growing household and to have more room for a home office, a kids play room and their pets. <br/>And more importantly, today's residents are requesting flexibility and choice along with the appeal of a down payment-light lifestyle. Further driving the demand for single-family home leasing is the rising cost of homeownership as well as the lack of inventory of for-sale housing. <br/>According to John Burns March data, and weighted by our markets, the monthly cost of owning a single-family home remain on average over $900 more expensive than leasing that same home. Others have calculated an even higher cost of average for ownership versus leasing. <br/>On the supply side, the U.S. continues to suffer from a shortage of housing. With the shortfall in supply relative to demand estimated to be in the millions of units. Like most economists, we think the best way to improve housing affordability is to grow the U.S. housing stock. And more specifically, by encouraging development of new housing supply. This important work really needs to begin at the state and local levels, including planning and zoning boards. <br/>And we stand at a strong support of those who want to bring positive change in this regard. In fact, we see ourselves as part of the solution to increasing housing supply through our new product pipeline that is now approaching $1 billion. <br/>We will continue to seek out responsible opportunities to add supply and as a result, help improve housing availability and affordability. In consideration of these fundamentals, we believe leasing a home is a great option for anyone who wants all the benefits of living in a home without the hassle or expensive homeownership. And we believe Invitation Homes offers the best service, platform and locations for residents to choose from. <br/>One reason for this relates to the core belief we've held since the early days of our business that we could revolutionize the single-family resident experience by professionalizing resident service. In short, we took a decades-antiquated mom-and-pop model and transformed that based on the needs and desires of a 21st century resident. <br/>As part of that approach, we continue to expand our service offerings and look for new and better ways to enhance the simplicity and convenience of the leasing lifestyle. At the same time, we continue to explore ways to improve efficiency through size and scale. We also remain focused on growing our portfolio accretively over the long term. And more importantly, in locations where we would expect the most favorable long-term fundamentals. <br/>With regards to growth, we're committed to being prudent capital allocators through all real estate cycles. For the first quarter of 2023, this meant being a net seller of homes disposing of 284 wholly-owned homes for gross proceeds of $95 million and buying 181 wholly-owned homes for $62 million. For the most part, we've recycled capital out of less desirable homes and into brand-new well-located homes as part of our new product pipeline. <br/>We believe our strategy of partnering with the best homebuilders is a superior approach to investing on a risk-adjusted basis as it keeps development and its associated risk, including an expensive land bank and high G&amp;A load off of our balance sheet. <br/>At the same time, our strong balance sheet and current liquidity, including JV capital allows us to remain nimble and as opportunities arise, we will be ready. Before I close, I want to speak to the continued dislocation between the retail pricing of single-family homes and public market valuations. Strong demand for housing continues to support home prices in our markets and at our price points. While the lock-in effect, which existing homeowners are discouraged from giving up their longer mortgage rates is keeping resale supply relatively low. <br/>We're seeing evidence of this supply and demand imbalance when we list our homes for sale and receive multiple competing offers at great prices. <br/>We believe the resilience of the U.S. housing market in the current cycle has been underestimated over the past year, and that the protracted supply and demand imbalance for single-family housing continues to provide good structural support for home prices just as it does for rent growth. <br/>Lastly, on the topic of sustainability. I hope you've taken a moment to read our new progress overview, which we published last month. It's available on our sustainability web page and includes information about our efforts to increase the quantity and the quality of our ESG disclosures. This includes new greenhouse gas emission disclosures and an opportunity for engaged stakeholders to participate in an online survey to share their thoughts and their ideas with us. We welcome this feedback. <br/>My thanks again to all of our teams for their hard work, dedication and commitment this past quarter and for the remainder of the year ahead. Our associates are the heart and soul of Invitation Homes, and we appreciate how they embrace the responsibility to deliver the highest level of service to our residents and strong results for our shareholders. Our plan is to keep pushing to be great here. <br/>With that, I'll pass it on to Charles, our President and Chief Operating Officer.",
			"<strong>Charles D. Young</strong>",
			"Thanks, Dallas, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by thanking our associates for starting off the year strong. I'm really proud of the efforts you display every single day to ensure that our residents feel heard, served and appreciated. <br/>I'll now review the details of our first quarter operating results. I'll start with same-store core revenues, which grew 7.7% year-over-year. This growth was primarily driven by an 8.5% increase in average monthly rent and a 7.3% increase in other income. These results include some encouraging signs. Over half of our markets are now operating in a more normal course of business in terms of timely rent payments and resolution processes. <br/>For our other markets, progress continues to move in the right direction as we work through these lease compliance backlogs. These improvements were reflected in our first quarter bad debt, which beat our expectations by holding flat with our fourth quarter reported results even as rent assistance declined by over half during the same period. This indicates to us that residents are returning to a more normal payment pattern post COVID. <br/>We're also seeing stronger demand return following the winter leasing season with new lease rent growth accelerating sequentially each month during the first quarter. Overall, for the first quarter, same-store new lease rent growth came in at 5.7% and same-store renewal growth was 8%, resulting in blended rent growth of 7.3%. Our preliminary April results show further acceleration in the new lease side to 7.5% with renewals at 7.2% and blended 7.3%. Preliminary average occupancy in April was 97.8%. <br/>Turning back to our first quarter same-store results. Core operating expenses increased 14% year-over-year, representing a favorable result compared to our initial guidance expectations for the first quarter expense growth in the mid-teens. The year-over-year increase was driven by an expected year-over-year increase in property taxes due to robust home price appreciation. <br/>In addition to the under-accrual of property taxes expenses in the first 3 quarters of 2022, as we've previously discussed. Expense growth was also impacted by progress we've made in working through more of the lease compliance backlog compared with last year as well as higher vacant utility costs and rates and continued inflationary pressures. <br/>Taken together, these results led to first quarter growth in same-store NOI of 5% year-over-year. Our teams continue to pursue various ways to improve our efficiency and resident experience. With technology upgrades frequently topping the list. For example, we continue to put mobile technology into the hands of our residents. This includes a mobile experience for maintenance, which we've spoken about previously. This has been a great success with residents using it to send us over 40% of maintenance requests. In addition, we've also just launched a new mobile experience for leasing. That enables prospective residents to create a profile, save searches and view their favorite houses. In today's mobile-first world, these new mobile experiences are game changers for our residents and us. <br/>Many thanks to all of our teams for working diligently to manage all the details of our business this past quarter, while staying focused on resident service and operational excellence. I believe we are well equipped and energized to carry the positive momentum you've begun through our peak leasing season and the remainder of the year. <br/>I'll now turn the call over to Jon Olsen, the company's next Chief Financial Officer.",
			"<strong>Jonathan S. Olsen</strong>",
			"Thank you, Charles. I'm excited to join you all today. I've been part of the Invitation Homes team since 2012, and I'm honored to have been named CFO upon Ernie's departure next month. Ernie has led our finance organization for the past 7.5 years, and in that time, he has overseen tremendous growth and many important milestones for the company. <br/>We're both here in the room this morning to answer any questions you may have following our prepared remarks. <br/>I'll begin by covering our financial results for the first quarter and then provide an update on our investment-grade rated balance sheet and liquidity position before wrapping up to open the line for questions. <br/>As we've stated, our first quarter results were in line with or slightly ahead of our expectations and offer a solid start to the year. <br/>Core FFO for the first quarter of 2023 increased 9.5% year-over-year to $0.44 per share, primarily due to an increase in NOI, and AFFO increased 9% to $0.38 per share. Our full year 2023 guidance remains unchanged from the initial guidance we provided in February as we are still early in the year. <br/>Next, I'll cover our balance sheet and liquidity position. We believe this is an area of strength for us, not only in comparison to how far we've come since our public listing over 6 years ago, but also relative to many of our investment-grade peers today. In the 6 years since our IPO and merger, we have applied a consistent and measured strategy to delever the balance sheet, improve the laddering of our debt maturities, refinance secured debt with unsecured debt, unencumbered assets and lower our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. <br/>We ended the first quarter with over $1.3 billion in available liquidity comprised of our unrestricted cash and undrawn revolver capacity. We have no debt reaching final maturity before 2026. And at the end of the first quarter, over 99% of our debt was fixed rate or swapped to fixed rate, nearly 3/4 of our debt was unsecured and over 83% of our homes were unencumbered. <br/>Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved from 5.7x at the end of 2022 to 5.5x as of March 31. <br/>In recognition of the great work by our team and the meaningful progress we've made -- in March, S&amp;P Global Ratings upgraded our issuer and issue-level credit ratings from BBB- to BBB flat. <br/>In addition, last week, Moody's Investors Service revised our rating outlook from stable to positive. In closing, we're pleased to start the year strong and believe our favorable fundamentals, best-in-class operating platform, dedicated associates and strong balance sheet position us well to continue delivering solid results. <br/>On behalf of everyone at Invitation Homes, we extend our thanks to Ernie for the enormous impact he has made and look forward to furthering the legacy he helped build. <br/>With that, operator, please open the line for questions.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions). <br/>The first question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America.",
			"<strong>Joshua Dennerlein</strong>",
			"It's Josh Dennerlein. In the opening remarks, you mentioned demographics influencing demand, and it sounds like you expect sector-leading NOI growth to kind of continue as a result. I guess could you maybe walk us through the demographics that you're seeing come through your portfolio today? And how that's impacting your outlook?",
			"<strong>Dallas B. Tanner</strong>",
			"Yes. I think -- this is Dallas, by the way. One of the things we've been most bullish on has been the consistency around the fundamentals of who our customer is as they come in. The strength of what we would call the credit quality and the personal balance sheet. And I think lastly, the duration of stay. <br/>And as we've looked at our business over the last decade, literally quarter-over-quarter, we're seeing that duration and length of stay push well into the 40-ish type of months with us as they move out. We're seeing that in our West Coast markets, and we're seeing our Eastern markets start to quickly kind of close the gap. And so I think as you think about this millennial cohort, the types of things they want, the flexibility around choice, a leasing lifestyle. Charles talked about it in his opening remarks, this mobile-friendly kind of universe that we all operate in personally. It sets itself up to be very favorable for somebody who is looking for choice and flexibility while maintaining a down payment-light approach. We're seeing continued strength in the underwriting of the customer, as I mentioned my second point. And it continues to be impressed upon us that our top of funnel and the demand side of our business is extremely healthy. <br/>We have a lot of intrigue in properties as they become available. <br/>We have a lot of pre-leasing activity. And we're not seeing any real degradation in our customer as of today.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citibank.",
			"<strong>Unidentified Analyst</strong>",
			"Dallas, you've talked a lot about the lock-in effect on interest rates and what it's doing to sale inventory and ultimately transactions. Just curious whether you can see anything that would change that going forward? Or should we ultimately just expect a pretty depressed level of acquisitions for a long time.",
			"<strong>Dallas B. Tanner</strong>",
			"Well, I think there's 2 questions in that question. So -- the first piece on the lock-in effect with 80-some-odd percent of mortgages being [sub-5%], it has probably caused a lot of us and people that are in the market for housing to think about staying put, which I think has also impacted some of the resale supply. It's had a positive effect in our business because I also think it's helping support longer duration of stay, demand, et cetera. <br/>I think in terms of your question around the retail market and what we'd expect from sellers, yes, there's no doubt that if people are -- a mortgage today, if you acquired it or you refinanced in the last 36 months is an asset for folks. And so that may have an impact on resale supply. <br/>Good news for us is our focus for the last couple of years has been building out a much more robust new product pipeline, which today sits close to $1 billion. And we're really excited about that product as it's coming into our portfolio, both this year and years beyond. I think the resale environment has been limited the last 3 to 4 years. <br/>It hasn't really been a source of truth for people as they're trying to build up, call it, their base. Fortunately, for us, we have real scale in markets. I think where we may see other opportunities down the road this year could be as we see some of these smaller operators who are having trouble getting scale or sizing up, there could be opportunities where potential M&amp;A over the next couple of years. So I think we'll stay aggressive in our new product pipeline. We're obviously always looking at things as the resale market changes, but just being ready. And I think we're in a position to do that.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc.",
			"<strong>Austin Todd Wurschmidt</strong>",
			"I'm just curious if you guys are surprised at all by the strength in new lease rate growth year-to-date, which you highlighted has accelerated each month and surpassed renewals in April. And I'm just wondering if that enables you to pull back a bit on renewals to limit turnover and help control costs. And if you could provide an update on loss to lease, that would be helpful as well.",
			"<strong>Charles D. Young</strong>",
			"Yes. This is Charles. Thanks for the question. Yes, look, we've seen really healthy demand here in the first quarter. And while we expected it to be solid, it's a little bit out ahead of our expectations, which is great. The funnel is strong. We've been able to grow occupancy by 50 basis points from 97.3% to 97.8%, while, as you mentioned, accelerating new lease rent growth renewals still have been really strong. <br/>We've been in the mid-7s, and that's slightly above where we thought we'd be, and we're maintaining that in April in the 7s. And as you look forward, May and June, we went out in the mid-7s on our (inaudible), and we'll see where that ends up. You're asking the right question, there is a balance here as we're seeing this demand. And trying to balance off the lease compliance backlog that we're working through to make sure that we maintain strong occupancy. <br/>But right now, we like our kind of balance that we have, the optimization and demand to catch up when we do turn over a home because we are slightly up on turnover, but historically, really low numbers still in the 22% so where we are -- we'll see how the summer plays out. We're slightly ahead of expectations and optimistic going into the summer. <br/>And then the last question around loss to lease. We're in that -- as we updated it today, about 5% to 6% loss to lease.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo.",

			"I was hoping you could talk more about the expense side of your outlook. Any of the moving pieces that maybe you have a little bit less confidence in, whether it's insurance, taxes, utilities, anything R&amp;M, anything else we might want to think about here as the year unfolds? And also when you -- if you can give a date for when you did or you will renegotiate your insurance for the year?",
			"<strong>Jonathan S. Olsen</strong>",
			"Sure. Thanks for the question. This is Jon. Our insurance policy period runs from March to February. So we have now put our new insurance policy in place. <br/>Recall that on our last call, we talked about our expectation for the property policy being up somewhere in the neighborhood of 20% to 25% year-over-year. <br/>The actual policy came in right in the middle of that range, actually a little bit closer to the bottom end. <br/>And as we've talked about in the past, the other insurance line items showed smaller year-over-year increases. <br/>So our expectation for the balance of the year is that for the next 3 quarters, we'll see the insurance line item be up in the neighborhood of 20% year-over-year. And then for the full year, we'd expect insurance to be up about 16% year-over-year.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.",
			"<strong>Bradley Barrett Heffern</strong>",
			"On the property tax front, I noticed that it was down 3% from the fourth quarter. Can you talk about what that's related to? Is it lower appraisals or appeal wins? Or is there something else going on there?",
			"<strong>Jonathan S. Olsen</strong>",
			"Actually, no. So recall that, last year, in the fourth quarter, we talked about having been under accrued for property taxes in the first part of 2022. And so we had a fairly sizable catch-up entry in the fourth quarter. So what you can expect to see this year is much higher year-over-year property tax increases in the first 3 quarters of the year and then moderating in the fourth quarter. And we've said that we expect property taxes to be up in the range of 6.5% to 7.5% for the full year.",

			"Your next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.",
			"<strong>Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste</strong>",
			"First, congrats to Jon and Charles for new roles. And Ernie, I guess (inaudible) you'll be missed. Dallas, I want to go back to your comments earlier on -- I think you mentioned you're working to find a responsible way to help add more supply. I'm curious if you can elaborate on what that means. Are you inclined to do more development partnerships or even do it on balance sheet? And if I could sneak in one? Can you comment on the new SEC increase on Page 55 of the 10-K, the inquiry into your compliance with building codes and permitting requirements?",
			"<strong>Dallas B. Tanner</strong>",
			"Thanks, Haendel. I'll comment briefly on your last, which is we don't comment on any other legal matters other than to say that we always fully cooperate with any inquiries we get. <br/>In terms of new product pipeline and the opportunities there. Today, we've been really cautious and careful around not putting the balance sheet in a position where we'd have to take maybe more of an egregious share of the risk in terms of how we want to build product. We really like our approach thus far. We are doing a lot of different underwrites and reviews on opportunities in the marketplace across a variety of builders and develop potential partners. <br/>It's well noted that we have a really good partnership with Pulte Homes. We'll continue to do as much with Pulte as we can. They've been terrific. And I would say that with the announcement of that partnership, what, roughly 18, 24 months ago, it's expanded to many other builders and developers coming to us looking for opportunities to grow together. So we've been able to be deliberate. <br/>We've been able to be picky about where we want to invest and why. <br/>And I think we've been able to do it at a risk basis that is very variable to our shareholders in terms of not having an outsized portion of risk, a bunch of land sitting on our balance sheet, et cetera. <br/>And by the way, I'd just add, like very little G&amp;A. It's synonymous with our investment management team here. We've added a couple of people over time on the (inaudible) side and also on the project management side, but it's going really well, and we're coming into these homes a really accretive basis that we feel good about. Excited to see where that continued chapter for our company develops and has greater magnitude.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley.",
			"<strong>Adam Kramer</strong>",
			"And best wishes to Ernie. I appreciate all the help over the years. I just wanted to ask about bad debt on kind of a gross and net basis. Maybe just kind of walk us through how gross bad debt in 1Q compared to 4Q and then maybe the same for net. And then the areas where geographic areas, markets where you're still kind of worse than pre-COVID levels on kind of that gross bad debt line. Maybe just kind of highlight for us which markets are kind of still outliers on that basis?",
			"<strong>Ernest M. Freedman</strong>",
			"Yes. With regard to -- this is Ernie. With regards to bad debt, we saw that our rent assistance that we received from the fourth quarter, the first quarter actually got cut in half. And so what's happening is that we're seeing a good pick up. And you can see what we reported in our earnings supplemental that for the first time in a while that 0 to 30 payment is increasing and got to 93%. So we're actually seeing a nice improvement in the gross bad debt and not getting as much help from things like [rent assistance] as we expected. <br/>And in fact, the collections coming forward in the 0 to 30 bucket were a little bit better than we had anticipated. And we're able to clean up a little bit more than we anticipated in the first quarter, hence, we made the reference in our earnings release, that things came in a little bit better than we expected for the first part of the year, and that certainly bodes well. <br/>But it's early, too. So we don't want to call it a trend yet, but we're certainly happy with where it's at, not only for the first 3 months of the year, but for the first 4 months of the year. <br/>I'll turn it over to Charles and he can talk a little bit about what we're seeing on a market-by-market basis.",
			"<strong>Charles D. Young</strong>",
			"Yes. So as Ernie said, we're starting to see kind of a return to normal and all trends are generally positive. And this is why rent assistance has gone, about half of last quarter and 20% year-over-year. So we're starting to get back into a normal rhythm. <br/>In terms of markets, about half of our markets are operating at their historic levels, which are great. There are a few markets that because of kind of the lease compliance, backlog in the courts and that it's a little slower, SoCal being kind of the largest of that. But the L.A. County, L.A. City adjustment is favorable, and we'll see how that plays out. There's still kind of the -- the courts are backlog there. So it will take a little bit of time to clean up. The other markets that are a little slower are Atlanta, Vegas, but that's changing and adjusting quickly in NorCal, [Vista], California courts as well. <br/>Then we have another handful of markets that are trending in the right direction, but not quite back to historical levels. So -- we feel like we're moving in the right direction and things are kind of working themselves out. And as we talked about on the last call, we knew bad debt was going to be elevated in the first half of the year. And we're trending nicely, and we'll see if we can continue to keep that momentum. And by the second half, we'll be trending back towards where we want to be in cleaning this up.",

			"Your next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street.",
			"<strong>John Joseph Pawlowski</strong>",
			"Dallas, I want to circle back to the qui tam lawsuit. I know your views haven't changed where you do not think it has merit. But curious if the internal views have changed at all when trying to size the potential impact, if you're wrong and things go south in court. So can you help us give us a sense of whether your views have changed on the potential financial impact for shareholders?",
			"<strong>Dallas B. Tanner</strong>",
			"No change in our views. And again, we're really careful guys. We don't want to comment on any pending litigation -- but no, it's just the same, John. <br/>And we'll continue to defend ourselves vigorously, and we believe that the claim is really without merit.",

			"<strong>Daniel Peter Tricarico</strong>",
			"Question on the builder pipeline. It looks as though some of the 2023 and '24 deliveries were pushed out to the following year with the recent release. Can you comment on the different components driving that?",
			"<strong>Dallas B. Tanner</strong>",
			"It's just timing on projects more or less than anything. I think, by and large, everything that we expected to take from a delivery perspective this year is on schedule and then some of it has to do with timing in [P&amp;C] and some of the zoning commission things that we mentioned in my earlier comments.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from the line of Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research. My apologies. Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.",
			"<strong>Juan Carlos Sanabria</strong>",
			"Just curious if you could speak a little bit more on the acquisition side. Are you seeing any potential distress from some larger portfolio owners given the change in rates and some financing may be coming due. <br/>And as part of that question, maybe if you can just comment on where you see cap rates today for assets that are transacting and how does that compare to your implied cap rate thinking about your own cost of capital?",
			"<strong>Dallas B. Tanner</strong>",
			"Hi Juan. Dallas. First, on balance sheet, we don't really love our current cost of capital. And it feels like on a real estate basis that our current cost of capital is not truly being valued where it should be. I would say, and we haven't been shy about saying this, that we'll continue to look to expand our joint venture business and raise outside capital, we can still buy really good real estate, both new product, resell product and I guess, potentially, you could say M&amp;A, to your question. <br/>And it's terrific for the REIT. It created a bunch of fee structures, promotes and things that ultimately, is FFO and AFFO drip for shareholders. It feels like the market today is on a new home basis, if you really wanted to buy volume, you're kind of in the low to mid-5s would be kind of on an in-place stabilized cap rate. <br/>I will go back to the earlier question, which is there aren't a lot of meaningful opportunities there in the resale space. And I don't think we've seen as much as people have wanted to think that residential was going to implode over the last year, we've seen really good price stability on the single-family housing side on a relative basis because it was mentioned today in the Journal, new home construction is making up about 1/3 of the resale market, which is about 50% higher than where it typically is -- in any given year. <br/>And so homebuilders have done a nice job of helping support a transaction market in a way because they've been able to buy down mortgage rates and things like that. So not seeing a lot of distress from operators. I do think there could be moments of opportunity because if you don't have enough scale, if you don't have a significant portfolio today, I don't want to say that they're stuck but it's going to be harder to grow. I think scale is going to be more beneficial over the next couple of years, and it should benefit companies like ours in the REIT space where we have very low leverage and generally access and availability to different capital -- buckets of capital. <br/>And I think we have a good track record here over the last 12 years of finding ways to meaningfully grow and those opportunities in front of us. So like I mentioned in my opening remarks, like we feel like we're ready. We've got between, call it, current cash and ventures and availability of credit. We've got a couple of billion dollars of dry powder. We want to lean in when the right opportunities are in front of us. And right now, it's just been more of a capital recycling period.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from the line of Keegan Carl with Wolfe Research.",
			"<strong>Keegan Grant Carl</strong>",
			"Just on your JV dispositions, what was the driver? And what was the average cap rate and what was sold?",
			"<strong>Dallas B. Tanner</strong>",
			"On the JV disposition, is the question?",
			"<strong>Ernest M. Freedman</strong>",
			"All the JV dispositions -- this is Ernie. The JV dispositions are from our legacy Fannie Mae joint venture. And the plan for that joint venture over the next many years is slowly dispose homes as they -- for the most part, when they're not renewing. And so you're just going to continue to see -- I'll call it, a drip of sales each quarter as they go forward. For other JVs, we just finished the investment period for the 2020 Rockpoint JV. So we're far off from doing any sales there. <br/>For the 2022 Rockpoint JV, we're still in the investment period there. And with regards to what we've been selling at Fannie Mae you see it's a small number, it's consistent what we have on the balance sheet.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman &amp; Associates.",
			"<strong>Dennis Patrick McGill</strong>",
			"Dallas, I guess just going back to the transaction market, I'd be interested in what you think breaks the stalemate because you're sitting here with a cap rate that's not all that attractive, but fundamentals are good. You're able to sell at an easy cap rate, attractive cap rate. It doesn't sound like inventory is going to be coming to market with a lock-in effect. So other than the long end of the curve coming down and debt costs coming down, which probably brings with it some economic challenges. What changes the confidence of everybody out there to just transact that this is the new norm?",
			"<strong>Dallas B. Tanner</strong>",
			"Well, I think, one, you want to have yields that make sense, right? I don't think you want to see -- I don't think our shareholders would want us to necessarily be super active buying yields that aren't very accretive. I also think that there's going to be -- and look, you mentioned a stalemate. To be fair, the last year has been sort of tricky. I think it's been tricky for private operators that are considering recaps or financing activities, et cetera. <br/>I think that will spur some opportunities for us. I also think we've got the right approach with our new product pipeline where those deliveries are going to start to stack at pretty meaningful yields even at today's current cost of capital. So I think the opportunity will sort of play itself through the marketplace as either one of a handful of things happen. Your point on the long side of the curve comes in and credit availability maybe helps enhance some transaction activities, you see more in the resale space. <br/>But I also believe that the combination of our new product pipeline, potential M&amp;A being a bit more active in the resale space as that starts to normalize, will all lend itself to pretty normalized years for activity. It makes sense to me that a lot of single-family rental operators, you've read it kind of everywhere else have all taken a pause. We want to see what happens with housing prices. I think people are wanting to make sure that there's stability and price durability in the marketplace. It feels like it's there. And I think now it's just about identifying and executing on those opportunities.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore.",
			"<strong>Stephen Thomas Sakwa</strong>",
			"I think Charles had provided maybe the April renewal. I'm just curious if I missed it. Did you talk about where renewals were going out for May and June? And -- maybe secondly, could you just maybe comment on some of the larger occupancy drops like Las Vegas? And I guess, what are you seeing in some of the markets where the occupancy drop more than the portfolio average?",
			"<strong>Charles D. Young</strong>",
			"Yes. Great question. I did share where we went on in renewals earlier. For May, we went out in the mid-7s and June kind of mid- to high 7s. And we expect that to be kind of steady where we're going right now. Given the demand and kind of where we are with the current occupancy, we're in healthy shape. <br/>To your other question, Vegas, I mentioned it earlier when we were talking about the lease compliance. It's one of those markets that was having some bad debt challenges and that the backlog is starting to break there. And so you're getting a little bit of a spike in turnover. And so as we clean that up, it's put some pressure on occupancy. The other kind of below average was in Minnesota. They had some earlier cleanup on the lease compliance over the winter. And you also have in the colder markets, some seasonality that hit them a little harder. So those are 2 markets that, again, high [96s] are not bad. And what we're starting to see is some increase in both of those markets as they go. So -- with the healthy demand that we're seeing, generally, we feel like we'll be able to kind of get to ship straight pretty quickly. The rest of the markets are running nicely in the high [97s or 98s].",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from the line of Sam Choe with Credit Suisse.",
			"<strong>Adam Paul Hamilton</strong>",
			"This is Adam on for Sam. I wanted to circle back quickly to the lease growth discussion. We were really encouraged by the lease acceleration, especially on the new lease side going to peak leasing season. I was wondering if you've seen anything driving that demand besides the demographic shifts you've already discussed. <br/>And adjacent to that, you mentioned some technology upgrades. Are there any new initiatives that could possibly help ancillary revenue on that side?",
			"<strong>Charles D. Young</strong>",
			"Yes. overall funnel is really strong. I mean I think as you look at it, the general demand for our product, given our location, schools, safety, all of that. The other thing that does stand out is purchased move-out reasons to purchase a home is down, the lowest it's been in a while. We're kind of balancing that with some of the turnover. But you look at current interest rates, it's natural that people will -- who need a single-family home are going to come to us. And -- that's what we're seeing. About 80% are rented prior and about 77% are coming from a single-family home prior to coming to us. And so all of that is trending in a positive direction and gives us kind of good demand. <br/>And as we looked at kind of how we were able to accelerate through Q1, it does, as you said, put us in a healthy position going into the summer. Our thought, as we looked at this and we kind of set our perspective is that you got to be realistic to where we were in the last couple of years. And while we're going into it maybe a little ahead of time, we do feel like there's going to be a peak here. <br/>It's not going to rise to the sky like we did during COVID. But we like our position, given our occupancy and the acceleration that we've seen to date. So we feel real good about it.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from the line of Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs.",
			"<strong>Unidentified Analyst</strong>",
			"This is (inaudible) on behalf of Chandni. So could you talk more about the turnover expense overall, especially on the resident turnover, like how much of it was from normal seasonality and inflation? And how much of it was impacted by working through the (inaudible) units in California? <br/>And what's your expectation on the growth for the rest of the year?",
			"<strong>Jonathan S. Olsen</strong>",
			"Thanks. Great question. This is Jon. Look, on turnover, there are a few factors that play here. The first is that you're seeing a year-over-year increase in turnover rate and that's related to what Charles walked through, which is the return of our markets to more normal course mechanisms related to delinquency resolution. <br/>The second component is that the average cost per turn on those delinquency turns, as we talked about on the last call, can be materially higher than a regular way turn, sometimes to the effect of 40% to 50% more costly, and it would follow that they are likely to also take a little bit longer. <br/>I think the other less influential factor is that, as Dallas talked about, with average length of stay elongating, you see a little bit more kind of normal wear and tear even in our regular way turns. But I think those are really the primary drivers coupled with continued inflationary pressure that we're seeing in our markets. <br/>As for the balance of the year, as we've talked about, we expect to see somewhat lower occupancy in 2023 than we did last year. That's primarily related to our expectation for a little bit higher turnover. And the expectation that it's going to take us a little bit of time to work our way through our lease compliance backlog. But I think big picture, we're very optimistic about how the business is performing.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from the line of Jade Rahmani with KBW.",
			"<strong>Jason Sabshon</strong>",
			"This is Jason Sabshon on for Jade. Does levering new investments make sense at this point? Or is it best to stay in levered and figure out financing later on?",
			"<strong>Dallas B. Tanner</strong>",
			"Look, I can defer some of this is Jon. But I would say we really like where our leverage profile is. We've worked hard to get it to a level where on a risk-adjusted basis, we're far better than we were 5 years ago when the business went public. I think we've used more leverage in some of our ventures. And that's sort of been by design, and we've been programmatic and thoughtful about how to do that and when to do it. But I think, by and large, the cost to debt out there isn't that great right now even for an unsecured borrower like ourselves. So I don't see leverage being a significant part of our near strategy to go fund our growth.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo.",
			"<strong>James Colin Feldman</strong>",
			"I guess I just wanted to get your thoughts on NOI margins. I mean year-over-year, they're clearly down in most markets sequentially, they've a little bit more mix but definitely picked up for the portfolio overall. I mean, how do you see this trending through the course of the year or even beyond now that you've got a better handle on the expense side, especially with insurance and taxes. And a pretty good view on revenue as well.",
			"<strong>Jonathan S. Olsen</strong>",
			"Yes, I think it's a good question. We're seeing a little bit elevated expense here in the first 3 quarters of this year for all the reasons we've talked about previously. And that's going to put a little bit of pressure on margin for us, at least for the first 3 quarters of 2023. <br/>I think over the long term, what you've seen from our business is sort of a steady improvement in NOI margin over time as we're able to extract more and more efficiencies in terms of how our property management platform operates, continue to harvest the benefits of our unrivaled scale in markets. So I think we continue to be bullish about our ability to drive NOI margin higher over the long term.",

			"I just have one follow-up on the turnover and repair and maintenance conversation. Jon, so far this year and starting out in the spring and summer this trajectory of R&amp;M and turnover trending in line, better or worse than you originally expected heading into this year?",
			"<strong>Jonathan S. Olsen</strong>",
			"I think they're trending generally in line with what we've expected. I think overall, we're performing relatively well, maybe a little bit ahead of our expectations for the year, but it's early in the year, right? So we want to continue to see how things develop. But I would say that we feel good about what we're seeing on the cost to maintain side of things.",

			"Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citibank.",
			"<strong>Nicholas Gregory Joseph</strong>",
			"It's actually Nick Joseph here for Eric. One of your Sunbelt or one of the Sunbelt [Apartment] Companies mentioned on their call that (inaudible) come down about 60% from current levels. So wondering kind of historically, when you've seen big swings in apartment deliveries, what's the impact on single-family rental operations?",
			"<strong>Dallas B. Tanner</strong>",
			"It's an interesting question. We haven't seen a lot of it, and there's sort of 2 things on there. One, our customers are a little bit different. I mentioned, duration of stay and Charles talked about it as well that we have customers that are anchoring around schools and transportation quarters. So the customer profile is a little bit different. And then on a price per square foot, SFR is so much more affordable, generally speaking, than comparative multifamily. So it's really not an apples-to-apples comparison.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from the line of Michael Gorman with BTIG.",
			"<strong>Michael Patrick Gorman</strong>",
			"Sorry if I missed it, but I just wanted to double check. I know you maintained your operating guidance for the full year for operating expenses. Should we expect any kind of outsized impact in the second quarter just because of some of the extreme weather we've seen, especially in some of like the Florida market? Does that change how you're thinking about the progression of operating expenses throughout the year, even within the maintained guidance?",
			"<strong>Jonathan S. Olsen</strong>",
			"No, I don't think we're anticipating a material impact related to weather patterns. I think right now, -- what we're seeing in the business is a business that is sort of recalibrating as some of the structural impediments to us operating the way we normally would work themselves out over time. I think weather is something that we are always going to have to deal with. I think we feel good about the processes we have in place, the ground game that we roll out to make sure that we are protecting our assets and that we're well insured in the event of some sort of catastrophic events. But I would say that the impact is not expected to be significant.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays.",
			"<strong>Anthony Franklin Powell</strong>",
			"Question on Phoenix and Tampa. I think 2 markets that people were concerned about given a lot of the supply growth both on the multifamily and the single-family side. You're seeing very strong rent growth there. So maybe comment on those 2 markets.",
			"<strong>Charles D. Young</strong>",
			"Yes. This is Charles. I can jump in. Yes, Tampa has been really strong for us. It's new lease rent growth of north of 8% in Q1 and maintaining on the renewal side in the mid-8. Phoenix, while Q4 was a little down relative to the kind of high flying we had last year. <br/>You can see it's quickly kind of bounced back and we're at the 98% occupancy and new lease rent growth at 6.3%. And so in our top 5 as we look at the numbers. So to your point, it's one of the -- Phoenix is a resilient market and we were able to bounce back, and we have great operators there, so in Tampa as well. So 2 strong markets for us as we look at it, most of Florida has been really strong. The demand is really there as we think about demographic changes.",

			"Thank you, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. Let me start today by telling you how I tend to spend my Saturday mornings Espresso in hand. First, I grab the FT, the old-fashioned print edition, to see what Katie Martin has to say about the state of the equity and credit markets in her Long View column. Katie can be very funny with the long and short of it is that the market participants she's quoting these days aren't having a lot of fun.<br/>Then I might grab my iPad and catch up on any of Rob Armstrong's Unhedged FT columns that I fell behind on during the prior week. Rob's response to current and prospective market conditions is rather Hamlet in character: to be or not to be, to be a bull or to be a bear or to be neither. But who is he who is neither bull nor bear? That is the question.<br/>In my second Espresso, I might see with the 2 Michaels and 1 Marco, among others, have had to offer a market commentary and forecasting in the prior few days, Hartnett, Wilson, Kolonovic. I could call them the 3 archdukes of doom, but that would be unfair. Well, actually not that unfair. And if these folks are formulating a rational response to the current state of the macro economy, monetary and fiscal policy and the markets. Visibility is low. Uncertainty is high.<br/>In commercial real estate, asset pricing is murky and/or subject to dispute between would be sellers and would be buyers. As a result, there's not a whole lot of trading going on. Commercial real estate trading was down nearly 70% year-over-year in March 2023. And it's not like March 2022 was a barn burner for real estate assets or portfolio trading. What does all this uncertainty and low visibility mean for how we're thinking and what we're doing at VICI? Our thinking and doing starts with our current state of earnings growth and investment activity. As you saw on last night's VICI earnings release, for Q1 2023, we generated year-over-year AFFO growth of 18.6% per share, a rate that we believe will be among the highest for REITs generally and S&amp;P 500 REITs specifically.<br/>And to take a broader view, so far in earnings season, year-over-year Q1 2023 earnings growth for S&amp;P 500 companies of all kinds is running at negative 4% versus VICI's Q1 AFFO growth a gain at 18.6%. But it's not only about growth in current earnings, it's about growing our future earnings. Along that line and even amidst this murky trading environment, within Q1, we allocated a total of $1.6 billion of incremental capital to compelling and accretive experiential property and lending investments, which John will have more detail on in a moment. And even with that $1.6 billion of capital having been newly allocated in Q1, we have approximately $859 million of equity dry powder, thanks to our unsettled forward equity and approximately $650 million in cash.<br/>Combined that with $2.4 billion of undrawn revolver capacity, and we have the funding in place to seize on further opportunity if opportunity presents itself in this current environment. Most of all, during an uncertain time like this, we keep doing what we've done at VICI from the beginning. We are always working on our future, growing relationships that have the potential to grow our business. These relationships don't have to turn into deals tomorrow, as John has noted in the past.<br/>In that vein, think about the fact that the AFFO growth VICI expects to reduce in 2023 is in good measure. The result of relationship building we did many years ago with those who would end up being our partners in our Venetian and MGP transaction, which we announced in 2021. Thus, it is, to reiterate, that much of the work we are doing at VICI in 2023 is about growth in 2024, 2025 and beyond. And yet I don't mean to suggest that we are not jumping on immediate opportunities when these opportunities are compelling, as evidenced again by the $1.6 billion of capital we newly deployed in Q1 2023.<br/>Finally, we are working intensely in the present and for our future with one of the lowest G&amp;A loads in American triple net REIT management as a percentage of revenues or of assets. Think of our G&amp;A as a form of asset management free. Our asset management fee understood in this way, as measured by VICI corporate G&amp;A, runs at about 0.1% of assets under management. That's a fee load you would expect from a passive manager of an index fund. With VICI for 0.1%, you get very active investment management that has historically produced significant outperformance.<br/>I'll now turn the call to John so that he can share with you what kind of activities we have been up to and are up to. John?",
			"<strong>John W. R. Payne</strong>",
			"Thanks, Ed. Good morning to everyone. Ed quoted Shakespeare's Hamlet when describing current market conditions. So I thought it would be appropriate to quote another great, Ted Lasso, when describing how the VICI team has functioned through the last 5 years of a rather volatile market. Lasso said, \"The harder you work, the luckier you get.\"<br/>We saw the results of that work come together in 2022, which was a transformational year for VICI in which we doubled our size and scale, becoming one of the largest triple net REITs. 2023, as Ed just noted, is the year in which we are laying the groundwork for VICI's next phase of expansion domestically and globally across gaming and many other experiential sectors. In the first quarter, VICI closed on its first international transaction with pure Canadian gaming in Alberta, Canada, one of Canada's top gaming markets. We are thrilled that our first international transaction was in Canada as we believe the Canadian gaming industry presents a great opportunity for VICI as it is an established industry with many similarities to the U.S. gaming industry.<br/>This transaction will be the first of many international investments that the VICI team continues to explore across the globe. We also completed the acquisition of the remaining 49.9% stake in our Mandalay Bay/MGM Grand joint venture with Blackstone. This real estate consolidation was a great example of our high functioning partnership with Blackstone as we both accomplished important goals with this transaction, and VICI now owns 100% of 2 additional Class A resorts on the Las Vegas Strip.<br/>To spend a moment on Las Vegas. In February, over 4 million people traveled through Harry Reid Airport for the first time ever, which is 25% above February of 2022. Our operating partners continue to set all-time records and volumes in all segments continue to remain strong. Our operating partners continue to see very strong hotel occupancy and are also experiencing a nice recovery in the group and convention business. These strong operating numbers are the result of tremendous innovation and capital deployment by our tenants and their work is making Las Vegas the gaming, sports and entertainment capital of the world. <br/>We're also proud to expand our relationship with Travel Nations, adding Cherokee Nation businesses of Oklahoma to our tenant roster as they enter into the lease agreement related to the Gold Strike Casino and Resort in Tunica, Mississippi. We are also supporting our partners at Hard Rock in the redevelopment of Hard Rock Ottawa in Canada by purchasing a portion of the senior secured notes funding this exciting new project.<br/>The American tribal nations are some of the best gaming operators, and we look forward to continue to find ways to help support their growth as they expand in the commercial gaming across the country. Within nongaming experiential industries, the team is intensely studying sectors we believe fit well with our VICI investment criteria. We continue to meet and build relationship with owners and operators in many sectors, including health and wellness, youth, collegiate and professional sports, various forms of family entertainment, theme parks, holiday parks and other destination-based experiences.<br/>The team is forging foundational relationships with the market leaders who have ambitions to grow and see VICI as a preferred capital partner for their businesses, similar to those we helped, Cabot Golf and Canyon Ranch. For this quarter, we expanded our indoor water park presence with our fourth loan to Great Wolf lodge to fund the development of their location in Connecticut and in partnership with the Foxwoods Resort.<br/>The VICI team will make the most of this year by continuing to build a pipeline of partnerships that we believe will help us achieve our future growth goals, while at the same time expecting to deliver at least 10% of AFFO per share growth in 2023. As you've observed over the past 5 years, our team does not rest very often as we're laser-focused on building the highest quality experiential REIT in the world. <br/>Now I will turn the call over to David, who will discuss our financial results. David?",
			"<strong>David Andrew Kieske</strong>",
			"Thanks, John. 2023 started off with several very exciting transactions. Our ability to move quickly and close these acquisitions at the start of the year as a result of the liquidity we have maintained and balance sheet that we have built over the years in an effort to be nimble and act on attractive opportunities as they come before us. We will continue to focus on the balance sheet as it is important to ensure that we have a capital structure designed to weather all cycles and provide the safety and protection our equity and credit partners deserve.<br/>As John mentioned, we closed on the acquisition of the 4 PURE Canadian Gaming assets in Alberta, Canada, the 49.9% interest we previously did not own in the MGM Grand Mandalay Bay JV. And we purchased $85 million of senior secured notes issued by Hard Rock Ottawa LP. This is an exciting transaction for VICI as we partnered with a large financial institution to provide Hard Rock with a complete financing solution for the redevelopment of what will become the Hard Rock Ottawa in Canada.<br/>In addition, we announced a $287.9 million construction loan for the development of a Great Wolf lodge, which sits on land owned by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation next to the Foxwoods Resort Casino. This transaction represents our fourth loan with Great Wolf for a total capital commitment of approximately $550 million to support Great Wolf's development pipeline.<br/>In January, we bolstered our liquidity raising approximately $965 million of available net equity proceeds through the sale of 30.3 million shares via forward sale agreements. On April 4, we physically settled 3.2 million of these shares for net proceeds of approximately $101.5 million. As we sit here today, we have approximately $3.9 billion in total liquidity, As Ed mentioned, this is comprised of approximately $650 million in cash, $859 million of net proceeds available from the January forward sale agreements and $2.4 billion of availability under the revolving credit facility.<br/>In terms of the leverage, our total debt is currently $17.1 billion, which reflects the consolidation of the full $3 billion of CMBS debt that encumbers the MGM Grand Mandalay Bay JV. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA is approximately 5.7x today. We have a weighted average interest rate of 4.34%, taking into account our hedge portfolio and a weighted average 6.6 years to maturity.<br/>Turning to the income statement. AFFO was $528.6 million for the quarter, an increase of 73% over Q1 2022. AFFO per share was $0.53 for the quarter, an increase of 18.6% compared to the $0.44 for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. As a reminder, the disparity between our overall AFFO growth and AFFO per share growth is due to an increase in our share count, which increased primarily from equity raised and shares issued to fund our acquisition of the MGM Grand at Mandalay Bay JV this quarter and to consummate our acquisitions of MGP during Q2 and the Venetian resort during Q1 of last year.<br/>Our results once again highlight our highly efficient triple net model given the significant increase in adjusted EBITDA as a proportion of the corresponding increase in revenue and our margins continue to run strong in the high 90% range when eliminating noncash items. Our G&amp;A was $15 million for the quarter and as a percentage of total revenues was only 1.7%, in line with our full year expectations and one of the lowest ratios in the triple-net sector.<br/>Turning to guidance. We are reaffirming AFFO guidance for 2023 in both absolute dollars as well as on a per share basis. AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2023, is expected to be between $2.115 billion and $2.155 billion or between $2.10 and $2.13 per diluted common share. Our guidance does not include the impact on operating results from any announced but unclosed transactions, interest income from any loans that do not yet have final draw schedules, possible future acquisitions or dispositions, capital markets activity or other nonrecurring transactions. <br/>As a reminder, we recorded noncash CECL charge on a quarterly basis, which due to its inherent unpredictability, leaves us unable to forecast net income and FFO with accuracy. Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments and evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends.<br/>With that, Elliott, please open the line for questions.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan.",
			"<strong>Anthony Paolone</strong>",
			"My first question relates to your discussion around building relationships for the future pipeline. And so I was wondering if you can comment on whether or not there's a certain type of deal size that's emerging as a sweet spot for the different things you're looking at or even a region perhaps in the world where sort of the deal flow seems to be pointing.",
			"<strong>Edward Baltazar Pitoniak</strong>",
			"Yes, (inaudible)",
			"<strong>John W. R. Payne</strong>",
			"Do you want me to take that?",
			"<strong>Edward Baltazar Pitoniak</strong>",
			"Well, John, I just want to -- sorry, can you hear me now? If not, go ahead.",
			"<strong>John W. R. Payne</strong>",
			"We can hear you, Ed.",
			"<strong>Edward Baltazar Pitoniak</strong>",
			"Yes, I was just going to say, Tony, I apologize for that. When we work on relationships, we're obviously working on new ones all the time. But we also work very hard to make sure our existing relationships are strong and productive -- mutually productive as they can be. And thus, we were rather honored that Jonathan Halkyard, the CFO at MGM, may referenced in his earnings call last night to VICI being a fantastic partner of ours. So that's a very big focus in terms of where future growth can come from, which is to say with our existing tenants.<br/>But in terms of the other relationships we're building, I'll turn it over to John. John?",
			"<strong>John W. R. Payne</strong>",
			"Yes. Tony, I won't go into specifics about the relationships we're building. We are studying the industry, countries around the world. But I just use -- we've been asked since we started the company about when we look at something that's the size and how small. I mean, I'll just use the example of a Century game we did one deal. We then announced the deal in Maryland with them. And we're just -- hopefully, over time, we'll continue to build that relationship.<br/>So we really think that there are times that a smaller deal by itself may \"look small,\" but over the lifetime of a partnership or a relationship, that will get larger. And so we are chalking up miles, meeting folks face to face and traveling the world to find opportunities for our company and for our shareholders that are accretive.",
			"<strong>Anthony Paolone</strong>",
			"Okay. And John, just as a follow-up maybe. Capital markets have been volatile over the last few months or quarters. Like can you maybe give us a sense as to what the brackets are on yields for the things you're considering right now?",
			"<strong>John W. R. Payne</strong>",
			"Well, that would have been an easier question back 5 years ago, I think, Tony, when we were just looking at gaming opportunities domestically. We could probably take the rest of the call as we look at different sectors. But I'll let David talk about how thoughtful we are in understanding our cost of capital and getting spreads when we're making investments or creating term sheets. But we're looking at a wide variety of sectors, countries in gaming and non-gaming. So David, do you want to touch a little bit on that as well?",
			"<strong>David Andrew Kieske</strong>",
			"Yes, happy to, John. And Tony, good to talk to yet. I mean, as you saw during the quarter, we partnered with a large financial institution and put out some capital at an 11% rate. I'm not here to say that every deal we're going to do is going to be 11%. But we are focused on a blended spread to our cost of capital, and we've -- our share price has held in our financing costs, just to get ahead of that question, is for a 10-year piece of paper is probably right around 6% today.<br/>So we're very cognizant of deploying capital on a risk-adjusted basis that generates spread investing over the time while adding just phenomenal -- real estate phenomenal relationships and growth partners like we've done in the past with Cabot and Canyon. And we're confident there's more to come.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Smedes Rose from Citi.",
			"<strong>Nicholas Gregory Joseph</strong>",
			"It's actually Nick up here with Smedes. Maybe following up on that last comment. How do you think about the competitiveness of your cost of capital relative to more traditional sources of capital as you look to deploy it?",
			"<strong>Edward Baltazar Pitoniak</strong>",
			"And Nick, good to hear from you. By traditional sorts of capital, are you referring to the debt and equity financing available to the asset controller?",
			"<strong>Nicholas Gregory Joseph</strong>",
			"Exactly.",
			"<strong>Edward Baltazar Pitoniak</strong>",
			"Yes. So clearly, a lot of the experiential landscape is made up of operators who tend to be high-yield credits. And as you well know, the high-yield market has been really quite dormant for quite a while now, going well into -- well back into last year and continuing into this year. <br/>So the access to credit is somewhat limited and the cost of it obviously has widened. And the cost of equity for many of them has at best on sideways. So as we look at the maturity walls that many debtors are facing 2024, 2025 and onward, we do think, as we talked about in the past, that we can be a virtuous source of funding through sale-leaseback structures when it comes to either refinancing debt or perhaps even more compellingly financing expansion for good operators who may have expansion opportunities, roll-up opportunities in the next few years should other operators come under any kind of refinancing pressure.",
			"<strong>Nicholas Gregory Joseph</strong>",
			"And then just on international expansion. Obviously, Canada is generally pretty similar to the U.S. But as you think about other kind of further expansion, how do you think about pricing regulatory and political risk from different geographies or countries?",
			"<strong>Edward Baltazar Pitoniak</strong>",
			"David?",
			"<strong>David Andrew Kieske</strong>",
			"Yes. Thanks, Ed. Nick, good to talk to you. We're spending time across the globe looking where there -- where others have gone and where there's REIT friendly jurisdictions, favorable tax regimes, favorable political regimes, favorable currency, favorable funding markets. So you're absolutely right. I mean as we spent time in Canada and got our training wheels on, so to speak, with Canada, we -- the team developed a lot of institutional learning and list a lot of institutional knowledge around how to set up structures, how to set up minimize tax leakage and ensure that we have the right protection for our income that we will potentially generate abroad.<br/>And so it goes into the black box, so to speak, and we would need to make sure that we generate significant spreads to that -- to the cost of capital because there is tax leakage. There is some risk. And so not every deal is the same. But we'll make sure that we are partnering with the right folks and underwriting the credit and the real estate quality and the future earnings growth of these potential opportunities that may come abroad.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from David Katz from Jefferies.",
			"<strong>David Brian Katz</strong>",
			"Look, I think we've talked to a bunch of our companies so far. All of them over the past several months, looking for some perspective that may indicate some kind of a turn in the consumer economy or in the business economy. And I think you may have a unique perspective because you stay close to your tenants. And I just wonder what you're hearing and seeing. I know John travels around quite a bit. He was engaged on the gaming side. But if there's anything outside of gaming that we can talk about, what is your sort of economic view?",
			"<strong>Edward Baltazar Pitoniak</strong>",
			"Yes. Well, I'll turn it over to John just to reiterate the strength we're seeing in gaming. But we can say, for example, that our partners at businesses like Cabot, like Canyon Ranch, like Great Wolf are seeing -- continuing to see very, very strong demand. Some of it, David, is obviously the COVID pent-up demand factor still exercising itself. But as you've heard us talk about in the past, we also believe we're seeing the evidence of the secular trends we've talked about at VICI, which is aging baby boomers moving into years in which they have more leisure time and millennials moving into family formation, which is obviously benefiting a business like Great Wolf.<br/>So I think, David and John, it's fair to say that our non-gaming operators are feeling -- everybody is confident in their outlooks as we are hearing and seeing gaming. Correct, John and David?",
			"<strong>John W. R. Payne</strong>",
			"Yes, absolutely. And I couldn't agree more with that. I did want to take the opportunity because David asked about Las Vegas operators and are staying in touch with them as well as our regional operators. David, we're very blessed we now today have 11 tenants, right? And so we get a really good view of the entire industry, and our tenants are willing to do what we would call informal reviews with us on a quarterly basis to share with us their views on how things are going. And it's not in our leases. They do this because we form these partnerships, and it helps us better have discussions about how we can help them to grow. <br/>But across the gaming sector, I mean, it's really amazing to hear the results, MGM released yesterday or earlier today, 36% growth in same-store adjusted EBITDAR, right, in Las Vegas. And that's an incredible number. So when I do these meetings with our team, we ask the question, where are you seeing slowness in your business, in your operating business? And there's very little slowness in any of the sectors. In fact, there's still growth in almost all of them. <br/>So it's a really interesting business, and forward bookings are still robust in Las Vegas. And then the regional markets continue to show steadiness across many of their sectors. And so it's exciting to have these partners who continue to innovate, continue to deploy capital. Many of them have seen a really nice return on the capital that they're deploying, whether it's new restaurants, fixing hotel rooms that needed upgrades, et cetera.",
			"<strong>David Brian Katz</strong>",
			"Understood. Appreciate it. And as my follow-up. Just reading this morning and following very closely, some of the more regional lenders out there that account for, according to some of the press, 80% of commercial real estate mortgages. Is there any strategy or a way for you to approach and position yourselves to participate productively and pools of smaller deals or anything like that, given the circumstances, is there some opportunity for you to get in there and become an alternative lender?",
			"<strong>Edward Baltazar Pitoniak</strong>",
			"It's a really good question, David, and we are digging into it and need to dig into it deeper. I would say that based on what we've seen so far, regional banks in their commercial real estate lending are generally lending to asset categories like office, like multi-res and other categories, retail, that we won't invest in. So I'm not sure that there's a direct opportunity to get involved in categories that regional banking lenders have tended to focus on. But I do think there's an indirect opportunity in that we are seeing evidence, as is everyone, of further tightening of credit.<br/>So I do believe there is going to be enhanced opportunity for us. I'm not sure it's going to be directly from the tightening of credit by regional lenders to the conventional real estate asset classes. But I do think, David, we're very confident that we are already seeing, as evidenced by the work David and the team have done in Hard Rock Ottawa, Quantum Blue and other credit opportunities, that we're going to continue to see both enhanced credit opportunity and enhanced real estate acquisition opportunities because of the tightening for credit.<br/>David Kieske, anything to add? .",
			"<strong>David Andrew Kieske</strong>",
			"No, I think you touched on it perfectly. I echo that, that we are seeing opportunities to potentially lend capital. But when we think about our strategic lending book, we want to ensure it's with the right partners where it could lead to future growth opportunities. And I think at the regional level, less opportunity for us. But look, that will trickle up to the bigger banks, right? That will have an impact on JPMorgans and the BofAs and the Citis lending across the board, and so that could create opportunities for us around the experiential categories.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Todd Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets.",
			"<strong>Todd Michael Thomas</strong>",
			"First question, David. You mentioned that the company's incremental cost of debt today, I think, is around 6%. You said your cost of equity capital continues to improve and is in that range, depending on how you look at it, and the stock is up nearly 6% year-to-date, so that's improving. Does that change the way that you think about capitalizing new investments, vis-a-vis, rising debt costs in the near term?",
			"<strong>David Andrew Kieske</strong>",
			"Yes, Todd. Good to talk to you. And just to be clear, that 6% for a 10-year piece of paper. So obviously, different tenures have different rates. Post the MGP acquisition, we've been highly, highly focused on continuing to delever the balance sheet. We obviously elevated leverage a little bit to bring in that phenomenal portfolio that we added to our company and to transform our company. But as you've seen us do throughout 2022 and into 2023, because it's going to overequitize transactions. And as we sit here today in May 2nd, we have a maturity coming up in roughly 1 year. It's due May 1, 2024. And so we'll continue to use the equity, use our free cash flow to fund transactions and then things that potentially larger transactions look to add those to the balance sheet on a leverage-neutral basis.",
			"<strong>Todd Michael Thomas</strong>",
			"Okay. And then as you look ahead at all of the various investment opportunities and different sort of categories and industries that you're underwriting relative to your cost of capital, do you expect that the spread that you're investing at will improve as you look out at the pipeline over the next few quarters relative to sort of the spread that you've locked in on more recent investments here over the last couple of quarters?",
			"<strong>David Andrew Kieske</strong>",
			"I mean I could start and others chime in. I mean, Todd, each deal is different. And obviously, we have this debate internally a lot. Sure, we'd love to say we can print a 300, 400 basis point spread to our cost of capital. But the intrinsic value of some pieces of real estate that just have -- will trade at lower cap rates and lending opportunities could be at slightly higher yields. And so as we look to balance our -- the overall yield that we generate for -- on our capital over the long term, we want to ensure that we are generating a 100 to 150 basis point spread on a blended basis for -- based on the capital that we deploy on a quarterly and an annual basis. <br/>So while there's the hope that we can deploy capital at higher spreads, sometimes real estate is worth. And to get a deal done, it takes -- it might take a slightly tighter spread to ensure that we can build the partnerships and the relationships and the growth pipeline that we want to deliver over time here.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Barry Jonas from Truist Securities.",
			"<strong>Barry Jonathan Jonas</strong>",
			"When you think about leaning more into new international markets, how do you think about supporting greenfield developments through, say, construction loans versus sale leaseback of existing assets?",
			"<strong>Edward Baltazar Pitoniak</strong>",
			"Yes. Barry, I'll take that at the start and then David can add in. I would say that our confidence around funding development internationally, it needs to be basically in line with the confidence that we need to have to fund development domestically. We've added caveats that if it is international, we need to have even more compensating factors in place to compensate for the risks associated with currency and tax. <br/>But at the end of the day, we're really underwriting the credibility and the credit of the developer/operating partner. So again, whether we're talking about Europe, Japan or other jurisdictions, we won't, by any means, say, (inaudible) I know we won't do it. But the underwriting will have to be even that much more rigorous.<br/>David, I don't know if you want to add to that?",
			"<strong>David Andrew Kieske</strong>",
			"No, I think you hit it perfectly.",
			"<strong>Barry Jonathan Jonas</strong>",
			"That's great. And then just as a follow-up. John, I appreciate the comments on the consumer and your tenants. But MGM did talk last night about seeing maybe more growth at its luxury properties. I'm just curious if you're seeing consistent trends from a coverage perspective across your portfolio? And then maybe to what extent does this or any other dynamic influence your M&amp;A strategy?",
			"<strong>John W. R. Payne</strong>",
			"It's a very good question, Barry. Again, just kind of reiterating what I said about having 11 different tenants, so you get different views. And I think we've tried to build a portfolio where we have the luxury segment and then we have the kind of the middle sector and the properties that cater to them. They all seem to be continuing to perform quite well. Obviously, if a higher-end property, there's a seller who wants to move on that transaction, we're going to be prepared due to David and his team's work to go after that. If there is a regional asset that fits our portfolio where we don't have exposure, we'll be able to go after that as well. <br/>But as it pertains to the operating business, Barry, we continue to ask the questions, where are you seeing weakness and get most of the answers where we're seeing strength. And so it's -- we're going to continue to monitor. And I know we've been talking on this call a lot about nongaming and experiential and [it's helping], Kellan Florio, who joined us as our Chief Investment Officer a year ago are out looking at these different sectors. But it is important to reiterate that we continue to love the casino business. We continue to be amazed each quarter with the results that are delivered by our partners and the -- hopefully, some future partners as well.",
			"<strong>Edward Baltazar Pitoniak</strong>",
			"Barry, I'll just add on to that. Yes, Barry, I was just going to add to that. Clearly, you're seeing across so many consumer sectors the strength of luxury. Based where we are in Midtown Manhattan, our neighborhood effectively feels like it's being taken over by LVMH. And that's simply because there is so much spending happening globally in these luxury categories, and it's one of the reasons our partners like Cabot and Canyon Ranch are doing so well right now being luxury brands within their respective categories of destination golf and wellness.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from James Kammert from Evercore ISI.",
			"<strong>James Kammert</strong>",
			"When you think about looking into these other experiential real estate sectors, is it fair to say that there might be fewer providers of capital in debt equity side such as VICI compared to other mainstream real estate? I'm just curious if that gives you a little bit of an advantage in terms of risk adjustment and how you structure the lease, et cetera, for the benefit of VICI.",
			"<strong>Edward Baltazar Pitoniak</strong>",
			"Yes. Well, first of all, Jim, welcome to Evercore. Good to be talking to you. Yes, I'll turn it over to John in just a moment. But yes, you're absolutely right. What we're really undertaking is to prove out our hypothesis that there's a significant landscape of what we'll call experiential white space across the globe of really dynamic experiential operating businesses that have never been visited by a REIT before and have never considered before a REIT as a source of growth capital. <br/>And with that, I'll turn it over to John because he's having so many of these conversations in which he has told pretty much at the outset, wow, we've never talked to a REIT before. John?",
			"<strong>John W. R. Payne</strong>",
			"Yes. You nailed it, Jim. That's exactly right. In many of these areas, whether it's in health and wellness, youth, collegiate, professional sports, certain forms of family entertainment, we're the first ones that have come to them with a thoughtful approach about how our capital could help them grow in many different ways. And so we literally spend 2, 3, 4 different meetings a day explaining who we are, what we've done, how we can help them. And again, to our opening remarks, it doesn't mean a transaction has to happen at the first meal we have together. It's about building a depth of incredible operators and real estate that over a period of time, we can hopefully transact and build a partnership. <br/>But you've hit on it where there just haven't been a lot of others that have taken on this task because it's not easy work and it takes a lot of time and effort and calls and e-mails and all of that. But we're happy to do it because we see the incredible amount of white space, as Ed noted.",
			"<strong>James Kammert</strong>",
			"Interesting. And where were they getting their capital before? Or do you just think this is as they visit their growth and future plans, they're just thinking more constructively about how they can monetize real estate? I'm just curious how that plays in.",
			"<strong>Edward Baltazar Pitoniak</strong>",
			"Yes. Well, maybe I can offer Canyon Ranch as an example, Jim, whereby when we began talking with John Goff and the Canyon Ranch team back in early 2022, the conversations they principally been having when it came to growth capital or with private equity partners. And what they were concerned about with those private equity partners was, number one, the cost of the capital, given the cost that PE funding partners tend to assign to their own capital; and number two, the investment horizon of perhaps only 5 to 7 years. <br/>And so when Canyon Ranch looked at our offering and looked at our -- both our cost of capital and the fact that we want to be their capital partner forever, it was a pretty compelling alternative to conventional private equity.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Wes Golladay from Baird.",
			"<strong>Wesley Keith Golladay</strong>",
			"I just got a quick question about the VICI Property Fund. Do you expect more of those projects to kick off in a recessionary environment, being that Vegas is so strong? And more in particular, the focus I have on the question would be the Mirage project that was recently approved with the Guitar On The strip?",
			"<strong>Edward Baltazar Pitoniak</strong>",
			"John?",
			"<strong>John W. R. Payne</strong>",
			"Yes. Good to talk to you, Wes. The Mirage project that the Hard Rock team is taking on is spectacular. I think we've seen the footage of it, not only the Guitar Tower, but the refurbishment of the whole properties. And you'd have to talk directly with the Hard Rock team, but I think you hear from them, they're thinking through different ways that they can finance the project with one sits on our land and to our building, and we'd love to be a source of financing for that project longer term as they think through the details of it.<br/>And the fund in general, we've talked to many operators whether throughout our 11 tenants is how we can help them grow with larger projects on our existing assets or how we can help monetize certain assets and help them buy someone else. So we continue to have those conversations as well.",
			"<strong>Wesley Keith Golladay</strong>",
			"Okay. If I could just get a follow-up. I guess the age is going to move a little bit down the street from you land parcel, at least that's what the reports are. Do you have any, I guess, updated plans for potential monetization of land parcel on the strip?",
			"<strong>Edward Baltazar Pitoniak</strong>",
			"John?",
			"<strong>John W. R. Payne</strong>",
			"Well, it's exciting where the (inaudible) are thinking about putting the stadium. I know that 2 exciting -- the most 2 exciting -- the most exciting companies, I guess, when they heard to announce, was MGM and VICI and let it sit right across from many of the resorts that we own and MGM operates. So we'll continue to see how that plays out. But it sure is helping Las Vegas become the sports capital of the world now by adding another team. And Super Bowl's coming next year, F1 is coming later in the year. So we couldn't be more excited. <br/>And you're asking, does it make our land and our resorts more valuable? We think it certainly does and will provide opportunities where the current properties that sit next to the new stadium that's going to be built as well as the undeveloped land that we have throughout the city.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from John DeCree from CBRE.",
			"<strong>John G. DeCree</strong>",
			"Good morning, everyone. Maybe just 1 for me. We've covered quite a bit of ground. David, probably for you. I think I read a footnote in the presentation that the Caesars Forum loan was repaid in May. I was wondering if you could confirm that? And does that impact the put/call that property at all? And then I guess, part 3 is can you let us know how much in commitments that you have unfunded outstanding for various loans?",
			"<strong>David Andrew Kieske</strong>",
			"Yes, John, good to talk to you. Caesars repaid that loan actually yesterday, $400 million principal. It doesn't change the put/call. We actually extended the outside date to 2028 when we could call the Caesars Forum Convention Center. This is all part of Caesars deleveraging. So that continues to make our tenants stronger, and we're happy to get that capital back. And then the total commitments, I don't have that right in front of me, but I'm happy to follow up with you or Gabe, if you have that handy. Otherwise, John, we can follow up with you.",
			"<strong>John W. R. Payne</strong>",
			"Yes, future funding commitments are about $970 million as of March 31.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho.",
			"<strong>Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste</strong>",
			"First one is, I guess I like to know what the current house view on further investing in tribal today is and how you get comfortable if you can't own the land? And perhaps how much more meaningful could you get involved there?",
			"<strong>Edward Baltazar Pitoniak</strong>",
			"John?",
			"<strong>John W. R. Payne</strong>",
			"Yes, I'll take that question. It's important to understand that today, our relationships with the 3 tribal nations are on commercial gaming properties, whether that's in Cincinnati, in Tunica and in Southern Indiana. I think your question is around, is there ultimately going to be an opportunity with these partners or with another partner on their tribal land for us to make investments? And it's something we've talked to partners about before, and it potentially could be. But at this time, we've not made any of those investments.<br/>We really have enjoyed and will continue to build our relationships with tribal nations because they're amazing casino operators, and they're looking to deploy the capital that they've earned in their tribal nation casinos on to commercial gaming, and we're here to help them think through that if they're interested.",
			"<strong>Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste</strong>",
			"That's helpful. And yes, I should have made that distinction there. And 1 more. You read that MGM recently was approved to build Japan's first casino in Osaka. I guess, given the relationship there, what's the likelihood of your interest in getting involved? And what sort of risk premium perhaps would you require?",
			"<strong>Edward Baltazar Pitoniak</strong>",
			"Yes. We'll handle the -- it is a very big project. There's a lot of parties involved. They are obviously financing this in a credit market. Japan is quite low cost. MGM knows we're always here to help them. If we can be of help, we will be. But I'd say we're a long way off at this point from knowing if we can help them. And if so, how we would help them.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley.",
			"<strong>Ronald Kamdem</strong>",
			"Two quick ones. Just 1 on the guidance. Can you just remind us what's the organic growth implied to get to that FFO growth number? And then on the balance sheet, I see the 5.9x debt to EBITDA. Where is that going to trend to by the end of the year or assuming no more deals?",
			"<strong>David Andrew Kieske</strong>",
			"Hey, Ron. It's Dave -- Ron, it's David. Good to talk to you. In terms of guidance, we just have our base escalation. So 2% for Caesars, 1.5% for some of the other tenants. We do not make any assumptions around CPI bumps or other potential economic changes if that's what you're asking. And then in terms of the balance sheet, we're actually 5.7x today since the cash that came in from Caesars yesterday. So we're 5.9x at quarter end, that was just due to a little bit of a lower cash balance at quarter end. And then that's trending to kind of about 5.6x, 5.5x by year-end based on where we see the business is trending.",
			"<strong>Ronald Kamdem</strong>",
			"Great. And then just the last one, just a lot more questions on theme parks and as I sort of talked about being open to all experiential. Is there a way to sort of dig in deeper and just sort of highlight what is attractive, what is not attractive, what markets, geographies, deal structure, anything would be helpful.",
			"<strong>Edward Baltazar Pitoniak</strong>",
			"Yes. So I think when it comes to theme parks generically, Ron, what's appealing about them is what's, frankly, appealing about our large Las Vegas assets and frankly, a lot of our large regional assets as well, which is their big complex physical plants with big complex P&amp;Ls that have high economic productivity in relation with the capital value of the asset. And we believe that theme parks tick the 4 boxes that we look at in any investment category we're looking at, which is lower than average cyclicality for consumer discretionary at large. Theme parks are very often an affordable luxury in times of recession. Not unlike ski resorts, which I used to work in. <br/>There is generally an absence of secular threat since people are not generally building rollercoasters in their backyards or having Amazon deliver to them. There's a healthy supply-demand balance because people are generally not building the theme park. And then finally, number four, they've obviously proven their durability over, frankly, more than a century, going back to the big exhibitions and fairs of the late 1800. <br/>So a lot to recommend the category. John and Kellen and the team continue to work on getting to know the players, their needs, their capital needs and opportunities. And we'll hopefully someday be able to invest in that category.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our final question comes from Chris Darling from Green Street.",
			"<strong>Chris Darling</strong>",
			"I recognize that VICI is focused really on growing accretively. But I'd like to better understand how you evaluate the long-term profile of some of your existing assets. So can you talk a little bit about how you think about that aspect? And then when you look across your regional gaming portfolio, are there any markets or assets that maybe you're less comfortable owning for the long term?",
			"<strong>Edward Baltazar Pitoniak</strong>",
			"Yes, Chris. So I'll have John answer the back half of that question because we have, since our beginning -- even though our beginning is only 5.5 years ago, we have actually engaged in portfolio optimization in terms of disposals. But it's a really good question to ask because we've contended for a while now that we are the first REIT to bring the net lease structure to what is genuinely Class A real estate in terms of scale, quality of fit and efficient -- fit and finish and economic magnitude and durability. <br/>And so you look at, for instance, our first marquee asset, Caesar Palace Las Vegas, just over 60 years old. And as John will tell you in a moment, it had its best year ever last year. We've got weighted average lease term of around 40 years. And when we look at our Las Vegas assets, when we look at great regional assets like the #1 regional asset in America, MGM National Harbor, we have very high confidence that these assets will be economically productive and grow in value, in part because of our same-store NOI growth, which Green Street has written about better than anybody.<br/>These assets will continue to appreciate and value for decades to come. But John, do you want to talk about the approach we take at making sure neither we nor our tenants are in assets we don't want to be in anymore?",
			"<strong>John W. R. Payne</strong>",
			"Yes, Chris, it's a very good question. And as Ed touched on, we constantly talk to our tenants, our operating partners about optimizing their portfolio. And as Ed alluded to, we -- since we started VICI 5 years ago, we've had a tenant come to us, (inaudible) in Louisiana that said, \"Look, this doesn't fit our portfolio. You own it.\" And we've worked together to sell the asset. There's been other situations where the tenant want it out, but we wanted to keep the real estate and buildings, and we've transferred and found another high-quality tenant. So we'll continue to do that throughout our lives running this business. And if there's a tenant that doesn't want to be in the business, we should work with them either say, \"Hey, let's sell this over a holdco or let's just find another tenant that wants to run the business.\" <br/>The other thing we do is continuing to look in markets to diversify our portfolio. With cities, what states are we not currently in, in gaming as an example, where we'd love to own real estate and there's many markets throughout the United States we are not in. We have 50 properties today, but there is a lot of opportunity in markets we're not in. And then there's other markets where, boy, it would be nice to have another asset, and we continue to do that. <br/>So very good question. It's something that's top of mind that we have with our tenants, and we'll continue to optimize our portfolio over the coming years.",
			"<strong>Chris Darling</strong>",
			"Got it. That's very helpful. And maybe a second question for me. Just curious if you've had any recent conversations with Caesars regarding the ground-up development, I believe, in Danville, Virginia, just given that, that project, I think, has broken ground now.",
			"<strong>Edward Baltazar Pitoniak</strong>",
			"John?",
			"<strong>John W. R. Payne</strong>",
			"Yes, they just got -- yes, they just got approval. They'll be opening a temporary facility at that asset run by Caesars. It's also in a partnership with our other partners, The Eastern Band of Cherokee, they're partners there as well. And so we do have conversations with Caesars about a variety of things. Could that ultimately -- would that ultimately be an asset we would be interested over time if the ownership wanted to monetize the real estate in the buildings? Yes, we would be very interested in that. And so we first look and get it up and running, get it stabilized, be incredibly successful. And there's a time that, that conversation, we looked at.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"This concludes our Q&amp;A. I'll now hand back to Ed Pitoniak, CEO, for any final remarks.",
			"<strong>Edward Baltazar Pitoniak</strong>",
			"Yes. Well, thanks for your time today, everybody. I'll go back to what I stressed on our last earnings call back at the end of February, and that is when you take the midpoint of our guidance for AFFO growth for 2023, which is 10%, combine that with our dividend yield, which is currently around 4.5, a little higher than that, you get 14.5 points of potential total return. <br/>And I would just compare that again to what you're seeing in REITs generally and even more generally, the S&amp;P 500, which is certainly not shaping up to be a year combining 10% earnings growth and 4.5% dividend yield. <br/>So with that, we'll thank you for your time today and look forward to seeing you again in late July. Bye for now.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",

			"Simon Property (SPG) came out with quarterly funds from operations (FFO) of $2.74 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.80 per share. This compares to FFO of $2.78 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.",
			"This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of -2.14%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this shopping mall real estate investment trust would post FFO of $3.14 per share when it actually produced FFO of $3.15, delivering a surprise of 0.32%.",
			"Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates three times.",
			"Simon Property , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry, posted revenues of $1.35 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.08%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.3 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.",
			"The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.",
			"Simon Property shares have lost about 3.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 8.6%.",
			"<b>What's Next for Simon Property?</b>",
			"While Simon Property has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?",
			"There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.",
			"Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.",
			"Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Simon Property: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.",
			"It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $2.96 on $1.35 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $12.04 on $5.49 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.",
			"Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, REIT and Equity Trust - Retail is currently in the top 36% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.",

			"This real estate investment trust that owns and manages shopping centers is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.29 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.6%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.",

In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"anticipates,\" or \"intends,\" or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy. We may also make additional forward-looking statements from time to time. All such subsequent forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, by us or on our behalf, are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in or contemplated by this release.

All forward-looking statements apply only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise forward-looking statements which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.",
			"<b><u>Definition of FFO:</u></b>",
			"FFO provides relevant and meaningful information about the Company's operating performance that is necessary, along with net income and cash flows, for an understanding of the Company's operating results. The Company believes FFO is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net income. Net income assumes that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. The values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and the Company believes FFO more accurately reflects the value of the Company's real estate assets. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. (\"NAREIT\") as net income computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), excluding gains or losses on sales of operating stores and impairment write downs of depreciable real estate assets, plus depreciation and amortization related to real estate and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. The Company believes that to further understand the Company's performance, FFO should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements. FFO should not be considered a replacement of net income computed in accordance with GAAP.",
			"For informational purposes, the Company also presents Core FFO.  Core FFO excludes revenues and expenses not core to our operations and non-cash interest.  Although the Company's calculation of Core FFO differs from NAREIT's definition of FFO and may not be comparable to that of other REITs and real estate companies, the Company believes it provides a meaningful supplemental measure of operating performance. The Company believes that by excluding revenues and expenses not core to our operations and non-cash interest charges, stockholders and potential investors are presented with an indicator of our operating performance that more closely achieves the objectives of the real estate industry in presenting FFO. Core FFO by the Company should not be considered a replacement of the NAREIT definition of FFO. The computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company's performance, as an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an indicator of the Company's ability to make cash distributions.",
			"<b><u>Definition of Same-Store:</u></b>",
			"The Company's same-store pool for the periods presented consists of 914 stores that are wholly-owned and operated and that were stabilized by the first day of the earliest calendar year presented.  The Company considers a store to be stabilized once it has been open for three years or has sustained average square foot occupancy of 80.0% or more for one calendar year. The Company believes that by providing same-store results from a stabilized pool of stores, with accompanying operating metrics including, but not limited to occupancy, rental revenue (growth), operating expenses (growth), net operating income (growth), etc., stockholders and potential investors are able to evaluate operating performance without the effects of non-stabilized occupancy levels, rent levels, expense levels, acquisitions or completed developments.  Same-store results should not be used as a basis for future same-store performance or for the performance of the Company's stores as a whole.",

(NYSE: WELL</b>) today announced results for the quarter ended <span class=\"xn-chron\">March 31, 2023</span>.",
			"<b><u>Recent Highlights</u></b>",
			"<b><u>Capital Activity and Liquidity</u></b> During the quarter, net debt to consolidated enterprise value improved to 28.2% at <span class=\"xn-chron\">March 31, 2023</span> from 29.5% at <span class=\"xn-chron\">December 31, 2022</span>. Through <span class=\"xn-chron\">May 1, 2023</span>, we sourced over <span class=\"xn-money\">$1.0 billion</span> of attractively priced capital, including debt, equity, and proceeds from dispositions and loan payoffs, to fund accretive capital deployment opportunities and to further strengthen our already robust liquidity position. In <span class=\"xn-chron\">March 2023</span>, we entered into a one-year interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of <span class=\"xn-money\">$350 million</span>. The interest rate swap fixes the underlying one month term SOFR variable interest rate for a fixed rate of 4.385% on our <span class=\"xn-money\">$1.0 billion USD</span> unsecured term loan maturing <span class=\"xn-chron\">July 19, 2026</span>.",
			"<b><u>Notable Investment Activity Completed During the Quarter</u></b>",
			"In the first quarter, we completed <span class=\"xn-money\">$785 million</span> of pro rata gross investments, including <span class=\"xn-money\">$529 million</span> in acquisitions and loan funding and <span class=\"xn-money\">$257 million</span> in development funding. We opened four development projects for an aggregate pro rata investment amount of <span class=\"xn-money\">$57 million</span>. Additionally, during the quarter we completed pro rata property dispositions and loan payoffs of <span class=\"xn-money\">$92 million</span>.",
			"<u>Outpatient Medical Acquisitions</u> During the quarter, we acquired 29 medical office buildings totaling 1.3 million rentable square feet across multiple transactions for <span class=\"xn-money\">$348 million</span>, representing an initial yield of 6.9%. These acquisitions include the <span class=\"xn-money\">$78 million</span> purchase of a 174,000 square foot medical office building strategically located in <span class=\"xn-location\">Washington D.C.</span>, along K Street's prime medical office corridor, with 82% current occupancy and an initial yield of 6.6%.",
			"<u>U.K. Seniors Housing Acquisition</u> During the quarter, we acquired a portfolio of care homes located in <span class=\"xn-location\">Northern Ireland</span> for <span class=\"xn-money\">$75 million</span>. The communities will be operated by Healthcare Ireland under a new triple-net master lease.",
			"<u>Integra Healthcare Properties Transition</u> As part of the previously announced transition and sale of 147 skilled nursing facilities operated by ProMedica to Integra Healthcare Properties, in <span class=\"xn-chron\">January 2023</span> we sold to Integra a 15% interest in 31 skilled nursing assets for approximately <span class=\"xn-money\">$74 million</span>. The transaction represents the second tranche in the formation of an 85/15 joint venture between Welltower and Integra, with the remaining tranches expected to close later in the year.",
			"<u>Other Transactions</u> Additionally during the first quarter, we acquired two seniors housing communities for <span class=\"xn-money\">$20 million</span>. We also received <span class=\"xn-money\">$13 million</span> in aggregate proceeds from loan payoffs and the disposition of two seniors housing properties.",
			"<b><u>Notable Investment Activity Subsequent to Quarter End</u></b>",
			"<u>Genesis HealthCare</u> As disclosed on <span class=\"xn-chron\">March 2, 2021</span> as part of the substantial exit of the Genesis HealthCare operating relationship, we leased a portfolio of seven facilities which were subleased to Genesis HealthCare and subject to a purchase option held by us. As part of the <span class=\"xn-chron\">March 2021</span> transaction, we entered into a forward sale agreement for the seven properties valued at approximately <span class=\"xn-money\">$182 million</span> which was expected to close when our purchase option became exercisable. In the second quarter of 2021, we transitioned the sublease from Genesis HealthCare to Complete Care Management. On <span class=\"xn-chron\">May 1, 2023</span>, we closed on the purchase option and simultaneously effectuated the forward sale agreement to sell the properties to a tri-party joint venture with Aurora Health Network, Peace Capital (an affiliate of Complete Care Management) and us. The transactions resulted in net cash proceeds of approximately <span class=\"xn-money\">$104 million</span> after our retained interest in the properties.",
			"<b><u>D</u></b><b><u>ividend</u></b> On May 2, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the quarter ended <span class=\"xn-chron\">March 31, 2023</span> of <span class=\"xn-money\">$0.61</span> per share. This dividend, which will be paid on <span class=\"xn-chron\">May 23, 2023</span> to stockholders of record as of <span class=\"xn-chron\">May 16, 2023</span>, will be our 208th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends remains subject to review and approval by the Board of Directors.",
			"<b><u>Outlook for 2023</u></b> Net income attributable to common stockholders guidance has been revised to a range of <span class=\"xn-money\">$0.57</span> to <span class=\"xn-money\">$0.72</span> per diluted share from the previous range of <span class=\"xn-money\">$0.57</span> to <span class=\"xn-money\">$0.75</span> per diluted share, primarily due to change in projected net gains/losses/impairments and depreciation and amortization. We increased the midpoint of the guidance range of full year normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders to a range of <span class=\"xn-money\">$3.39</span> to <span class=\"xn-money\">$3.54</span> per diluted share from the previous range of <span class=\"xn-money\">$3.35</span> to <span class=\"xn-money\">$3.53</span> per diluted share. In preparing our guidance, we have updated or confirmed the following assumptions:",
			"Our guidance does not include any additional investments, dispositions or capital transactions beyond those we have announced, nor any other expenses, impairments, unanticipated additions to the loan loss reserve or other additional normalizing items. Please see the Supplemental Reporting Measures section for further discussion and our definition of normalized FFO and SSNOI and Exhibit 3 for a reconciliation of the outlook for net income available to common stockholders to normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders. We will provide additional detail regarding our 2023 outlook and assumptions on the first quarter 2023 conference call.",
			"<b><u>Conference Call Information</u></b> We have scheduled a conference call on Wednesday, May 3, 2023 at <span class=\"xn-chron\">9:00 a.m. Eastern Time</span> to discuss our first quarter 2023 results, industry trends and portfolio performance. Telephone access will be available by dialing (888) 340-5024 or (646) 960-0135 (international). For those unable to listen to the call live, a taped rebroadcast will be available beginning two hours after completion of the call through <span class=\"xn-chron\">May 10, 2023</span>. To access the rebroadcast, dial (800) 770-2030 or (647) 362-9199 (international). The conference ID number is 8230248. To participate in the webcast, log on to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:www.welltower.com;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"http://www.welltower.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">www.welltower.com</a> 15 minutes before the call to download the necessary software. Replays will be available for 90 days.",
			"<b><u>Supplemental Reporting Measures</u></b> We believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders (\"NICS\"), as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\"), are the most appropriate earnings measurements. However, we consider funds from operations (\"FFO\"), normalized FFO, net operating income (\"NOI\"), same store NOI (\"SSNOI\"), revenue per occupied room (\"RevPOR\"), same store RevPOR (\"SS RevPOR\"), expense per occupied room (\"ExpPOR\") and same store ExpPOR (\"SS ExpPOR\") to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. These supplemental measures are disclosed on our pro rata ownership basis. Pro rata amounts are derived by reducing consolidated amounts for minority partners' noncontrolling ownership interests and adding our minority ownership share of unconsolidated amounts. We do not control unconsolidated investments. While we consider pro rata disclosures useful, they may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our joint venture arrangements and should be used with caution.",
			"Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\") created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO attributable to common stockholders, as defined by NAREIT, means net income attributable to common stockholders, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and impairments of depreciable assets, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests. Normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders represents FFO attributable to common stockholders adjusted for certain items detailed in Exhibit 2. We believe that normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance because investors and equity analysts may use this measure to compare the operating performance of Welltower between periods or as compared to other REITs or other companies on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated and/or incalculable items.",
			"We define NOI as total revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property operating expenses. Property operating expenses represent costs associated with managing, maintaining and servicing tenants for our properties. These expenses include, but are not limited to, property-related payroll and benefits, property management fees paid to operators, marketing, housekeeping, food service, maintenance, utilities, property taxes and insurance. General and administrative expenses represent general overhead costs that are unrelated to property operations and unallocable to the properties, or transaction costs. These expenses include, but are not limited to, payroll and benefits related to corporate employees, professional services, office expenses and depreciation of corporate fixed assets. SSNOI is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio. As used herein, same store is generally defined as those revenue-generating properties in the portfolio for the relevant year-over-year reporting periods. Acquisitions and development conversions are included in the same store amounts five full quarters after acquisition or being placed into service. Land parcels, loans and sub-leases, as well as any properties sold or classified as held for sale during the period, are excluded from the same store amounts. Redeveloped properties (including major refurbishments of a Seniors Housing Operating property where 20% or more of units are simultaneously taken out of commission for 30 days or more or Outpatient Medical properties undergoing a change in intended use) are excluded from the same store amounts until five full quarters post completion of the redevelopment. Properties undergoing operator transitions and/or segment transitions are also excluded from the same store amounts until five full quarters post completion of the operator transition or segment transition. In addition, properties significantly impacted by force majeure, acts of God or other extraordinary adverse events are excluded from same store amounts until five full quarters after the properties are placed back into service. SSNOI excludes non-cash NOI and includes adjustments to present consistent property ownership percentages and to translate Canadian properties and UK properties using a consistent exchange rate. Normalizers include adjustments that in management's opinion are appropriate in considering SSNOI, a supplemental, non-GAAP performance measure. None of these adjustments, which may increase or decrease SSNOI, are reflected in our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Significant normalizers (defined as any that individually exceed 0.50% of SSNOI growth per property type) are separately disclosed and explained. We believe NOI and SSNOI provide investors relevant and useful information because they measure the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI and SSNOI to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties. No reconciliation of the forecasted range for SSNOI on a combined basis or by property type is included in this release because we are unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the comparable GAAP financial measure without unreasonable efforts, and we believe such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision that could be confusing or misleading to investors.",
			"RevPOR represents the average revenues generated per occupied room per month and ExpPOR represents the average expenses per occupied room per month at our Seniors Housing Operating properties. These metrics are calculated as our pro rata version of total resident fees and services revenues or property operating expenses from the income statement, divided by average monthly occupied room days. SS RevPOR and SS ExpPOR are used to evaluate the RevPOR and ExpPOR performance of our properties under a consistent population, which eliminates changes in the composition of our portfolio. They are based on the same pool of properties used for SSNOI and includes any revenue or expense normalizations used for SSNOI. We use RevPOR, ExpPOR, SS RevPOR and SS ExpPOR to evaluate the revenue-generating capacity and profit potential of our Seniors Housing Operating portfolio independent of fluctuating occupancy rates. They are also used in comparison against industry and competitor statistics, if known, to evaluate the quality of our Seniors Housing Operating portfolio.",
			"We measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios. The leverage ratios which include net debt to consolidated enterprise value, indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to long-term debt, net of cash and restricted cash. We expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile. Net debt is defined as total long-term debt, excluding operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. Consolidated enterprise value represents the sum of net debt, the fair market value of our common stock and noncontrolling interests.",
			"Our supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and ratings agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. Our management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results and in making operating decisions. Additionally, they are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. The supplemental reporting measures do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, the supplemental reporting measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies. Please see the exhibits for reconciliations of supplemental reporting measures and the supplemental information package for the quarter ended <span class=\"xn-chron\">March 31, 2023</span>, which is available on Welltower's website (<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:www.welltower.com;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"http://www.welltower.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">www.welltower.com</a>), for information and reconciliations of additional supplemental reporting measures.",

			"Good evening, and thank you for joining us for SBA's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.

			"<strong>Brendan Thomas Cavanagh</strong>",
			"Thank you, Mark. Good evening. <br/>We started the year with a solid first quarter. Our results were slightly ahead of our expectations and allowed us to increase our full year 2023 outlook for most metrics. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the first quarter were $617.3 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $610.4 million. <br/>Foreign exchange rates represented a benefit of approximately $600,000 when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter and a headwind of $2.5 million when compared to the first quarter of 2022. <br/>Same tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the first quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4.7% net over the first quarter of 2022 including the impact of 4.2% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth was 8.9%. <br/>Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the first quarter of last year was 8.5% on a gross basis and 5.1% on a net basis, including 3.4% of term. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings, representing new revenue placed under contract during the first quarter, remained steady and it was similar to the fourth quarter. <br/>We again saw balanced contributions from each of our largest customers. During the first quarter, amendment activity represented 51% of our domestic bookings and new leases represented 49%. The big 4 carriers of AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented approximately 95% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue signed up during the quarter. <br/>Domestically, churn was in line with our prior quarter projections, and our full year churn expectations remain the same as we provided last quarter, including $25 million to $30 million of Sprint merger-related churn. <br/>Internationally, on a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 2.5% net, including 7.8% of churn or 10.3% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was good again with similar results to our solid fourth quarter. Inflation-based escalators also continued to make healthy contributions to our organic growth, although these inflationary rates have begun to decline from their 2022 highs. <br/>In Brazil, our largest international market, we had another good quarter, although the impact of the previously discussed TIM agreement weighed on our first quarter same-tower organic growth. This growth rate in Brazil was 4.7% on a constant currency basis, including the impact of 5.9% of churn. <br/>International churn remains elevated, but in line with expectations and our previously provided outlook. Excluding Oi consolidation-related churn, we believe 2023 will be the high-water mark for international churn. <br/>As a reminder, our 2023 outlook does not include any churn assumptions related to the Oi consolidation other than associated with the TIM agreement. But if during the year, we were to enter into any further agreements with other carriers related to the Oi consolidation that have an impact on the current year, we would adjust our outlook accordingly at that time. <br/>During the first quarter, 78% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil with Brazil representing 15.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 12.4% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses. <br/>Tower cash flow for the first quarter was $491 million. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong as well with a first quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 84.3% and an international tower cash flow margin of 69.9% or 91.8% excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses. <br/>Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $459.3 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 68.7% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 74%. Approximately 97% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the first quarter. <br/>During the first quarter, our Services business had another strong quarter with $58.2 million in revenue and $14.1 million of segment operating profit. Our carrier customers remained busy deploying new 5G-related equipment during the quarter, and our services backlogs also remained healthy at quarter end. <br/>Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO in the first quarter was $341.7 million. AFFO per share was $3.13, an increase of 5.7% over the first quarter of 2022. AFFO growth was hindered by increased interest rates, which are anticipated to impact growth rates throughout the year. <br/>During the first quarter, we continued to invest in our portfolio, acquiring 14 communication sites for total cash consideration of $8.6 million. During the quarter, we also built 52 new sites. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 56 sites, all in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $63.7 million. <br/>We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the year. <br/>In addition to new towers, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites. During the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $11.6 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. <br/>At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 70% of our towers, and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years. <br/>With that, I'll now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our balance sheet.",
			"<strong>Mark DeRussy</strong>",
			"Thanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $12.9 billion of total debt and $12.7 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.9x, below the low end of our target range. <br/>Our first quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense remains at a strong 4.7x. <br/>During and subsequent to quarter end, we borrowed and repaid certain amounts under our revolving credit facility. And as of today, we have a $595 million outstanding balance under our $1.5 billion revolver. <br/>The current weighted average interest rate of our total outstanding debt is 3.1%, with a weighted average maturity of approximately 3.8 years. The current rate on our outstanding revolver balance is 6.5%. The interest rate on 93% of our current outstanding debt is fixed. <br/>During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock, and we currently have $505 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company's shares outstanding at March 31, 2023, were 108.3 million. <br/>In addition, during the quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $93.9 million or $0.85 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $0.85 per share, payable on June 21, 2023, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 26, 2023. <br/>This dividend represents an increase of approximately 20% over the dividend paid in the year ago period and only represents 27% of our projected full year AFFO. <br/>With that, I will now turn the call over to Jeff.",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"Thanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone. <br/>The first quarter represented a very good start to 2023. Our team continued to execute at a very high level, and we produced solid year-over-year growth in each of our key metrics. Each of our largest U.S. customers remain busy, and they contributed relatively equally to our organic leasing activity during the quarter. <br/>The focus of their activity was a balanced mix of adding equipment to sites in support of 5G through the deployment of new spectrum bands and infill and coverage expansion through brand-new co-locations. <br/>While we believe domestic activity in 2023 will fall below the peak levels of activity in 2022, we expect our carrier customers to stay relatively busy with additional network deployment over the next several years for a number of reasons. Some of AT&amp;T's and Verizon C-band licenses will not be cleared until later this year; the C-band and 3.45 gigahertz licenses won by T-Mobile have been delayed due to the lapse of the FCC spectrum authority; dual-band radios that our customers are planning to use in their deployment supporting 3.45 gigahertz and C-band frequencies have just been approved by the FCC; and dual-band radio supporting C-band and CBRS are still pending approval; and DISH will be moving forward with additional co-locations to meet their 2025 coverage requirements. We believe all of these developments will drive multiyear continued development activity. <br/>Also encouraging about the prospects for future network development activity is the letter sent last week from CTIA to the White House, imploring the President to free up 1,500 megahertz of additional mid-band spectrum currently held by the Department of Defense and other governmental agencies. <br/>The request is for the spectrum to be made available on a full power license basis, which obviously would have positive implications for additional macro site activity. The request from CTIA demonstrates the industry believes that more network resources will be necessary to handle increasing demand for volume, quality and new applications and to stay competitive with the rest of the world. <br/>Just as the last 20 years has demonstrated the need for continuous network investment, we believe the future will be the same. We believe this will provide a continued positive environment for SBA. <br/>Internationally, we also had a solid quarter with continued steady organic leasing activity. During the first quarter, 42% of new international business signed up in the quarter came from amendments to existing leases, and 58% came through new leases with particularly strong contributions from Tanzania and South Africa. <br/>Brazil also had a strong quarter, ahead of our internal expectations with contributions from each of the big 3 carriers in that market as well as good-sized contributions from CPI-based escalators. <br/>The integration of the GTS assets has gone very smoothly, and these assets are performing well thus far. And we have seen a stabilization in the currency exchange rate that has contributed to our increased full year outlook. <br/>We remain excited about our opportunities in Brazil over the coming years as we build on our strong customer relationships and expect meaningful 5G-related investments and continued expansion of wireless services throughout the country. <br/>Moving on now to our balance sheet. We remain in a very strong position. As we have stated before, we continue to be a preferred issuer in the debt markets we currently participate in with extremely good access to capital. <br/>With respect to the current interest rate environment, fortunately, we do not have any debt maturities until October 2024. Thus, we do not need to issue incremental debt today unless we see a compelling use of capital that we expect to be additive to long-term shareholder value. <br/>We finished the quarter with 93% of our debt fixed and thus, we are only modestly exposed to significant interest rate fluctuations. <br/>Our exposure to floating rate debt is also expected to decline further as we anticipate further paying down our outstanding revolver balance throughout the year, absent other more compelling capital allocation. <br/>While our first choice for capital allocation continues to be portfolio growth, today, the market is pretty slow globally and lacking attractive opportunities. That, of course, can change quickly, and we will be ready when it does. <br/>We ended the quarter with a net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 6.9x, below our target range and giving us flexibility if we see value-enhancing investment opportunities. <br/>As a result of our strong financial position and our optimism about our future, today, we announced our second quarter dividend consistent with our first quarter dividend, which represents a nearly 20% year-over-year increase. <br/>This dividend represents only approximately 27% of our projected AFO in our 2023 outlook, leaving us substantial capital for additional investment in portfolio growth, stock repurchases and revolver payments. Our financial condition remains very strong. <br/>Last quarter, I mentioned the fourth quarter ratings upgrade we received from Standard &amp; Poor's to just below investment grade. Since our last earnings release, we received another ratings increase this time from Moody's. These upgrades are indicative of the comfort the rating agencies have in the strength and stability of our underlying business. <br/>The future of our business remains bright. Our customers continue to have significant network needs, and we are committed to supporting them and efficiently and effectively meeting those needs. I want to thank our customers and I want to thank our team members for the significant effort put in by all to the contribution to our shared success. We look forward to sharing with you our progress as we move throughout the balance of 2023. <br/>And with that, Eric, we are now ready for questions.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) And first, we will hear from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson.",
			"<strong>Nicholas Ralph Del Deo</strong>",
			"It looks like you did about $20 million or $21 million in leasing in the first quarter, your guidance implies maybe $51 million or so for the rest of the year. Should we think of the deceleration from here being fairly linear? Or is it going to have a bit of a different shape to it?",
			"<strong>Brendan Thomas Cavanagh</strong>",
			"That should be fairly linear, Nick. The $21 million that you mentioned is about right for the first quarter, and I would expect it to be kind of a gradual step down throughout the year.",
			"<strong>Nicholas Ralph Del Deo</strong>",
			"Okay. Okay. Good. And then with respect to new builds overseas, it looks like the pace stepped down quite a bit versus what you were doing in 2022. So I'm just wondering if that's kind of normal noise or if there's something more substantive that we should be cognizant of.",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"Yes. I think it's just a little bit of a slow getting out of the gate for the year. I don't think it's any more than that, and we're not making any material adjustments to what we think we're going to do this year.",
			"<strong>Nicholas Ralph Del Deo</strong>",
			"Okay. Which countries are you most focused on from a new build perspective?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"Really attracts our largest markets. So I would say outside the U.S., it would be Brazil, South Africa, Tanzania. But we're -- we will build towers, I believe, in every country in which we're currently operating for this year.",
			"<strong>Brendan Thomas Cavanagh</strong>",
			"One thing, Nick, is that in Brazil, a little bit of that slowdown is with the merger that took place among the carriers, there's some focus on that. So that's put a little bit of a slowdown on the newbuilds temporarily, but we would expect over time, that will obviously come back and pick up.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And next, we'll hear from Jonathan Atkin with RBC.",
			"<strong>Jonathan Atkin</strong>",
			"So given the comment that you made, Jeff, about -- I think it was Jeff, you made a comment about lack of -- relative lack of compelling portfolio growth opportunities, wondered why stock buybacks didn't kind of rank higher on the pecking order in terms of capital allocation. <br/>And then secondly, as you think about U.S. leasing specifically, just wondering if you can maybe give us some of the puts and takes around any carriers that you might see even ramping on your portfolio, the activity level and then those that might be kind of tapering and what kind of rate of change you would expect.",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"Yes. In terms of the stock repurchases, Jon, they are definitely high on our priority list as we've demonstrated over the years, and they will continue to be. We just feel like at this moment in time that we need to let the Fed do their thing and get to the point where we see that interest rates have stopped going up because the rate that they're increasing has a direct impact on the cost of our revolving credit facility. <br/>So we think during this particular period of time and given the rate that we're paying on the revolver that, that is absolutely the best use of our temporary capital allocations. But rest assured, we will be buying material amounts of stock back over the coming years. <br/>In terms of the rate of changes of the carriers. And we don't want to get into too much detail about who's exactly doing what, and I think it's been fairly well broadcast that who was spending the most money last year and who was the most active. T-Mobile and DISH really were the 2 big ones last year for the industry. Verizon and AT&amp;T were busy. <br/>And that really hasn't changed a whole lot this year other than the aggregate amounts when you add it all up what we expect for this year in terms of the volume of activity is going to be a little bit off from last year.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And next, we'll hear from Walter Piecyk with LightShed.",
			"<strong>Walter Paul Piecyk</strong>",
			"I guess a follow-up, and sorry for not knowing this, but what is the size of that loan, meaning that when -- how much more do you need to pay down. Obviously, given the rate environment understood, why you would allocate...",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"The revolver is $595 million, Walt. And absent some other use of capital allocation, that will be paid off by the end of this year.",
			"<strong>Walter Paul Piecyk</strong>",
			"Got it. So I mean who know -- the rates have been so volatile, obviously. But there's -- can we assume there's just no reason to keep any of it, meaning that like we should just assume 0 share repurchase until that's done. And then when it's done, you kind of unleash on the share repurchase? Or is there other elements in your cap structure that I'm not remembering that would impact the timing of when the share repurchase would kick back in?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"I think your intuition is directionally correct. I mean, right now, we're using dollars to pay back 6.5% debt. When that's paid down, we won't be earning 6.5% on our cash. So we'll be looking for other uses.",
			"<strong>Walter Paul Piecyk</strong>",
			"Yes. And then similar, I guess, question on the dividend, not that I'm ever complaining about steady dividend growth because obviously that helps to broaden the investor base. But I guess I have to ask the question, like why increase the dividend to that amount, if at all, if it makes more sense to maybe get rid of that element of your debt?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"We're very confident that the debt, unless we spend additional money on something that will be obviously better, will be gone this year. So we didn't want to get off of a long-term dividend trend that we're trying to establish here just for the sake of less than a year.",
			"<strong>Walter Paul Piecyk</strong>",
			"Understood. And just one last question. I think the cable companies have been -- this is my opinion. I don't -- I'm not stating this as a fact, but maybe have been delayed in building infrastructure maybe because of some vendor issues associated with some of the spectrum that they have. <br/>And I'm just curious -- and it seems like that may be coming -- or that might be loosening up going forward. I'm just curious if you can kind of characterize any relationships with -- however you want to describe them. Basically, I'm asking about the cable companies, in terms of as their subscribers and usage ramp, do you see an appetite for starting to add more assets on your towers?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"Yes. I think they will, for sure, but they rely very heavily on outsourcing to Verizon's network, at least Charter and Comcast. So with that in mind it's kind of their built-in default system, what they have to do around their other spectrum that they can develop is more limited. We are getting some business from them, but of course, it pales in comparison to the 4 traditional wireless service providers.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And next, we'll hear from David Barden with Bank of America.",
			"<strong>David William Barden</strong>",
			"I guess 2 questions, if I could. I guess maybe, Brendan, this is for you. The -- we're all kind of looking at DISH exposure. And we're -- based on your commentary and others, it feels like we're going to get to the mid-June build-out requirements. Not clear how much beyond that we're going to go at DISH. So I guess 2 questions would be, number one, if we take the 15,000 cell sites that they said that they were going to need to build this first stage of getting their licenses all locked down, and we multiply that by your percentage of domestic towers, and we assume that you've gotten roughly that percentage, it would seem like that would be roughly a $40 million or so number. Is your kind of run rate annualized exposure to DISH, if you could kind of validate that or tell me where I'm wrong, that would be helpful. <br/>And then second, with respect to kind of the second half of the year, given kind of where DISH's finances stand, what have you assumed in the guidance exit rate heading into 2024?",
			"<strong>Brendan Thomas Cavanagh</strong>",
			"Yes, David, first on your estimate of approximately how much they represent on a run rate, that's in the right ballpark today. We still continue to have activity though with them. They are still signing up new business, not at the same pace they were a year ago. And so we'll exit the year at something obviously greater than that would be our expectation given the fact that we're constantly signing up new business. <br/>And then really, it's a question of as they turn their sights towards their 2025 obligations, how much more will be required? And we are pretty confident based on our conversations with them that there will be a good bit more required. So we'll have to see. <br/>But I think for the balance of this year, a lot of it is focused on deployment of a lot of what they've already signed up, and we'll see how much more it varies as they turn to the 2025 objectives by the time we get to the end of the year.",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"Yes. I would just add that I think that's unknown at this point as to how much of the 2025 obligations will actually be booked or signed up in 2023.",
			"<strong>David William Barden</strong>",
			"Right. I think that, yes, that's a good point. And if I could follow up real quick, maybe Jeff, just on your comments regarding Brazil -- or maybe this was also Brendan. The -- you mentioned that if there is some sort of new agreement that evolves as a function of the Oi situation that you would change your outlook, obviously. Should the market be expecting that, that is a likelihood? Or should the market be expecting that, that's unlikely to happen in 2023?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"Yes, the market should expect that it is more likely than not, but the market should take comfort in that it will fall well within our estimated churn for Brazil that we've been putting forth now for quite some time.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi.",
			"<strong>Michael Ian Rollins</strong>",
			"Two questions, if I could. First, just curious for your current thoughts on sustaining SBA's a la carte leasing framework for the domestic business and if you have any new thoughts on the possibility of some day pivoting to a structure around comprehensive leases and comprehensive MLAs. <br/>And then just secondly, if you can unpack within the first quarter churn, the amount that specifically came from the Sprint merger decommissioning.",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"Yes. On the a la carte versus the -- what are most commonly called holistic MLAs, we're very open to whatever makes the most sense for our customers and for us. We have not -- we've done MLAs. We've not done the holistic MLAs that provide a customer with kind of all-you-can-eat equipment rights up to a specified amount in exchange for some kind of pricing benefit. Although we almost did back in 2013, 2014, we came very close to doing that. So I think you should take all that, Michael, as kind of our view that it continues our kind of opportunistic way of running the business, and we will do what's right for us and our customers at that time and that you should not assume that you won't ever see that kind of agreement from us in the future.",
			"<strong>Brendan Thomas Cavanagh</strong>",
			"And Mike, on the Sprint churn question, in the first quarter, $6.5 million of the churn, incremental churn in Q1 was related to spend.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And next, we'll hear from Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets.",
			"<strong>Brandon Lee Nispel</strong>",
			"Great. Multi-part question for you, Jeff. Can you talk about bookings activity in terms of unsigned lease applications and how that's trending this quarter from like a year-over-year perspective? <br/>Then you had mentioned a number of drivers in terms of why we should still be bullish on 5G investments, including Verizon, AT&amp;T C-bands, not being cleared T-Mobile licenses, dual-band radios and DISH. Which of these is the largest potential driver for leasing for you over the next couple of years?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"Yes, I think the -- well, the biggest drivers will be the ones that I believe are most likely. It's going to be the dual band equipment. And obviously, we need to get the T-Mobile licenses that they won and paid for freed up out of the FCC. So those will be drivers that really get -- and we know that the C-band spectrum will be clear by the end of this year, which just particularly in AT&amp;T's case, will coincide with when they'll see good availability of the dual-band 3.45 and C-band radios. <br/>So all those things, I think, are going to be positively impactful late '23, certainly into 2024. And because I answered your second question first -- oh the backlog. Yes, the backlog is probably down a little bit from where it was a year ago, but it's been holding steady for the last quarter or two.",
			"<strong>Brandon Lee Nispel</strong>",
			"Great. And one follow-up. When do you expect to see lease applications for some of these dual band radios?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"I would say second half of the year and then pick it up as you move through the end of the year. I mean they just -- I believe it might have even been just last week that the FCC approved by waiver the 3.45 and the C-band dual radio equipment from Ericsson.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And next, we'll hear from Rick Prentiss with Raymond James.",
			"<strong>Richard Hamilton Prentiss</strong>",
			"I want to follow up on Walt's question about the dividend. You mentioned that the long-term trend in the dividend, what do you think dividend payout ratio caps off? And does that kind of imply 20% growth is here for a good foreseeable future, subject to Board approval?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"Yes, I would think it's not going to be a steady 20%. I would think it will -- as it has since we started the dividend, it will decline a little bit each year or so over time, so we could -- but while still increasing at what may be the REIT industry's fastest-growing dividend, still growing at a very fast clip while we maintain a relatively low relative to our peers' AFFO payout ratio. That's been the strategy from the start, Rick.",
			"<strong>Richard Hamilton Prentiss</strong>",
			"You guys have been a very good allocator of capital. Is there a cap, I guess, obviously, you've got some international properties that are probably not covered by the REIT exclusion in the U.S. on just kind of -- does this a cap out like at 70%, 80% then you think?",
			"<strong>Brendan Thomas Cavanagh</strong>",
			"It should be much less than that. I mean maybe way out long term, I would say it's closer to 45%, 50% because ultimately, when we're through our NOLs, it will obviously match our net income, our taxable net income. So at this stage, the relationship of the taxable net income to AFFO is somewhere in that 40% to 50% range.",
			"<strong>Richard Hamilton Prentiss</strong>",
			"Okay. And then you mentioned to David's question on the Oi churn. Can you just remind us of what the total Oi churn is that's still left to be addressed possibly? And how that factored into what your total Brazil churn number was?",
			"<strong>Brendan Thomas Cavanagh</strong>",
			"Yes. So related specifically to the Oi consolidation risk, I think you're asking the total exposure we ballparked in the $25 million to $35 million range. We've -- through the TIM deal, that represents about $10 million of churn that we've locked in. That's in our 2023 guidance. There's nothing in there for anybody else at this point, none of the leases are up. So if it were to be additive to this year through an agreement, it would be pulling some of that forward. But the total range, we still think is a fair estimate over time of $25 million to $35 million of which $10 million is already in.",
			"<strong>Richard Hamilton Prentiss</strong>",
			"Follow-on for me. On the Sprint churn, follow up on Mike's question, $6.5 million was in the first quarter. And $25 million to $30 million Sprint churn is in '23. Remind us of what's left out there and kind of the time frame is what we expect coming maybe in '24, '25, '26 just so we have those carrier consolidation in that kind of make sure that the market's got those still in the models.",
			"<strong>Brendan Thomas Cavanagh</strong>",
			"Yes. It's pretty much the same as it's been in the past. Our big years are '25 and '26, where we would estimate somewhere about $45 million to $50 million in each of those years. Next year, as we sit here today, we think we'll be a little bit lower, in the $15 million to $20 million range. And then as I said, $45 million to $50 million to the following 2 years. And then there's some marginal amount after that, probably $10 million to $20 million that kind of dribbles out into the future. So that's the full exposure of what's left after this year.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Next, we'll hear from Batya Levi with UBS.",
			"<strong>Batya Levi</strong>",
			"To the extent that you move forward with holistic deals, could you talk about if that would change your view on leverage targets? And getting pretty close with investment grade and '25 seems to be a year where you have a bunch of issues coming in. Can we expect you to put that as a top priority in the near term? <br/>And then another question on the activity. Verizon suggests that lighting up more C band spectrum is not going to require new antennas -- what's your view of more C-band spectrum coming in, do you think that, that would create more activity?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"On the spectrum that the CTI wrote to the White House about? Brand new spectrum? Yes. I mean there's some antenna efficiencies that may allow that to happen depending on the spectrum, but there are no radio efficiencies. <br/>There has to be new radios that are frequency-specific. They could be dual band or multiband, but they're not in any of the equipment today for the spectrum that has not yet been auctioned. So that's a real opportunity should that spectrum become available. <br/>In terms of our leverage, one of the reasons that we -- there are several reasons, but one of the reasons that we're using our free cash flow to pay down the revolver is exactly to your point, Batya, which is to see how the Fed -- how they do in their war against inflation. <br/>If they succeed, we believe rates will come down, and we will kind of go back exactly to the way we have done business for 20 years. If it looks like it is more permanent that we're going to be in a higher rate environment and inflation doesn't come under control, then we will take a much more serious look at turning investment grade, which we're actually positioned to do fairly well and over a manageable period of time, if that's in fact what we choose to do. <br/>And I think the macro world will play itself out in the next year, and we will be able to tell you with much more specificity exactly which of those paths we're going to take.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And next, we'll hear from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.",
			"<strong>Simon William Flannery</strong>",
			"Jeff, you said the M&amp;A market was pretty slow. I wonder if you could just expand on that. Is it that there's just not much available or not much available at attractive prices? And then I was wondering if you could just also just expand on the infill comment, and we've heard a lot of bullish stuff from the telcos on FWA. And I was just wondering if you're having more conversations about if they wanted to add capacity for that, what that might mean for their build programs over the medium term.",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"Yes. In terms of M&amp;A, it's a combination of both of those things, Simon. There's just not a lot that's being offered for sale or shopped around. And that's a global comment relative to past times. I think it's a combination of the interest rate environment. And I think it's a combination -- and added to that would be the -- it's a closing gap, but there's still a gap between buyer and seller expectations. <br/>So there's really -- and we keep pretty close tabs on all opportunities out there. And there's really not a lot and even fewer that we would find attractive as evidenced by the fact that we didn't announce anything this quarter.",
			"<strong>Simon William Flannery</strong>",
			"And are you mostly looking in your existing markets? Or would you be open to new markets?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"Yes, we'd be open for the right opportunity, similar to our past practices. We would obviously be careful and thoughtful, but we're not foreclosing new markets.",
			"<strong>Simon William Flannery</strong>",
			"Great. And anything on infill, you could share on if they do decide to act...",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"Our customers have all been very -- and they haven't said anything different to us. have all been very careful to describe fixed wireless as a product that really is just for excess capacity on the 5G network. And I don't know if that will change or not. I mean, they're all -- well, the ones that are offering it more intentionally are doing very well. <br/>So I mean you could see at some point that there is specific capital allocation purely justified off of the fixed wireless. But I cannot tell you today that any activity that we're seeing is predominantly there because of fixed wireless.",
			"<strong>Simon William Flannery</strong>",
			"Right. And perhaps your comments around the CTIA study that might be a -- some of that spectrum might be good for fixed wireless as well.",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"Yes, it absolutely would be. But you're going to have to deploy at a minimum radios for that. And in most cases, probably new antennas, too.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.",
			"<strong>Philip A. Cusick</strong>",
			"So 2 different subjects, if I can. First, there's been a lot of discussion of DISH. Credit markets are concerned with what happens there. Can you remind us where at DISH your contracts lie? And if DISH were to stop building what your sort of remaining security looks like. <br/>And then second, completely different. South Africa, there's been a lot of power issues and growing power issues. Any changes in how you address this on your towers, interest and involvement in supporting the country and power and your carriers?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"I'll take the South Africa question. And Brendan, you could take the DISH question, if you know the answer. We know it's at the spectrum holding level, Phil. I mean that's probably about as best as we can -- we can get back to you with the exact legal entity, if you'd like, but it's with the entity that has the spectrum. <br/>So on the South Africa question, power is an issue, and there is a movement afoot by some carriers, particularly -- well, I'm not going to name them specifically, but to outsource power on the towers. <br/>And it is something that we're looking at. The bigger issue in South Africa and one that we're working on and hopefully, we'll have something meaningful for both us and our customers in the future is security. And you really don't want to spend a lot of money on power supply, solving those issues until you have the site facility secured. <br/>And that involves a wide range of potential solutions, Phil, which we've got a lot of folks looking at and studying, and I think we'll be able to share more with you on that over the coming year.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And next, we'll hear from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.",
			"<strong>Brett Joseph Feldman</strong>",
			"Two questions, if you don't mind. For many years now in the U.S., a lot of the new towers that have been constructed have been done by privately funded operators who keep access to capital or signing leases with their carrier tenants with terms that you just were never going to match. And as a result, we haven't seen you develop a lot of towers in the U.S. for a number of years now. <br/>I'm curious what the market for a new site development in the U.S. looks like. It would seem that with the carriers using higher frequencies than they've ever used before, there'd be some need for densification of the actual infrastructure. But I really don't know, so I'm curious whether that could be an opportunity for you. <br/>And then a separate topic, American Tower sold their Mexican fiber business, citing that it really ended up being a more difficult business than they thought. You've been pretty selective in terms of where you've invested in fiber in your international markets. I'm curious how those businesses are performing and whether maybe you're considering any portfolio going to be there as well.",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"Well, other than some assets, which are very de minimis to the operation of our data center in Brazil or our towers internationally, we don't have any fiber businesses internationally, Brett. So nothing really to divest there. <br/>In terms of new builds, over time, there should continue to be a steady, although I don't know if it will be a growing number of new build opportunities. The new build market in the U.S. has slowed somewhat as carriers have focused more on amending their existing sites to roll out most efficiently their 5G. <br/>And I will also tell you that the cost of new builds have gone up tremendously in the last 5 years. They may have doubled over that period of time. So I think that's providing a bit of a damper on activities as well.",
			"<strong>Brett Joseph Feldman</strong>",
			"Are you still seeing those same private operators out there bidding for what's available? Or has that cooled down to some degree?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"The same names are still out there, but the volumes are well down.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Brendan Lynch with Barclays.",
			"<strong>Brendan James Lynch</strong>",
			"Jeff, you mentioned the dual-band radios, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on that and what you're expecting from the carriers. Have they been holding back in anticipation of this? Or what do you really expect them to change starting in the second half once you get those applications?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"Yes. I don't want to speak for our customers. But I will tell you that the literature that's available on this topic from organizations like Light Reading, for example, really go into quite a bit of detail as to what our customers' plans are with respect to those dual-band radios, including one of our customers is said to not deploy any of certain amounts of spectrum that they already have until those dual-band radios are available. <br/>So I mean that's what I know. And I don't want to really kind of talk more about specific customer discussions. But I think if you look at that literature, you will see a picture that is very clear that there has been hold back in terms of what our customers would otherwise do pending the availability of that type of equipment. <br/>And in particular, right now, the deployment is a separate radio and antenna for C-band at 3.45. It will be a more efficient form function when they're combined. And to the extent that they work doing that in 1 truck roll with the 2 different radios, they would have the efficiencies of a single truck roll. So -- that's a long-winded way of saying, yes, we think it's going to be a positive development when that equipment is available.",
			"<strong>Brendan James Lynch</strong>",
			"Great. That's helpful. And maybe one balance sheet question for Brendan. Accounts receivable was flat quarter-to-quarter around $183 million, but it's up quite a bit relative to the trailing 12-month average prior to that. Is there anything specific that is causing that to occur?",
			"<strong>Brendan Thomas Cavanagh</strong>",
			"Not really because we obviously focus on aged accounts receivable, which are not -- which we're doing fine on collections. So a lot of that is really just timing around some of the services contracts, generally services related in terms of fluctuation of leasing.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Next question comes from David Guarino with Green Street.",
			"<strong>David Anthony Guarino</strong>",
			"Jeff, I wanted to talk about that CTIA report you mentioned. What do you think would happen to U.S. macro tower new leasing activity if the FCC was unsuccessful and they couldn't get access to new mid-band spectrum. Do you think we'd see growth trail off from the 5% rate take pretty significantly once the C-band spectrum is installed?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"Well, I think you'd see a tremendous amount of increased densification because that will be the only way to satisfy demand in a spectrum-constrained environment. The question is -- it's the age-old question, who's going to pay for that and are customers going to find a good enough return on investment? But I mean if there's no more spectrum, David, it has to be cell splitting and densification.",
			"<strong>David Anthony Guarino</strong>",
			"Okay. And I guess maybe to dive in the densification side, there's ample opportunity within your portfolio for that to happen, right? It wouldn't be fair to say during the 4G build-out, the majority of that already occurred.",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"I would say that to densify within the existing spectrum and to have no additional spectrum introduced into the system, if you were going to truly build out to the max, to achieve the max 5G capabilities, I would tell you, we have a lot of opportunity and a lot of room on our towers that would need to be filled for our customers to achieve that.",
			"<strong>David Anthony Guarino</strong>",
			"Okay. Maybe stepping outside the U.S. then it's been -- I guess, it's been over a year since you guys set up operations in the Philippines. <br/>Could you just maybe update us on how many sites you own in the country now? And then I know there was a lot of MNO tower asset sales. Are there any rumors of that on the horizon of maybe the MNOs looking to sell some more assets?",
			"<strong>Brendan Thomas Cavanagh</strong>",
			"Yes. We've got about 130 or so sites right now, but a bunch more in construction. So we would expect to end the year in the high 100s somewhere.",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"Yes. And the MNOs have followed up. I mean there are 2 real MNOs. There are 3, but 2 that really own assets over there. And those customers have continued to hive off chunks of their portfolios. I'm not sure that they've done it too many times, but I know there have been follow-ups, I think, from each of the 2 big ones there with additional asset sales.",
			"<strong>David Anthony Guarino</strong>",
			"But nothing else on the horizon that you're aware of?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"Not that we're aware of.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And next, we'll hear from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo.",
			"<strong>Eric Thomas Luebchow</strong>",
			"Just curious for the 2 large U.S. carriers that are already deploying C-band today. Any kind of rough estimates on how many of your sites have been upgraded just to give us a sense for how long the growth scale will be in the next few years?",
			"<strong>Brendan Thomas Cavanagh</strong>",
			"Below 50%.",
			"<strong>Eric Thomas Luebchow</strong>",
			"Okay. Helpful. And I guess when you think about the dual-band radios, is there any real difference in your ability to monetize amendments, whether they are a separate C band in 3.45 radio or if it's a dual band, is it relatively equivalent in terms of your amendment revenue?",
			"<strong>Brendan Thomas Cavanagh</strong>",
			"Yes. I would say it's roughly equivalent although the form factor is going to be less from a weight perspective in the dual-band unified piece of equipment.",
			"<strong>Eric Thomas Luebchow</strong>",
			"Got it. Makes sense. And just last for me. I know you've made a couple of smaller data center investments kind of studying the Edge compute market, I guess. Have you had any learnings from those or anything to report that maybe could give you some confidence to get bigger in that space over time either through new development or M&amp;A?",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"Well, where we continue to grow is in the Edge and the fiber regeneration facilities. We're now up to somewhere between 40 and 50 of those. So what we found, Eric, is that there's high demand for quality locations where you have power and permitting and fiber. What really has not happened yet to our knowledge anywhere in the globe is the direct tie-in at the edge, at the cell site to the wireless networks, which when that comes, that will unleash a tremendous amount of demand at the cell site. But we're learning a lot along the way through primarily real estate demand as opposed to demand for this computing to be tied into the wireless networks.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And next, we'll hear from Greg Williams with TD Cowen.",
			"<strong>Gregory Bradford Williams</strong>",
			"First one is on services. Your site development came in a bit stronger. Should we expect that also to sort of come down a little bit linearly? And second question is just on the dual-band radio opportunity on network services. So if T-Mobile or anything start deploying that, could we see an uptick in network services above and beyond your guidance?",
			"<strong>Brendan Thomas Cavanagh</strong>",
			"Yes, Greg, we would think that services will be declining slightly into the second half of the year, but I think at a lesser pace. I mean, you can see what our outlook looks like and where the first quarter ended up, it's only slightly ahead of that full year pace. So probably similar in the second quarter, maybe slightly less in the second half of the year, but relatively flat.",
			"<strong>Jeffrey A. Stoops</strong>",
			"Yes. And when the dual band deployment start, Greg, certainly, that's going to benefit our services business.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And we have no further questions at this time.",
			"<strong>Brendan Thomas Cavanagh</strong>",
			"Great. Well, we want to thank everyone for joining us this evening. We appreciate your participation, and we'll talk to you in a quarter. Thank you.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

			"Public Storage is likely to have gained from its solid presence in key cities and high brand value in the first quarter. PSA is also likely to have benefited from its technological advantage amid favorable market fundamentals and maintained a healthy balance sheet position.<br/><br/>In addition, the company has been capitalizing on growth opportunities. In the fourth quarter, Public Storage acquired 30 self-storage facilities comprising 1.6 million net rentable square feet of area for $228.6 million.<br/><br/>Following Dec 31, 2022, the company acquired or was under contract to buy eight self-storage facilities spanning 0.5 million net rentable square feet of space for $70.5 million. Such acquisition and expansion initiatives are anticipated to have stoked the company’s growth during the period under consideration.<br/><br/>Amid these, Public Storage is likely to have seen growth in revenues in the quarter to be reported. Also, PSA has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with adequate liquidity to bank on expansion opportunities through acquisitions and developments. This is likely to have continued in the first quarter as well.<br/><br/>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues stands at $1.09 billion. This calls for a 12.08% year-over-year increase.<br/><br/>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues from self-storage facilities stands at $1.02 billion. This suggests an increase from the $ 917.02 million witnessed in the year-ago period. Quarterly revenues from ancillary operations are presently projected at $60.60 million, ahead of the $56.43 million registered in the comparable period last year.<br/><br/>PSA’s activities during the quarter under review were adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter core FFO per share has been revised 1.5% upward to $4.07 in the past two months. It also calls for 11.5% year-over-year growth.<br/><br/>However, with the impact of the pandemic abating, vacancy is likely to increase. Furthermore, there is a development boom of self-storage units in several markets. This high supply is likely to have fueled competition. Rising interest rates add to its woes.",

			"<strong>Realty Income Corp.</strong> O is slated to report first-quarter 2023 results on May 3 after market close. As we gear up for the release of Realty Income's first-quarter 2023 earnings report, it's essential to take a closer look at the company's performance and the factors that are likely to have influenced it in this period.<br/><br/>Prior to that, let us make a quick recap of the past performances of Realty Income. In the last reported quarter, this monthly dividend-paying real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a surprise of 2.04% in terms of adjusted FFO per share. Results reflected better-than-expected revenues in the quarter. The company benefited from expansionary effects and a healthy pipeline of opportunities globally.<br/><br/>Over the trailing four quarters, Realty Income surpassed estimates on all occasions, the average surprise being 1.82%. This is depicted in the graph below:",
			"Realty Income Corporation price-eps-surprise | Realty Income Corporation Quote",
			"The first quarter of 2023 has seen its fair share of challenges in the commercial real estate market, with uncertainties surrounding interest rate hikes and global geopolitical concerns causing headwinds. Despite these challenges, Realty Income is expected to exhibit resilience in its first-quarter 2023 earnings report. Here are the main factors that have contributed to this expectation:<br/><br/>This retail REIT has a diversified tenant base and derives a majority of its annualized retail contractual rental revenues from tenants with a service, non-discretionary and/or low-price-point component to their business. Benefiting from this, the company is likely to have enjoyed stable rental revenues in the quarter.<br/><br/>Realty Income's occupancy rates have historically remained above 96%, and this trend is expected to have continued in the first quarter of 2023. High occupancy rates contribute to the company's strong cash flow and dividend payments.<br/><br/>Realty Income has been strategic in its approach to acquiring and disposing of properties, capitalizing on opportunities to maximize its returns. The company's acquisition pipeline remains strong, with a focus on high-quality assets that offer attractive risk-adjusted returns.<br/><br/>In the first quarter, Realty Income signed a definitive agreement with EG Group, a leading independent convenience retailer based in the U.K., to acquire up to 415 single-tenant convenience store properties in the United States. However, increasing interest expenses are anticipated to have cast a pall on the company’s quarterly performance.",
			"Amid these tailwinds, Realty Income’s top line is expected to have improved. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $910.82 million, suggesting a 12.82% increase from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for rental revenues (excluding reimbursable) is pegged at $816.77 million, up from the prior-year quarter’s $755.56 million.<br/><br/>Our estimate for first-quarter occupancy is currently pegged at 98.7%, while same-store rental revenues are estimated to grow 0.7% year over year.<br/><br/>The company’s activities in the to-be-reported quarter were adequate to garner analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter FFO per share has been revised a cent upward to $1.02 in the past week. The figure also implies 4.08% year-over-year growth.",
			"Our proven model predicts a surprise in terms of FFO per share for Realty Income this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is the case here.<br/><br/>Realty Income currently has a Zacks Rank of 3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.12%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br/><br/>Our model shows that <strong>Federal Realty Investment Trust</strong> FRT and <strong>Agree Realty Corporation</strong> ADC also have the right combination of elements to report a surprise this quarter.<br/><br/>Federal Realty is slated to report quarterly numbers on May 4. FRT has an Earnings ESP of +0.57% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3 presently.

			"As we await the official the first-quarter 2023 earnings release, Realty Income appears on track for another stable quarter. The company's focus on essential businesses, strong rent collection rates and anticipated FFO growth should support ongoing dividend increases. However, investors should remain vigilant about potential headwinds in the retail real estate market and keep an eye on O's payout ratio to ensure the safety and growth of their dividends.<br/><br/><br/>Note: <em>Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.</em>",

			"Data center infrastructure demand has remained robust amid growth in cloud computing, the Internet of Things and Big Data, and elevated demand for third-party IT infrastructure. Moreover, the growth in the AI, autonomous vehicles and virtual/augmented reality markets has created a solid base for data centers.<br/><br/>Amid this, Equinix is expected to have capitalized on enterprises’ growing reliance on technology and acceleration in digital transformation strategies. This is likely to have driven the demand for its geographically diverse portfolio of International Business Exchanges (IBX) data centers, benefiting its first-quarter earnings.<br/><br/>Moreover, the company’s recurring revenue model, which comprises colocation, related interconnection and managed IT infrastructure services, is expected to have led to stable cash flow generation in the to-be-reported quarter, boosting its top line.<br/><br/>Also, given the acceleration in enterprise cloud adoption and increasing cloud or Internet customers’ requirements for highly interconnected data center space, the demand for Equinix’s interconnected ecosystem in the first quarter is likely to have remained robust.<br/><br/>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for interconnection revenues is pegged at $343.03 million, suggesting growth of 10.9% from the prior-year period’s reported figure.<br/><br/>For first-quarter 2023, Equinix projected revenues between $1.965 billion and $1.995 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same stands at $1.98 billion, implying a 13.9% increase from the year-ago period’s $1.73 billion. We estimate the same to be $1.979 billion, suggesting a 14.1% year-over-year rise.<br/><br/>In addition, EQIX estimated adjusted EBITDA in the range of $891-$921 million for the quarter. Our estimate is pegged at $901 million, implying an increase of 12.7%.<br/><br/>We expect Equinix to have maintained a robust balance sheet position during the to-be-reported quarter, which might have supported its acquisitions and development activities.<br/><br/>However, higher interest expenses and adverse foreign currency fluctuations are expected to have cast a pall on its quarterly performance. Our estimate for 2023 interest expenses implies a year-over-year increase of 6.8%.<br/><br/>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter FFO per share has been revised marginally downward over the past month to $7.92. Nonetheless, on a year-over-year basis, it suggests growth of 10.6%.",
			"This March, Equinix announced that Oxford Quantum Circuits (“OQC”) aims to make one of the most powerful quantum computers commercially available to businesses worldwide through Equinix's TY11 IBX data center. OQC is a leading global Quantum Computing as a Service (QCaaS) company.<br/><br/>The move is expected to benefit businesses with the ease of access to quantum computing, making Equinix’s latest move a strategic fit.  <br/><br/>Further, in February, EQIX unveiled that it is building its second data center in Barcelona, a vital subsea hub. The new BA2 data center will serve as a strategic connection point for data communications between Europe, Africa and the Middle East, making EQIX’s move seem prudent.<br/><br/>In the same month, Equinix announced the addition of five new long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) in Spain, aggregating 225 megawatts (MW). The move considerably increased the company’s backing of renewable power projects.",

			"<strong>SBA Communications Corporation</strong> SBAC reported first-quarter 2023 adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) per share of $3.13, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.11. Moreover, the figure reflects a rise of 5.7% from the prior-year quarter.<br/><br/>SBAC’s site-leasing revenues improved year-over-year on healthy leasing activity amid elevated tower space demand. Moreover, it has continued to benefit from the addition of sites to its portfolio. The company also raised its 2023 outlook.<br/><br/>Quarterly total revenues increased 9% year over year to $675.5 million. The figure, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by just 0.1%.<br/><br/>Per Jeffrey Stoops, the president and CEO of the company, “We produced solid growth in Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share while operationally executing at a very high level. We are experiencing continued solid demand in substantially all of our markets. All of our US wireless carrier customers remain actively engaged in building out their 5G networks. Domestically and internationally, additional 5G network deployment from our customers is expected on our assets.”",
			"Site-leasing revenues were up 10.3% year over year to $617.3 million. This consisted of domestic site-leasing revenues of $454.8 million and international site-leasing revenues of $162.4 million. The domestic cash site-leasing revenues came in at $447.4 million, growing 5.6% year over year. International cash site leasing revenues came in at $163 million, jumping 27.4% year over year.<br/><br/>However, site-development revenues decreased 3.5% year over year to $58.2 million.<br/><br/>The site-leasing operating profit was $497.2 million, marking an increase of 9.9% year over year. Moreover, 97.2% of SBAC’s total operating profit in the quarter came from site leasing.<br/><br/>The overall operating income improved 3.4% to $224.1 million.<br/><br/>The adjusted EBITDA totaled $459.3 million, up 8.4%, while the adjusted EBITDA margin declined to 68.7% from 69.3% in the prior-year quarter.",
			"In the first quarter, SBAC acquired 14 communication sites for a total cash consideration of $8.6 million. The company also built 52 towers during this period. It owned or operated 39,362 communication sites as of Mar 31, 2023, of which 17,418 were in the United States and its territories and 21,944 internationally.<br/><br/>SBA Communications also spent $11.6 million to purchase land and easements and extend lease terms. Total cash capital expenditure was $69.1 million in the reported quarter, of which $57.3 million represented discretionary and $11.8 million was non-discretionary.<br/><br/>Subsequent to the quarter end, SBAC purchased or is under contract to buy 66 communication sites for a total consideration of $63.7 million in cash. It expects to complete the acquisition by the end of the fourth quarter of 2023.",
			"In the first quarter, SBA Communications generated nearly $311 million of net cash from operating activities compared with the year-ago quarter’s $292.5 million.<br/><br/>As of Mar 31, 2023, it had $152.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, up from $143.7 million recorded at the end of Dec 31, 2022. SBAC ended the quarter with a net debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDA of 6.9X.<br/><br/>As of May 1, 2023, the company had $595 million outstanding under the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility.<br/><br/>During the first quarter of 2023, SBAC did not repurchase any shares of its Class A common stock. As of May 1, 2023, it had $504.7 million of authorization remaining under its approved repurchase plan.",
			"Concurrent with the earnings release, SBAC announced a cash dividend of 85 cents on its Class A common stock. The dividend will be paid out on Jun 21 to shareholders of record as of May 26, 2023.",
			"SBAC now expects AFFO per share in the range of $12.55-$12.91, up from the prior guided range of $12.46-$12.83. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $12.62, which is within the guided range.<br/><br/>Site-leasing revenues are now projected to be $2,481-$2,501 million, revised upward from $2,469-$2,489 million guided earlier. Site-development revenue guidance remains unchanged between $205 million and $225 million.<br/><br/>Further, the adjusted EBITDA has been raised from $1,845-$1,865 million to $1,855-$1,875 million.<br/><br/>The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

			"<strong>Crown Castle Inc.</strong> CCI reported first-quarter 2023 adjusted FFO (AFFO) per share of $1.91, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.94. The figure, however, compared favorably with the year-ago period’s $1.87. Our estimate for the same was pegged at $1.98.<br/><br/>Higher operating expenses in the quarter were a deterrent. Nonetheless, the rise in site-rental revenues amid elevated tower space demand aided CCI’s year-over-year top-line growth.  The company maintained its outlook for 2023.<br/><br/><strong>Digital Realty Trust</strong> DLR reported first-quarter 2023 core FFO per share of $1.66, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a whisker. The figure, however, fell short of the year-ago quarter’s $1.67.<br/><br/>The company experienced year-over-year growth in operating revenues during the quarter. However, rising rental property operating expenses acted as a dampener. DLR maintained its guidance for 2023 core FFO per share but lowered its expectations for full-year revenues.<br/><br/><strong>American Tower Corporation</strong> AMT reported first-quarter 2023 AFFO per share, attributable to AMT common stockholders, of $2.54, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.38. The figure also surpassed our estimate of $2.44.<br/><br/>Results reflect improving revenues across its property segment. American Tower recorded healthy year-over-year organic tenant billings growth of 6.4% and total tenant billings growth of 7.3%. It also revised its 2023 outlook.<br/><br/><em>Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents FFO — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.</em>",

			"Please refer to today's press release on how to access the replay of this call. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Founder and CEO, Andy Florance.",
			"<strong>Andy Florance:</strong> Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's first quarter 2023 earnings call. Revenue for the first quarter of 2023 was $584 million, or 13% growth year-over-year coming in at the high end of our guidance range and above consensus estimates. I'm very pleased with the growth of our commercial information and non-residential marketplace businesses, which delivered 15% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter. I'm also very pleased with the progress we're making in building the new Homes.com, which I believe will become the best online residential marketplace in the world bar none. We started the year strong with net new sales of $80 million, our second highest sales quarter ever and a 17% increase over the first quarter of the prior year.",
			"Apartments.com achieved the highest net new sales quarter for the second quarter in a row. LoopNet achieved outstanding results in the quarter with a 100% increase in net new sales over the first quarter of last year. We hit a new high watermark in traffic to our marketplaces in March. Monthly unique visitors totaled $94 million for the month with Apartments.com, Homes.com, LoopNet Lands, BizBuySell, Belbex, BureauxLocaux business in all of our marketplaces contributing up to tens of millions of unique visitors. Apartments.com continued its impressive run with another outstanding quarter. Apartments.com revenue was $211 million in the first quarter, climbing to 20% year-over-year for the first time since the first quarter of 2021. Net new sales bookings were at an all-time high breaking the record set just last quarter with an increase of 110% in over the first quarter of '22.",
			"Apartments.com while very successful has millions of apartments that do not yet advertise on the site. We are focused on continuing to grow our sales force to reach this huge potential untapped audience. Our attention to attracting the best talent and excellent on-boarding and training of new hires is paying good dividends. Our sales team productivity is up over 40% compared to last year for hires who have been with us less than a year. We are committed to excellent customer service and that's a big contributor to our success. The apartment sales team conducted close to 140000 quality meetings this quarter which is 24% higher than the same quarter last year. Of those 140,000 quality meetings over 50,000 were in person, a 45% increase over the first quarter of '22.",
			"This attention to servicing continues to be well received by our clients as evidenced by our industry-leading Net Promoter Score of 94. The number of properties advertising on our platform continues to expand and is now at a record 64000 properties. Our customers are selecting higher ad package levels to obtain more leads as evidenced by our average revenue per property increase of 14% over the prior year. The economic fundamentals of the apartment industry continue to move in our favor. The vacancy rate for three, four and five-star properties rose another 30 basis points to 7.7% in the first quarter and net deliveries continue to outpace net absorption in the quarter with twice the units delivered as absorbed. Deliveries in '23 are expected to be the highest in over 40 years and vacancy rates are forecast to increase for the remainder of the year.",
			"There are currently over one million units under construction, with approximately 750,000 of them being at the top end of the market. Pressure on these assets will be intense throughout 2023 as rent levels moderate. We expect vacancy rates to remain elevated by historical standards. All this could create a jet stream like tailwind for advertising demand. March marked the official role to the new 2023 Apartments.com marketing campaign with new TV commercials, streaming videos and streaming audio commercials. Jeff Goldblum, as Brad Bellflower was featured during March Madness and all month across top networks like CVS, BRAVO, TBS, TNT, and more. We launched a new social media campaign, our streaming audio and podcast campaigns have hit the airwaves and engagements are at an all-time high.",
			"We anticipate that our 2023 campaign will yield 12 billion media impressions. The early results of this campaign are strong with our first quarter unaided brand awareness for Apartments.com jumping to our highest score ever. Apartments.com continues to attract qualified renters to our platform with an average of over 43 million monthly unique visitors in the quarter according to Google Analytics. Apartments.com is also benefiting from the addition of Homes.com rental area to its network and the tremendous growth in traffic to Homes.com. Visitors to the homes rental area up 83% since the fourth quarter of 2022 and those visitors delivered approximately 200,000 leads to our paying of Apartments.com customers, that's up 124% from just last quarter.",
			"With more content than ever before on our network including unit level details and touring capabilities our lead quality continues to outperform our competitors. Our mobile sessions were an all-time high in the first quarter with 75% of Apartments.com user sessions conducted on a mobile device. Just five keywords now account for 33% of unbranded search activity on these devices. When the top 376 cities in the United States are examined, Apartments.com ranks number for all five of these terms 99% of the time. The combination of the kickoff of our 2023 marketing campaign, market conditions and our larger and more seasoned sales teams helped continue to drive strong results. In sum, I am very pleased to report that we expect Apartments.com to deliver 22% to 23% revenue growth in 2023.",
			"I'm very excited about the progress we've made on many Homes.com initiatives in the short period of time. Last year, we laid out the key milestones for Homes.com grow, monetize and scale. The grow phase, focused on increasing traffic engaging buyers and sellers on our platform. Our initial goal in the grow phase was to achieve 25 million unique visitors, while our goal in the scale phase was to reach 50 million unique visitors. Traffic to our Homes.com network grew dramatically. We reached 27 million unique visitors in March, according to Google Analytics. Months-to-date in April traffic to Homes.com grew 53% over the same period months-to-date. As of this morning for the partial months-to-date we have already seen 28 million unique visitors to Homes.com network.",
			"Unique visitors for our Homes.com network is 88% above March of last year and traffic to our Homes.com site is up 183%, compared to last year. We are now four times the traffic levels from when we purchased Homes.com almost two years ago. By comparison, two years after we purchased Apartments.com, we'd only double the traffic. As we continue to build Homes.com and combine single-family residential with rental content from Apartments.com, we can now aggregate our traffic across both property marketplaces. In total, monthly unique visitors in March for our Apartments.com and Homes.com network was $72 million, according to Google Analytics. For the fourth quarter of 2022, Realtor.com reported 66 million monthly unique visitors while Redfin reported 44 million average monthly unique visitors.",
			"According to comScore, Homes.com unique visitors were up 153% year-over-year in March Realtor.com's monthly unique visitors decreased by 20%. Zillow's unique visitors were down 5% and Redfin's traffic increased 5% compared to March of last year. Alongside our increase in consumer traffic engagement agent engagement continues to improve. We now have approximately 1.1 million agents registered in Homes.com network up 37% for the first quarter of 2022. Active users are those who visit the site monthly have increased 64% versus last year. I believe the engagement will continue to improve as we're providing millions of free leads to agents that could generate billions of commission dollars for them under our Your Listing Your Lead Business model.",
			"In the months ahead, we're intensely focused on product development, generating proprietary content and building consumer traffic. Our team is extremely talented and singularly focused on winning. I wish I could share more detail on some of the great success stories, but I cannot for competitive reasons. With the progress we've made to-date, I remain confident that we're on track to begin monetizing Homes.com advertising product in the later part of this year. LoopNet was 63 -- revenue was $63 million for the first quarter up 16% year-over-year and accelerating from 12% growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our investment in building a direct sales force for LoopNet's paying off. Net new bookings are up 100% year-over-year, which is directly attributable to our larger and more effective sales teams.",
			"The productivity for sellers in the first year has increased in each of the last four quarters as new reps ramp and become more productive. Sales of new signature ads are up 27% year-over-year. LoopNet captured record traffic in the quarter with 14 million average monthly unique visitors to a network of marketplaces up 12% year-over-year. According to Semrush LoopNet has eight times the traffic of our nearest competitor in March. We're also seeing traffic gains in Canada as our unique visitors for LoopNet Canada in the first quarter are over five times the unique visitors of our nearest competitor there. These accomplishments and investments reinforce our position as the most popular place to find a space and give me confidence in our ability to achieve our target of 18% to 19% revenue growth in 2023.",
			"As we continue to focus on international expansion with our revenues they are expected to exceed $80 million in 2023. By revenue our international business now ranks number four behind Apartments.com, CoStar and LoopNet. We now have over 500 international employees including 200 researchers and 130 sales representatives. In Europe, we currently operate more than a dozen cities in five countries with aspirations to expand our CoStar and LoopNet products into most of these major markets. Currently, CoStar and LoopNet are only offered in the US, Canada and the United Kingdom. We believe there's a $30 billion European market for real estate information services and marketplaces, which is roughly the same size as our North American market. A key step to capturing a significant share of that market is building and selling CoStar and LoopNet on a pan-European basis.",
			"One of the core unique competencies of our research operations is our on-the-ground field research operations. Our goal over the next few years is to photograph map and document all of the commercial properties 10,000 square feet or larger roughly 1,000 square meters in 15 European countries and approximately 36 cities. We will divide each city into one kilometer grids and capture all the relevant building inventory in each area. We anticipate capturing information on more than 1.5 million properties with a combined value in the trillions of euros. We have done this before in the US, Canada and the UK, and in each instance these massive efforts have resulted in a profitable and very valuable information asset. CoStar revenue increased $225 million in the first quarter, up 13%.",
			"For each month of the quarter, we saw a record number of distinct users in CoStar and in March exceeded 140,000 distinct users. Usage of CoStar and product engagement continues to grow as evidenced by nearly 6.5 million log-ins in the first quarter, a 26% increase over the last year. During those user sessions, property searches exceeded $20 million each month and property detail views averaged 15 million a month. Whilst CoStar continues to be the premier product for real estate professionals -- brokers, significant opportunities exist for selling to new customers. We have a 75% plus penetration rate amongst brokerages with five or more brokers and continue to prospect smaller firms with an annual revenue potential of $96 million. In addition, our sales teams are focused on owners, lenders and corporations where we have a significant addressable market.",
			"We believe we have over 51,000 owner prospects, 10,000 lender prospects and almost 4,000 corporations or 50 or more locations for a total of $1.4 billion in potential revenue. For the first time this quarter, product demonstrations to these aforementioned prospects exceeded those to the broker customers and broker prospects. Overall, we're seeing slightly lower than -- slightly lower net new bookings for CoStar, but still expect double-digit revenue growth in 2023. We've releasing corporate information on 12,600 real estate investment funds and 70,000 commercial properties within those funds into CoStar. The sub-fund information helps clients understand who has capital available to invest in the commercial real estate and what sort of product types they want to invest in and where they want to invest.",
			"We continue to focus on our banking customers with our lender product. Last month marked the one-year anniversary of releasing our fully integrated solution for lenders in CoStar. Sales continued to be strong in Q1 ending our first year by breaking the 150 total client milestone. These clients spend many lender types including banks, life insurance companies, credit unions and private lenders while ranging in size from $50 million CRE portfolios to over $50 billion CRE portfolio, proving a large opportunity moving forward. Our sales pipeline for lender is strong and we expect to build on that pipeline as the solution for lenders is uniquely positioned for continued growth in this uncertain environment. The value proposition is unmatched. No other company can connect a lender's portfolio to our rich property level information and provide a fully integrated credit model that assesses refinance risks as well as stress test a portfolio for an economic downturn.",
			"We expect continued sales opportunities due to regulators calling for increased portfolio surveillance by CRE focused lenders for multiple reasons, including the concern over office properties, rising rates, refinancing risks and the threat of a potential economic downturn. I remain confident in our ability to grow CoStar revenue, given our mission-critical data ongoing product enhancements and the continued expansion and diversification, of our customer base. Although overall CRE transaction volume was down 51% year-over-year, Ten-X continues to outperform the market, with a solid 60% trade rate up 3 times that of the off-line market and up 51% in the fourth quarter of 2022. We also saw the average number of bidders per auction on the platform increased over 3.2 in the first quarter, compared to 2.6 in the fourth quarter of 2022.",
			"In Q1 2023, Ten-X saw the average asset value increased 18% over the last year from $3.3 million to $3.9 million, average winning bid price increased 29% compared to the prior year from $3.1 million up to $4 million, and the average buyer premium increased 35% over the last year from 71,000 to 97,000. I believe this indicates that our expanded sales force is delivering higher quality assets, that investors are seeking, even in a price-challenged market. With roughly $1.5 trillion of CRE debt maturing in the next 24 months, and $700 billion maturing by year-end, we expect the continued interest rate-driven market shift to drive transaction volume up. Ten-X is already seeing an increase in momentum in the second quarter, with $1.7 billion of inventory come into the platform, a 44% increase from Q2 of 2022.",
			"Ten-X remains the go-to platform for accelerated asset transactions, which buyers, sellers, brokers, lenders and special servicers, benefit from as the markets continue to shift. Our land’s business is focused on creating opportunities for our real and clients to capture more leads for their priority properties for sale, with signature ad opportunities. This business continues its consistent profitable growth with 14% year-over-year revenue growth. STR has achieved a record sales quarter with the highest net new in its history, and delivered 14% year-over-year revenue growth, on a constant currency basis compared to the first quarter of 2022. We're on track to launch our new benchmarking product this month, and execute our plan of migrating more than 175,000 users to the CoStar platform.",
			"This release will open access to new clients, including owners, hotel operators and brands that will enable execution of our integrated strategy. Owners will have clear visibility into asset performance, market performance and competitive landscape. This insight is invaluable for asset acquisition, repositioning and dispositioning. Operators, will have access to data and tools to better forecast budget, yield, manage and identify demand drivers and supply implications. Hotel brands will have a full suite to support and develop teams, franchise owners, relationships and management contracts, what's not to love about all that. Overall, higher interest rates and increased economic uncertainty have reduced transaction volumes in the market, and impacted prices since the second half of 2022.",
			"As I mentioned earlier, transaction volumes declined by over 50% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2023, in the commercial real estate markets. In addition, we're now seeing asset price declines for seven consecutive months with valuations off by 8% over that time. The office sector continues to show real weakness with vacancy rates reaching almost 13% in the first quarter Phantom vacancy rate is much higher than that. And it's matching the all-time peak seen after the great financial crisis. With continued weak demand negative net absorption and other 58 million square feet of deliveries expected in 2023, we expect vacancies to push higher for the foreseeable future. Not surprisingly, delinquency rates on commercial property loans have doubled in the past three months to 2.8% and it's probably actually higher than that.",
			"Overall sales prices for office buildings are down 26% from their peak in Q1 of 2022. Fortunately, our 10x platform is well positioned to assist with the recapitalization of those properties as they come to market. The residential housing market remains constrained. Mortgage rates are down from the earlier highs at the end of last year, but affordability is still low by historical standards. Sales of existing homes tipped higher earlier this year after 12 consecutive months of declines. Sales of new homes have trended higher since reaching a bottom last year as builders are offering incentives like rate buydowns to clear inventories. Inventories remain tight which should prevent values from declining rapidly. The retail sector continues to benefit from reduced store closures, steady demand and minimal new supply.",
			"Available retail space fell to a new all-time low of 4.7% during the first quarter, leaving it difficult to find space strong market. Industrial net absorption has slowed in the first quarter after two years of record high net absorption and tenant demand is beginning to moderate. At 4.3% the US industrial vacancy rate is half of the levels recorded 10 years ago and rents have climbed 10% over the last 12 months still a strong market. I'm very pleased with the performance of our business in the first quarter. CoStar continues to grow and remain resilient despite industry headwinds elsewhere. Apartments.com and LoopNet show accelerating countercyclical sales success. I am very optimistic about the progress we're making building traffic and value at Homes.com.",
			"We're very pleased to see our array of diverse platforms drawing more than 94 million unique visitors in March and I look forward to reporting 100 million unique visitors before too long. At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to the very capable hands of our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Wheeler.",
			"Photo by sean pollock on Unsplash",
			"<strong>Scott Wheeler:</strong> Thank you, Andy. It's a great way to start the year, again. Financially, we are certainly on track, if not slightly ahead where we expected to be this quarter and for the year. With regards to revenue and our revenue growth outlook which is a 13% total revenue growth for 2023. Now, one of our sell-side analysts recently pointed out that we have logged 50 quarters in a row of double-digit revenue growth, although we actually just completed 48 consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth, but who's counting. I actually use my favorite AI tool which I call an Excel spreadsheet to go back and figure out how many actual quarters we had double-digit growth. So it was back in 2011. So I am applying AI here at CoStar to our financial results.",
			"<strong>Andy Florance:</strong> It might just be eye.",
			"<strong>Scott Wheeler:</strong> The question of my eye sometimes. So revenue by services, CoStar revenue grew 13% in the first quarter. It was in line with our guidance expectations. CoStar expansion into new customers remain strong with new business sales consistently or slightly above the levels we've seen since mid-2021 after the pandemic. The brokers are certainly facing a tough transaction and leasing environment, which dampened new broker sales and renewal rates primarily among the very small broker shops. We expect that our revenue forecast will reflect the current market conditions, which would have CoStar revenue growing at 10% for the second quarter and for the full year of 2023. For multifamily, we added more than $35 million in year-over-year revenue during the first quarter on our way to once again achieving 20% revenue growth.",
			"Our bigger sales team is giving us the capacity to reach more and more prospective customers that have never advertised for Apartments.com. The number of paid properties increased by 8% in the first quarter of 2023 on a year-over-year basis. This is the largest volume increase we've seen since the second quarter of 2021. In addition, we're seeing more and more customers upgrading to higher level ads versus those that are downgrading to lower level ads. This net revenue contribution from the positive ad level mix is now back to the levels we saw last during the pandemic surge, which was the second quarter of 2020, which were certainly good strong high levels. Looking ahead, we expect these trends to continue with rising vacancy rates and increased productivity from our recent sales force expansion classes.",
			"So we're now forecasting revenue growth as Andy said of 23% for multifamily for the year and for the second quarter up from our prior guidance of 20% revenue growth for 2023. LoopNet revenue grew 16% in the first quarter up from 12% revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2022, thanks to the success of our dedicated LoopNet sales team. We expect 18% revenue growth for LoopNet in the second quarter of 2023 with a full year revenue growth that we now expect at the upper end of our 18% to 19% guidance range. Revenue from Information Services increased 12% in the first quarter at the upper end of the guidance range with strong results from STR and revenue contributions from our growing European businesses. We expect revenue growth for both the second quarter and the full year of 2023 to be 10% slightly above the 7% to 9% full year revenue growth guidance range that we provided in February.",
			"Our first quarter residential revenue came in at $13 million as expected. Estimated revenue for the second quarter is around $12 million with our full year 2023 revenue expectations remaining unchanged at $45 million. As a reminder, we've not assumed any revenues from Homes.com advertising products in our 2023 outlook. Other marketplace revenue contracted 4% in the first quarter of 2023, which was actually an improvement from the 10% to 13% first quarter revenue decline we expected a few months ago, as the trade rates for Ten-X that improved sequentially in the first quarter providing the extra revenue versus our forecast. We now expect revenue from other marketplaces to grow in the mid to high single-digits in the second quarter and we're increasing our full year revenue growth estimate to 11% to 12% based on the better-than-expected first quarter results.",
			"Adjusted EBITDA was $123 million in the first quarter, $7 million above the high end of our guidance range. The outperformance was primarily attributable to our strong revenue performance and the timing of marketing spend in the quarter, which we expect to reverse as we move into our peak marketing season in the second and third quarters. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 21% in the first quarter one percentage point higher than our guidance. The size of the sales force in total remains largely unchanged from where we were at the end of 2022. The Apartments and LoopNet Marketplace teams grew in the first quarter sequentially offset by modest attrition across the rest of the sales force. Our focus for the rest of 2023 is to continue to increase our sales teams in the marketplace businesses, including apartments, LoopNet lands and residential.",
			"Our contract renewal rates remain in the 90% to 91% range, while the renewal rate in the first quarter for customers who have been subscribers for five years or longer remained strong at 95%. Subscription revenue on annual contracts increased to 82% for the first quarter of 2023, up from 81% at the end of 2022 and 80% a year ago. Both CoStar and Apartments.com have our highest annual subscription concentration percentages. And as these two products grow in relative size we see our total subscription percentage increasing along with it. With a strong start to the year, we are reconfirming our revenue guidance and raising the midpoint of our guidance range. The new revenue range of $2.465 billion to $2.48 billion implies revenue growth of 13% to 14% for the year.",
			"Second quarter 2023 fee revenue is expected to range from $603 million to $608 million, representing revenue growth of approximately 13% at the midpoint. We are also reconfirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance and raising the midpoint of our guidance range. The new adjusted EBITDA forecast range is now $505 million to $520 million. Our investments in the Homes.com, residential marketplace are yielding excellent results and our investment plans remains unchanged from what we communicated in February. For the second quarter of 2023, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $118 million to $123 million, indicating a second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 20%. Before we move to Q&amp;A, I want to reassure everyone that our cash and our investments are safe and sound with no adverse impacts from the failure of the Silicon Valley Bank and the other recent banking turmoils.",
			"We also have nothing related to First Republic Bank by the way. We maintain a very conservative treasury strategy that keeps our cash with only the strongest financial institutions and in the safest short-term investments. We actively manage our deposits to maximize interest income within the confines of our low-risk investment practices. In the first quarter, our $5.1 billion of cash earned a net interest of approximately 4.1% for the quarter, producing approximately $44 million of net interest income after deducting the interest expense on our debt. Projecting these results for the rest of the year is expected to yield net interest income of approximately $195 million, which is well above our prior estimates. We're raising our outlook for non-GAAP net income per diluted share to include our latest estimate of net interest income.",
			"We now expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $1.21 to $1.24, an increase from our prior guidance of around 15%, which is $0.15 per diluted share at the midpoint. So that about wraps it up for me. You can see we're in a very strong financial position as we head into the second quarter and our growth our investment and our profit plans are all on track for another great year. So with that, I will now turn the call back over to our operator for a little bit of Q&amp;A. Hannah, back to you.",

			"SBA Communications (SBAC) reported $675.52 million in revenue for the quarter ended March 2023, representing a year-over-year increase of 9%. EPS of $3.13 for the same period compares to $1.72 a year ago.",
			"The reported revenue represents a surprise of -0.10% over the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $676.21 million. With the consensus EPS estimate being $3.11, the EPS surprise was +0.64%.",

We are proud to grow our American tribal gaming relationships, partnering with Cherokee Nation Entertainment, owned by the Cherokee Nation, one of the largest tribal nations in the U.S., as the operator of our Gold Strike property in Mississippi. We also announced a fourth loan investment with Great Wolf to fund the development of a resort adjacent to the Foxwoods Resort Casino owned by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation. Finally, in March, we continued to support Hard Rock, while incrementally expanding our international reach by purchasing senior secured notes related to the redevelopment of the Hard Rock Ottawa Casino.

In determining AFFO, the Company adjusts for certain items that are otherwise included in determining net income attributable to common stockholders, the most comparable generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") financial measure. In reliance on the exception provided by applicable rules, the Company does not provide guidance for GAAP net income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, or a reconciliation of 2023 AFFO to GAAP net income because we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the amount of the change in non-cash allowance for credit losses under ASU No. 2016-13 - Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326) (\"ASC 326\") for a future period. The non-cash change in allowance for credit losses under ASC 326 with respect to a future period is dependent upon future events that are entirely outside of the Company’s control and may not be reliably predicted, including its tenants’ respective financial performance, fluctuations in the trading price of their common stock, credit ratings and outlook (each to the extent applicable), as well as broader macroeconomic performance. Based on past results and, as disclosed in our historical financial results, the impact of these adjustments could be material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company’s reported GAAP results. For more information, see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"",

			"The above per share estimates reflect the dilutive effect of the pending 27,102,500 shares related to the January 2023 Forward Sale Agreements as calculated under the treasury stock method. VICI OP Units held by a third party are reflected as non-controlling interests and the income allocable to them is deducted from net income to arrive at net income attributable to common stockholders and AFFO; accordingly, guidance represents AFFO per share attributable to common stockholders based solely on outstanding shares of VICI common stock.",

			"<b>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</b>",

These are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be construed as alternatives to net income or as an indicator of operating performance (as determined in accordance with GAAP). We believe FFO, FFO per share, AFFO, AFFO per share and Adjusted EBITDA provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance of our business.",
			"FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that is considered a supplemental measure for the real estate industry and a supplement to GAAP measures. Consistent with the definition used by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), we define FFO as net income (or loss) attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding (i) gains (or losses) from sales of certain real estate assets, (ii) depreciation and amortization related to real estate, (iii) gains and losses from change in control, (iv) impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and (v) our proportionate share of such adjustments from our investment in unconsolidated affiliate.",
			"AFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use as a supplemental operating measure to evaluate our performance. We calculate our AFFO by adding or subtracting from FFO non-cash leasing and financing adjustments, non-cash change in allowance for credit losses, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of real estate investments, amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount, other non-cash interest expense, non-real estate depreciation (which is comprised of the depreciation related to our golf course operations), capital expenditures (which are comprised of additions to property, plant and equipment related to our golf course operations), impairment charges related to non-depreciable real estate, gains (or losses) on debt extinguishment and interest rate swap settlements, other gains (losses), other non-recurring non-cash transactions, our proportionate share of non-cash adjustments from our investment in unconsolidated affiliate (including the amortization of any basis differences) with respect to certain of the foregoing and non-cash adjustments attributable to non-controlling interest with respect to certain of the foregoing.",
			"We calculate Adjusted EBITDA by adding or subtracting from AFFO contractual interest expense (including the impact of the forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury locks) and interest income (collectively, interest expense, net), income tax expense and our proportionate share of such adjustments from our investment in unconsolidated affiliate.",
			"These non-GAAP financial measures: (i) do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP; (ii) should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities; and (iii) are not alternatives to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. In addition, these measures should not be viewed as measures of liquidity, nor do they measure our ability to fund all of our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders, to fund capital improvements, or to make interest payments on our indebtedness. Investors are also cautioned that FFO, FFO per share, AFFO, AFFO per share and Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate companies, including REITs, due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. Our presentation of these measures does not replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP.",

			"\"Our Q1 2023 results represent a strong start to the year. Favorable supply and demand fundamentals continued, met by excellent execution from our best-in-class teams and platform. Looking ahead, we remain bullish on our business, which is backed by the high-value proposition and exceptional service that we offer our residents, along with what we believe is the strongest balance sheet and liquidity position in the single-family rental sector. With the benefits of a worry-free leasing lifestyle as attractive as ever, and the low supply of well-located, high-quality for-lease housing persisting in our markets, we believe we are well positioned to continue delivering strong results.\"",

			"Financial and operating measures found in the Earnings Release and Supplemental Information include certain measures used by Invitation Homes management that are measures not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"). These measures are defined herein and, as applicable, reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures.",
			"<b>Financial Results</b>",
			"<i>Net Income</i>",
			"Year over year, net income per diluted common share for Q1 2023 increased 29.0% to $0.20, primarily due to an increase in total revenues.",
			"<i>Core FFO</i>",
			"Year over year, Core FFO per share for Q1 2023 increased 9.5% to $0.44, primarily due to NOI growth.",
			"<i>AFFO</i>",
			"Year over year, AFFO per share for Q1 2023 increased 9.0% to $0.38, primarily due to the increase in Core FFO per share described above.",
			"<b>Operating Results</b>",
			"<i>Same Store NOI</i>",
			"For the Same Store Portfolio of 77,016 homes, Same Store NOI for Q1 2023 increased 5.0% year over year on Same Store Core Revenues growth of 7.7% and Same Store Core Operating Expenses growth of 14.0%.",
			"<i>Same Store Core Revenues</i>",
			"Same Store Core Revenues growth for Q1 2023 of 7.7% year over year was primarily driven by an 8.5% increase in Average Monthly Rent, and a 7.3% increase in other income, net of resident recoveries, partially offset by a 40 basis points year over year decline in Average Occupancy and a 30 basis points year over year increase in bad debt as a percentage of gross rental revenue. Bad debt as a percentage of gross rental revenue was 2.0% for Q1 2023, consistent with Q4 2022 as reported and better than anticipated as a result of improved payment actions that offset the significant decline in government rental assistance.",
			"<i>Same Store Core Operating Expenses</i>",
			"Same Store Core Operating Expenses for Q1 2023 increased 14.0% year over year, representing a favorable result as compared to the Company's initial guidance expectations for first quarter growth in the mid-teens. The year over year increase was primarily driven by an increase in property tax expense due to an expected year over year increase in property taxes in addition to the underaccrual of property tax expense in the first three quarters of 2022, as well as increases in utilities and property administrative expenses, net of resident recoveries; turnover expenses, net of resident recoveries; and personnel, leasing and marketing expenses.",
			"<b>Investment Management Activity</b>",
			"Acquisitions for Q1 2023 totaled 194 homes for $67 million, primarily sourced from the Company's builder partners. This included 181 wholly owned homes for $62 million in addition to 13 homes for $5 million in the Company's joint ventures.",
			"Dispositions for Q1 2023 included 284 wholly owned homes for gross proceeds of $95 million and 13 homes for gross proceeds of $6 million in the Company's joint ventures.",
			"<b>Balance Sheet and Capital Markets Activity</b>",
			"As of March 31, 2023, the Company had $1,325 million in available liquidity through a combination of unrestricted cash and undrawn capacity on its revolving credit facility. The Company's total indebtedness as of March 31, 2023 was $7,829 million, consisting of $5,775 million of unsecured debt and $2,054 million of secured debt.

			"As previously announced in March 2023, the Company's issuer and issue-level credit ratings were upgraded by S&amp;P Global Ratings to 'BBB' from 'BBB-' with a Stable outlook. In addition, as previously announced in April 2023, Moody's Investors Service revised the Company's rating outlook to 'Positive' from 'Stable'. The Company has no debt reaching final maturity prior to 2026, 99.2% of its debt is fixed or swapped to fixed, and 83.1% of its homes are unencumbered.",
			"<b>Dividend</b>",
			"As previously announced on April 28, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on or before May 26, 2023, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 10, 2023.",
			"<b>FY 2023 Guidance</b>",

Additionally, a reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures of Core FFO per share, AFFO per share, Same Store Core Revenues growth, Same Store Core Operating Expenses growth, and Same Store NOI growth to the comparable GAAP financial measures cannot be provided without unreasonable effort because the Company is unable to reasonably predict certain items contained in the GAAP measures, including non-recurring and infrequent items that are not indicative of the Company's ongoing operations. Such items include, but are not limited to, impairment on depreciated real estate assets, net (gain)/loss on sale of previously depreciated real estate assets, share-based compensation, casualty loss, non-Same Store revenues, and non-Same Store operating expenses. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on the Company's GAAP results for the guidance period.",

			"<b><span>Glossary and Reconciliations</span></b>",
			"<b>Average Monthly Rent</b>",
			"Average monthly rent represents average monthly rental income per home for occupied properties in an identified population of homes over the measurement period, and reflects the impact of non-service rental concessions and contractual rent increases amortized over the life of the lease.",
			"<b>Average Occupancy</b>",
			"Average occupancy for an identified population of homes represents (i) the total number of days that the homes in such population were occupied during the measurement period, divided by (ii) the total number of days that the homes in such population were owned during the measurement period.",
			"<b>Core Operating Expenses</b>",
			"Core operating expenses for an identified population of homes reflect property operating and maintenance expenses, excluding any expenses recovered from residents.",
			"<b>Core Revenues</b>",
			"Core revenues for an identified population of homes reflects total revenues, net of any resident recoveries.",
			"<b>EBITDA, EBITDA<i>re</i>, and Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i></b>",
			"EBITDA, EBITDA<i>re,</i> and Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> are supplemental, non-GAAP measures often utilized to evaluate the performance of real estate companies. The Company defines EBITDA as net income or loss computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") before the following items: interest expense; income tax expense; depreciation and amortization; and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"Nareit\") recommends as a best practice that REITs that report an EBITDA performance measure also report EBITDA<i>re.</i> The Company defines EBITDA<i>re</i>, consistent with the Nareit definition, as EBITDA, further adjusted for gain on sale of property, net of tax, impairment on depreciated real estate investments, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> is defined as EBITDA<i>re</i> before the following items: share-based compensation expense; severance; casualty losses, net; (gains) losses on investments in equity securities, net; and other income and expenses. EBITDA, EBITDA<i>re,</i> and Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> are used as supplemental financial performance measures by management and by external users of the Company's financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks. Set forth below is additional detail on how management uses EBITDA, EBITDA<i>re,</i> and Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> as measures of performance.",
			"The GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA, EBITDA<i>re,</i> and Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> is net income or loss. EBITDA, EBITDA<i>re,</i> and Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> are not used as measures of the Company's liquidity and should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company's EBITDA, EBITDA<i>re,</i> and Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> may not be comparable to the EBITDA, EBITDA<i>re,</i> and Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i> of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definitions of EBITDA, EBITDA<i>re,</i> and Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i>. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Company's basis for computing these non-GAAP measures is comparable with that of other companies. See below for a reconciliation of GAAP net income to EBITDA, EBITDA<i>re,</i> and Adjusted EBITDA<i>re</i>.",
			"<b>Funds from Operations (FFO), Core Funds from Operations (Core FFO), and Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO)</b>",
			"FFO, Core FFO, and Adjusted FFO are supplemental, non-GAAP measures often utilized to evaluate the performance of real estate companies. FFO is defined by Nareit as net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets, plus depreciation, amortization and impairment of real estate assets, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures.",
			"The Company believes that FFO is a meaningful supplemental measure of the operating performance of its business because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization. Because real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, management considers FFO an appropriate supplemental performance measure as it excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, impairment on depreciated real estate investments, gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated homes, as well non-controlling interests, from GAAP net income or loss.",
			"The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Core FFO and Adjusted FFO is net income or loss. Core FFO and Adjusted FFO are not used as measures of the Company's liquidity and should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company's Core FFO and Adjusted FFO may not be comparable to the Core FFO and Adjusted FFO of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of Core FFO and Adjusted FFO. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Company's basis for computing these non-GAAP measures is comparable with that of other companies. See \"Reconciliation of FFO, Core FFO, and Adjusted FFO\" for a reconciliation of GAAP net income to FFO, Core FFO, and Adjusted FFO.",
			"<b>Net Operating Income (NOI)</b>",
			"NOI is a non-GAAP measure often used to evaluate the performance of real estate companies. The Company defines NOI for an identified population of homes as rental revenues and other property income less property operating and maintenance expense (which consists primarily of property taxes, insurance, HOA fees (when applicable), market-level personnel expenses, repairs and maintenance, leasing costs, and marketing expense). NOI excludes: interest expense; depreciation and amortization; property management expense; general and administrative expense; impairment and other; gain on sale of property, net of tax; (gains) losses on investments in equity securities, net; other income and expenses; management fee revenues; and income from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.",
			"The GAAP measure most directly comparable to NOI is net income or loss. NOI is not used as a measure of liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company's NOI may not be comparable to the NOI of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of NOI. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Company's basis for computing this non-GAAP measure is comparable with that of other companies.",
			"The Company believes that Same Store NOI is also a meaningful supplemental measure of the Company's operating performance for the same reasons as NOI and is further helpful to investors as it provides a more consistent measurement of the Company's performance across reporting periods by reflecting NOI for homes in its Same Store Portfolio.",
			"See below for a reconciliation of GAAP net income to NOI for the Company's total portfolio and NOI for its Same Store Portfolio.",
			"<b>Recurring Capital Expenditures or Recurring CapEx</b>",
			"Recurring Capital Expenditures or Recurring CapEx represents general replacements and expenditures required to preserve and maintain the value and functionality of a home and its systems as a single-family rental.",
			"<b>Rental Rate Growth</b>",
			"Rental rate growth for any home represents the percentage difference between the monthly rent from an expiring lease and the monthly rent from the next lease, and, in each case, reflects the impact of any amortized non-service rent concessions and amortized contractual rent increases. Leases are either renewal leases, where the Company's current resident chooses to stay for a subsequent lease term, or a new lease, where the Company's previous resident moves out and a new resident signs a lease to occupy the same home.",
			"<b>Revenue Collections</b>",
			"Revenue collections represent the total cash received in a given period for rental revenues and other property income (including receipt of late payments that were billed in prior months) divided by the total amounts billed in that period. When a payment plan is in place with a resident, amounts are considered to be billed at the time they would have been billed based on the terms of the original lease, not the terms of the payment plan. \"Historical average\" revenue collections as a percentage of billings refer to revenue collections as a percentage of billings for the period from October 2019 through and including March 2020.",
			"<b>Same Store / Same Store Portfolio</b>",
			"Same Store or Same Store portfolio includes, for a given reporting period, wholly owned homes that have been stabilized and seasoned, excluding homes that have been sold, homes that have been identified for sale to an owner occupant and have become vacant, homes that have been deemed inoperable or significantly impaired by casualty loss events or force majeure, homes acquired in portfolio transactions that are deemed not to have undergone renovations of sufficiently similar quality and characteristics as the existing Invitation Homes Same Store portfolio, and homes in markets that the Company has announced an intent to exit where the Company no longer operates a significant number of homes.",
			"Homes are considered stabilized if they have (i) completed an initial renovation and (ii) entered into at least one post-initial renovation lease. An acquired portfolio that is both leased and deemed to be of sufficiently similar quality and characteristics as the existing Invitation Homes Same Store portfolio may be considered stabilized at the time of acquisition.",
			"Homes are considered to be seasoned once they have been stabilized for at least 15 months prior to January 1<sup>st</sup> of the year in which the Same Store portfolio was established.",
			"The Company believes presenting information about the portion of its portfolio that has been fully operational for the entirety of a given reporting period and its prior year comparison period provides investors with meaningful information about the performance of the Company's comparable homes across periods and about trends in its organic business.",
			"<b>Total Homes / Total Portfolio</b>",
			"Total homes or total portfolio refers to the total number of homes owned, whether or not stabilized, and excludes any properties previously acquired in purchases that have been subsequently rescinded or vacated. Unless otherwise indicated, total homes or total portfolio refers to the wholly owned homes and excludes homes owned in joint ventures.",
			"<b>Turnover Rate</b>",
			"Turnover rate represents the number of instances that homes in an identified population become unoccupied in a given period, divided by the number of homes in such population.",

			"\"We are off to a good start to 2023 and as a result are increasing our full year outlook for most key metrics,\" commented Jeffrey A. Stoops, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We produced solid growth in Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO per share while operationally executing at a very high level. The material number of towers we added to our portfolio in 2022 are performing ahead of plan. We are experiencing continued solid demand in substantially all of our markets. All of our US wireless carrier customers remain actively engaged in building out their 5G networks. Due to that customer activity, our services personnel are staying very busy. Internationally, growth in the first quarter remained strong, driven by organic lease-up, CPI-based escalators and portfolio growth. Domestically and internationally, much additional 5G network deployment from our customers is expected on our assets. Our balance sheet remains very strong, and our net debt/Adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio is near multi-year lows, and we have no refinancing obligations until October of 2024. Our cash flows continue to grow, providing multiple opportunities for the creation of additional shareholder value. We materially increased our cash dividend while maintaining a cash dividend / AFFO per share ratio of only 27%. We believe the future is very bright, and we are excited to support our customers in the advancement of wireless networks across all of our markets.\"",

With respect to the Company’s expectations regarding all of these statements, including its financial and operational guidance, such risk factors include, but are not limited to: (1) the impact of recent macro-economic conditions, including increasing interest rates, inflation and financial market volatility on (a) the ability and willingness of wireless service providers to maintain or increase their capital expenditures, (b) the Company’s business and results of operations, and on foreign currency exchange rates and (c) consumer demand for wireless services, (2) the economic climate for the wireless communications industry in general and the wireless communications infrastructure providers in particular in the United States, Brazil, South Africa, Tanzania, and in other international markets; (3) the Company’s ability to accurately identify and manage any risks associated with its acquired sites, to effectively integrate such sites into its business and to achieve the anticipated financial results; (4) the Company’s ability to secure and retain as many site leasing tenants as planned at anticipated lease rates; (5) the Company’s ability to manage expenses and cash capital expenditures at anticipated levels; (6) the impact of continued consolidation among wireless service providers in the U.S. and internationally, on the Company’s leasing revenue and the ability of Dish to compete as a nationwide carrier; (7) the Company’s ability to successfully manage the risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates; (8) the Company’s ability to secure and deliver anticipated services business at contemplated margins; (9) the Company’s ability to acquire land underneath towers on terms that are accretive; (10) the Company’s ability to obtain future financing at commercially reasonable rates or at all; (11) the Company’s ability to achieve the new builds targets included in its anticipated annual portfolio growth goals, which will depend, among other things, on obtaining zoning and regulatory approvals, availability of labor and supplies, and other factors beyond the Company’s control that could affect the Company’s ability to build additional towers in 2023; and (12) the Company’s ability to meet its total portfolio growth, which will depend, in addition to the new build risks, on the Company’s ability to identify and acquire sites at prices and upon terms that will provide accretive portfolio growth, competition from third parties for such acquisitions and our ability to negotiate the terms of, and acquire, these potential tower portfolios on terms that meet our internal return criteria.",

With respect to the repurchases under the Company’s stock repurchase program, the amount of shares repurchased, if any, and the timing of such repurchases will depend on, among other things, the trading price of the Company’s common stock, which may be positively or negatively impacted by the repurchase program, market and business conditions, the availability of stock, the Company’s financial performance or determinations following the date of this announcement in order to use the Company’s funds for other purposes.

			"We have included these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that they provide investors additional tools in understanding our financial performance and condition.",
			"Specifically, we believe that:",
			"(1) Cash Site Leasing Revenue and Tower Cash Flow are useful indicators of the performance of our site leasing operations;",
			"(2) Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance;",
			"(3) FFO, AFFO and AFFO per share, which are metrics used by our public company peers in the communication site industry, provide investors useful indicators of the financial performance of our business and permit investors an additional tool to evaluate the performance of our business against those of our two principal competitors. FFO, AFFO, and AFFO per share are also used to address questions we receive from analysts and investors who routinely assess our operating performance on the basis of these performance measures, which are considered industry standards. We believe that FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate financial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset impairment and decommission costs). We believe that AFFO and AFFO per share help investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as they include (1) the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures and exclude the impact of (1) our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset impairment and decommission costs) and (2) certain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed escalations and rent free periods and the non-cash portion of our reported tax provision. GAAP requires rental revenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be recognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment terms call for fixed escalations, or rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the contract. We only use AFFO as a performance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary investment. We believe our definition of FFO is consistent with how that term is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\") and that our definition and use of AFFO and AFFO per share is consistent with those reported by the other communication site companies;",

The company has been steadily expanding its footprint and diversifying its operations. As the market anticipates the earnings announcement, this article provides an in-depth preview of EXR’s expected performance in the first quarter of 2023 considering overall industry trends, the company's growth strategy and recent acquisitions.<br/><br/>In the last reported quarter, this Salt Lake City, Utah-based REIT delivered a surprise of 0.48% in terms of core funds from operations (FFO) per share. Results reflected a better-than-anticipated top line.<br/><br/>Over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on each occasion, the average beat being 3.58%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:",
			"Extra Space Storage Inc price-eps-surprise | Extra Space Storage Inc Quote",
			"Extra Space Storage has been pursuing a multi-faceted growth strategy, which includes strategic acquisitions, third-party management services and joint ventures. In recent years, the company has successfully executed several acquisitions that have expanded its portfolio, increased market share and added value for shareholders.<br/><br/>In the first quarter too, Extra Space Storage is likely to have continued to benefit from its solid presence in key cities and measures to boost its geographical footprint through accretive acquisitions and third-party management. In addition, EXR's ongoing focus on enhancing the customer experience through technology integration and improved operational efficiency is likely to strengthen its competitive advantage.<br/><br/>High brand value and technological advantage are expected to have aided Extra Space Storage’s top and bottom lines in the quarter under consideration. Also, this REIT is likely to have maintained a healthy balance sheet position.<br/><br/>However, with the pandemic’s impact waning, the self-storage industry is witnessing an elevation in vacating activity, resulting in falling occupancy levels. Tenants are likely to revert to more normal move-out behavior, leading to adverse pressure on rate growth in many markets. With a return of seasonality, rates and occupancy are likely to experience some pressure.<br/><br/>However, EXR operates in a highly fragmented market in the United States, with intense competition from numerous private, regional and local operators. In addition, there is a development boom of self-storage units in several markets. This high supply is likely to have fueled competition. Also, a hike in the interest rate is a concern for Extra Space Storage. Rising rates imply higher borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate.",
			"The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $439.25 million for quarterly property rental revenues suggests a slight increase from the prior quarter’s $438.10 million and the year-ago period’s $379.81 million. Management and franchise fees for the quarter are projected at $21.25 million, almost flat sequentially but ahead of the year-ago quarter’s $19.96 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $513.68 million for quarterly revenues suggests a 15.81% increase year over year.<br/><br/>Extra Space Storage’s activities during the quarter were not adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly core FFO per share has moved a cent south to $2.05 in the past month. However, it calls for a 1.99% year-over-year rise.",
			"Our proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for Extra Space Storage this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is not the case here.<br/><br/>Extra Space Storage currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br/><br/>However, our model shows that <strong>Americold Realty Trust, Inc.</strong> COLD and <strong>Xenia Hotels &amp; Resorts, Inc.</strong> XHR have the right combination of elements to report a surprise this quarter.<br/><br/>Americold Realty Trust, scheduled to report quarterly numbers on May 4, has an Earnings ESP of +17.72% and carries a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see <strong>the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br/><br/>Xenia Hotels &amp; Resorts is slated to report quarterly numbers on May 2.

			"With a strong market position, a diversified portfolio and commitment to enhancing customer experience through technological advancements, Extra Space Storage is likely to maintain its upward trajectory in the foreseeable future. As a result, the company presents an attractive investment opportunity for those seeking exposure to the thriving self-storage sector.<br/><br/>However, investors should also consider potential risks and uncertainties, such as interest rate fluctuations and macroeconomic factors, before making any investment decisions. Stay tuned for the first-quarter 2023 earnings release to gain insights into EXR’s performance and prospects.<br/><br/>Note: <em>Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.</em>",

			"Chicago, IL – May 1, 2023 – Stocks in this week’s article are Dutch Bros Inc. BROS, UBS Group AG UBS, CoStar Group, Inc. CSGP and Semtech Corp. SMTC.",
			"Toxic stocks may prove to be a threat to the performance of a portfolio. Such stocks may appear lucrative at first but turn out to be risky as one digs deeper. The risk of owning toxic stocks can be eliminated if investors remain vigilant about the performance of every stock that they own in their portfolio.",
			"The performance of a stock mainly depends on the underlying strength of the company, which, in turn, is dependent on financial flexibility, legal standing and management’s decisions. Most companies issue debt to raise money to grow their businesses. But the problem begins when those companies are unable to generate enough profits to pay off their liabilities. Stock prices of such insolvent companies get wiped out within a few days or even within a few hours.",
			"Such companies can be identified by careful examination of their financial statements, which reflect the financial position of the company. If the intrinsic value of the company appears lower than its stock price, the stock becomes overvalued and is prone to losing its value over time. This is when investors should consider discarding the stock.",
			"The stock price of a company also depends on management’s decision and legal challenges associated with the company. If management is inexperienced or has a track record of making poor decisions, the company’s future and ultimately the performance of the stock are bound to go downhill. Investors can prevent themselves from such risks by keeping abreast of latest news on the company.",
			"Diversification offers an opportunity to avoid the magnitude of losses associated with the risk of owning toxic stocks. Through diversification, one can invest in different stocks from different asset classes to limit their exposure to a particular stock.",
			"The detection and removal of a toxic stock at the correct time is crucial to overall portfolio health. If investors can accurately determine toxic stocks, they can take advantage of short selling, which is the process of selling stock at higher prices and buying them back at lower prices.",
			"<strong>Dutch Bros Inc.</strong>, <strong>UBS Group AG</strong>, <strong>CoStar Group, Inc.</strong> and <strong>Semtech Corp.</strong> are a few toxic stocks that you should dump from your portfolio.",
			"Here are four of the 25 toxic stocks that showed up on the screen:",

For more cities, head on over to <strong><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:5 Most Expensive Cities Around the World to Rent an Apartment;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/5-most-expensive-cities-around-the-world-to-rent-an-apartment-1144149/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">5 Most Expensive Cities Around the World to Rent an Apartment</a>. </strong>",
			"Rental costs have been one of the biggest contributors to inflation, which has impacted both developed and developing economies. The housing market was first shaken due to the coronavirus pandemic. Lockdowns and work from home trends changed the industry dynamics. Researchers from the University of California in a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:freshly published;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137722000821\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">freshly published</a> research paper share that the relocation trends due to remote work indicate that workers who had previously worked in urban areas preferred to move to cheaper suburban areas if they were allowed to work remotely full time.",
			"This shift also sees the workers move from high productivity cities to low productivity areas, but interestingly, it also features a classic illustration of the age-old adage of 'the grass is always greener on the other side.' This is because the researchers discovered that while workers in urban areas preferred a suburban environment, those in the suburban areas preferred the amenities of city life and moved to urban areas even though the rents were higher. A <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:report;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28876/w28876.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) also corroborates these conclusions, describing them as a 'donut effect' where city centers hollow out as people shift outwards to the suburban areas of the same cities. The NBER adds that in the post pandemic work environment, people will most likely follow a hybrid working model, where they commute to work for some days while staying home for others.",
			"Researchers from Princeton, Georgetown, University of California, and Columbia share that this trend of well established and high income workers moving away from city centers is likely to affect the services industry since they often spend large amounts of money at these establishments. They <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:share;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0166046222000011?token=B99673FE5A8E500608856FD773C7F08E397B9E242C7FA853FB18B935644A11E88DD53632C559286AAA9DA9838739D81D&amp;originRegion=eu-west-1&amp;originCreation=20230429203138\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">share</a> that rents in areas with high proportion of business service workers dropped in the wake of the pandemic, and this decline in rental prices started from March 2020 and persisted until January 2021. They add that this outward migration can also help drive down rents in city centers over the long term.",
			"However, while the rents dropped until 2021 start, what happened next? Well, as expected, they went up. At least this is what a report from Knight Frank shows. Their <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:report;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://content.knightfrank.com/research/357/documents/en/prime-global-rental-index-q3-2022-9628.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> for the third quarter of 2022 shows that during the twelve-month period ending in Q3 2022, global prime rents grew by 10.2%, with London leading the charge through a 19% annual growth in Q3 which had nevertheless slowed down from the 27% growth in Q2. Overall, prime rental growth peaked at 11.9% in Q1 and ended up slowing down in the third quarter. Knight Frank's <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:report;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://content.knightfrank.com/research/357/documents/en/prime-global-rental-index-q4-2022-10013.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> for the fourth quarter says prime rent growth increased slightly to 10.3% with Singapore's rents growing by a whopping 28%.

			"Real estate is one of the biggest and most lucrative industries on the planet. Diving straight into multiple market research reports, we can gauge just how valuable the real estate industry is. A <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:research report;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/real-estate-market-A06029\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">research report</a> from Allied Markets Research shows that the global real estate market was worth a whopping $28 trillion in 2021. As if this weren't enough, the research firm adds that from then until 2031, the sector will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.3% to be worth an estimated $48.9 trillion by the end of the forecast period. A report from Grand View Research has more conservative revenue estimates for the industry. The <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:report;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/real-estate-market\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> shares that in 2021 the sector was worth $3.69 trillion and will grow at a CAGR of 5.2% until 2030 to sit at an estimated $5.85 trillion worth. Within the industry, Asia Pacific is the fastest growing region as its rapid economic progress opens up the need for all types of buildings, both residential and commercial. Within Asia, China is the dominant player as it accounts for more than half of the market share.",
			"As the real estate industry booms, rents are going up as well. The U.S., as well as other developed economies, are facing historic inflation these days which picked off last year. The Russian invasion of Ukraine came just when expansionary fiscal policies to counter the coronavirus pandemic's devastating impact on the economy were seeing their after effects in the market. Stimulus packages and historically low interest rates led to trillions of dollars of cash sloshing around the American economy. This led to more purchases and aggressive business spending. While all these are good for economic growth, they also lead to inflation, and the Russian invasion turbocharged this by also shaking up the global energy markets.",
			"However, while the impact of high energy prices on inflation has started to come recede, rent continues to drive inflation up. According to the Department of Labor's report for inflation in March 2023, inflation was 5% in the month. However, for March, out of all the items that are used to calculate the inflation reading, shelter prices were among the fastest growth. Month over month, they rose at 0.6%, joining the costs of food away from home and medical care commodities.",
			"Commenting on the growth in rent costs, the Labor Department <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:stated;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">stated</a>:",

			"<strong>Devin W. Stockfish</strong>",
			"Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter GAAP earnings of $151 million or $0.21 per diluted share on net sales of $1.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $395 million, a 7% increase over the fourth quarter of 2022. These are solid results, and I'm pleased with the operational and financial performance delivered by our team despite various market and weather-related challenges throughout the quarter. Turning now to our first quarter business results. I'll begin with Timberlands on Pages 6 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $120 million to first quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $188 million, a 25% increase compared to the fourth quarter. <br/>In the West, adjusted EBITDA increased $33 million compared to the fourth quarter, largely driven by increased sales volumes in domestic and Chinese markets and lower per unit log and haul costs. These favorable results were partially offset by lower sales realizations. Turning to the Western domestic market. Demand and pricing for domestic logs faced downward pressure at the start of the first quarter. Mills reduced consumption in response to lower pricing and takeaway of finished products, and we're carrying elevated log inventories. <br/>As the quarter progressed, log consumption increased as end market demand improved, but log supply was constrained by consistent winter weather conditions. This dynamic drove log inventories to lower levels and cause log pricing to stabilize. For the quarter, our average domestic sales realizations were significantly lower than the fourth quarter. Our fee harvest and domestic sales volume as well as per unit log and haul costs improved in the first quarter as we return to full run rate operations following the work stoppage in the fourth quarter. <br/>First quarter harvest activity included a portion of the deferred volume resulting from the work stoppage, and we remain on track to capture the majority of the deferred harvest volume in 2023. Forest and road costs were also seasonally lower. Moving to our Western export business. Log markets in Japan continued to soften in the first quarter in response to elevated inventories of European lumber imports as well as lower consumption driven by reduced post-and-beam housing activity. <br/>As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to Japan were moderately lower compared to the fourth quarter, and our sales volumes were comparable. In China, log inventories at the ports declined during the quarter and daily takeaway increased as construction activity improved following the Lunar New Year and in response to the recent lifting of pandemic-related restrictions. <br/>As a result, log demand from our customers remained solid in the first quarter. Our sales volumes increased significantly compared to the fourth quarter and we intentionally flexed additional volumes to China to take advantage of improving market conditions in the first quarter. <br/>Our average sales realizations were slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter aided by improved ocean freight rates and a favorable exchange rate. Turning to the South. Adjusted EBITDA for Southern Timberlands increased $4 million compared to the fourth quarter. Despite reduced log consumption in response to lower finished product pricing and demand, southern sawlog and fiber markets remain fairly balanced during the first quarter as log supply was constrained by wet weather conditions. <br/>As a result, our average sales realizations were comparable to the fourth quarter. Our fee harvest volumes increased slightly despite the adverse weather conditions. Per unit log and haul costs were slightly lower in the first quarter, and forestry and road costs were slightly higher. Adjusted EBITDA in the North was comparable to the fourth quarter. <br/>Turning to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on Pages 10 and 11. And Real estate and ENR contributed $53 million to first quarter earnings and $89 million to adjusted EBITDA. First quarter EBITDA was $43 million higher than the fourth quarter primarily due to a significant increase in real estate acres sold, partially offset by a decrease in royalty income from our Energy and Natural Resources business. Similar to prior years, our real estate activities in 2023 and are more heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. Average price per acre decreased compared to the fourth quarter due to the mix of properties sold but remained elevated compared to historical levels, as we continue to benefit from steady demand for HBU properties. Despite broader macroeconomic headwinds, buyers continue to seek the safety of hard assets, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value. <br/>Moving to Wood Products on Pages 12 through 14. Wood Products generated $95 million of earnings in the first quarter and $148 million of adjusted EBITDA. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was a 25% reduction from the fourth quarter, largely driven by continued softening in wood products pricing. Regarding the lumber and OSB markets, benchmark prices for both products entered the first quarter showing signs of stabilization after receding in the back half of 2022. Pricing for both products increased slightly through early February in response to stronger-than-expected demand for housing and buyers replenishing lean inventories. The increase was more pronounced for lumber as supply concerns weighed on the market following a series of mill curtailment announcements, particularly in British Columbia. <br/>As the quarter progressed, overall buyer sentiment remains cautious. As adverse weather impacted homebuilding in several regions and in response to ongoing concerns about inflation and the economy. Despite lean inventories, orders were limited to necessity purchases through quarter end, and benchmark prices for both products were generally range bound. I would note, however, that prices for both products have trended higher as we've moved into the second quarter. <br/>Adjusted EBITDA for our lumber business was comparable to the fourth quarter. Both the framing lumber composite pricing and our average sales realizations decreased 9% in the first quarter. Our sales and production volumes increased significantly versus the fourth quarter which was impacted by the work stoppage at our Northwest mills. Reliability also improved across the system. With increased production in the quarter, unit manufacturing costs improved significantly. Log costs were comparable to the fourth quarter. OSB adjusted EBITDA decreased by $32 million compared to the fourth quarter, primarily due to the decrease in commodity pricing. <br/>Our average sales realizations decreased by 20% in the first quarter, largely in line with OSB composite pricing. Sales volumes were significantly higher as production volumes increased from less planned downtime for annual maintenance and transportation networks improved following adverse weather conditions late in the fourth quarter. Unit manufacturing costs and fiber costs improved moderately during the quarter. <br/>Adjusted EBITDA for Engineered Wood Products decreased by $28 million compared to the fourth quarter due to softening demand for EWP products. As a result, our sales and production volumes and average sales realizations were lower for most products in the first quarter. That said, we have seen a recent uptick in our order activity and our current realizations remain above pre-pandemic levels. Unit manufacturing costs were comparable to the fourth quarter and raw material costs decreased primarily for OSB web stock. Adjusted EBITDA for distribution was comparable to the fourth quarter as higher volumes and lower operating costs were offset by a decrease in realizations for EWP and commodity products. With that, I'll turn the call over to David to discuss some financial items and our second quarter outlook.",
			"<strong>David M. Wold</strong>",
			"Thank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll be covering key financial items and first quarter financial performance before moving into our second quarter outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16. We ended the quarter with approximately $800 million of cash and cash equivalents and total debt of approximately $5 billion. Our balance sheet, liquidity position and financial flexibility remain exceptionally strong. And we reinforced our flexibility in the first quarter by extending the maturity of our existing $1.5 billion revolving credit facility to 2028. In the first quarter, we generated $126 million of cash from operations. It's worth noting that the first quarter is usually our lowest operating cash flow quarter due to seasonal inventory and other working capital build. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $71 million, which is a typical level for the first quarter. <br/>We returned $139 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend which was increased by 5.6% to $0.19 per share during the quarter. This is in line with our commitment to grow our sustainable base dividend by 5% annually through 2025. During the quarter, we also returned $660 million to shareholders through the payment of our supplemental dividend, which was associated with our 2022 financial results. <br/>We returned $35 million to shareholders through share repurchase activity in the first quarter. These shares were repurchased at an average price of $31.25 and as of quarter end, we have completed nearly $660 million of repurchase under our $1 billion authorization. Looking forward, we will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value. <br/>First quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 15. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment decreased by $6 million compared to the fourth quarter. This decrease was primarily attributable to changes in intersegment profit elimination in LIFO and as well as the absence of nonrecurring health care and workers' compensation items that were benefits in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, key outlook items for the second quarter are presented on Page 18. <br/>In our Timberlands business, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $20 million lower than the first quarter of 2023. Beginning with our Western Timberlands operations, domestic log markets were fairly tensioned at the outset of the second quarter, driven by improved pricing and takeaway of finished products, leaner than normal log inventories and log supply constraints due to persistent winter weather conditions. As the quarter progresses, we expect further improvement in log demand and an increase in log supply as the weather improved seasonally. As a result, our domestic sales realizations are expected to remain fairly stable throughout the second quarter. <br/>That said, we anticipate the quarterly average will be lower compared to the first quarter as log prices have fallen since the beginning of the year. We anticipate our fee harvest volumes will be moderately higher given seasonally favorable operating conditions in the second quarter. Forestry and road costs are expected to be significantly higher as we enter the spring and summer months, and per unit log and haul costs are expected to be significantly lower, partly due to lower fuel prices. <br/>Moving to the export markets, starting with Japan. As Devin mentioned, elevated inventories of European lumber imports and reduced consumption continue to weigh on log demand and pricing. We expect these conditions to persist through the second quarter. As a result, our Japanese sales volumes and realizations are expected to be lower compared to the first quarter. That said, we expect European lumber inventories to normalize as the year progresses, which should increase demand for our logs in the Japanese market. In the meantime, we are shifting a certain amount of logs to our internal mills to capitalize on domestic market conditions. In China, construction activity and log consumption continued to improve following the Lunar New Year and the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions. <br/>That said, log imports from New Zealand have increased significantly following the disruption in the first quarter due to Cyclone activity. This dynamic is likely to put downward pressure on log pricing until excess inventories are cleared. As a result, our sales realizations into China are expected to be slightly lower compared to the first quarter. <br/>We anticipate our sales volumes will be significantly lower as we direct logs to domestic customers to capture higher-margin opportunities. In the South, we expect sawlog markets to remain fairly balanced in the second quarter as log supply improves with drier weather conditions and mills bolster inventories in response to weather-related challenges in the first quarter. Southern fiber markets are expected to soften as a result of end market demand and pricing. Despite improving weather conditions, our fee harvest volumes are expected to be comparable to the first quarter largely driven by a higher mix of fiber logs as thinning activity increases following wet weather conditions earlier in the year. With a higher percentage of fiber logs we expect our sales realizations to be slightly lower compared to the first quarter. <br/>Per unit log and haul costs are expected to decrease slightly as a result of lower fuel prices, and forestry and road costs are expected to increase seasonally. In the north, our sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower than the first quarter and fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly lower as we enter the spring breakup season. Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. <br/>As Devin mentioned, we are still seeing steady demand for our real estate properties, and we continue to expect a consistent flow of HBU transactions with significant premiums to timber value. For the second quarter, we expect earnings will be comparable to and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $20 million lower than the first quarter of 2023 due to the timing and mix of real estate sales. For the full year, we continue to anticipate adjusted EBITDA of approximately $300 million for the segment. For our Wood Products segment, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly higher than the first quarter of 2023, excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB. <br/>Benchmark prices for both lumber and OSB have been fairly stable quarter-to-date, but we are seeing signs of increased demand for wood products as we get further into the spring building season, while channel inventories remain lean. As shown on Page 19, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber are moderately higher than the first quarter average. For OSB, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations are slightly higher than the first quarter average. For our lumber business, we expect higher production and sales volumes in the second quarter and moderately lower unit manufacturing costs as operating rates at our Northwest mills return to a more normalized level, reliability improves across the system and inflationary pressures continue to ease. <br/>Log costs are expected to be moderately lower compared to the first quarter, primarily for Western and Southern logs. For our oriented strand board business, sales volumes are expected to be comparable to the first quarter. We expect slightly lower production volumes and moderately higher unit manufacturing costs due to more planned downtime for annual maintenance in the second quarter. Fiber costs are expected to be slightly lower. <br/>Turning to our Engineered Wood Products business. As Devin mentioned, we have seen an uptick in order activity quarter-to-date, and we expect steady demand as the quarter progresses. As a result, we anticipate significantly higher sales volumes for most products compared to the first quarter. That said, sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower as supply and demand continue to rebalance across the broader EWP market. We anticipate moderately lower raw material costs for most products, including for OSB web stock. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be slightly higher compared to the first quarter due to improved sales volumes. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.",

			"Thanks, David. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. Our view on the housing market is largely unchanged, and we still anticipate a somewhat more challenging backdrop in 2023 and compared to the last couple of years. We've clearly seen some softening from the peak levels of 2022 as home buyer sentiment remains cautious. <br/>That being said, there have been some positive signs lately that the housing market is holding up better than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. Specifically, we've seen improvements in homebuilder sentiment and increase in new home sales and an uptick in single-family starts over the last couple of months. <br/>Additionally, the labor market and household balance sheets are generally in good shape and inventory of existing homes for sale remains well below historical levels. Putting this all together, we continue to believe that underlying housing demand is solid. As we saw in the first quarter, there are buyers willing to step back into the market in response to lower mortgage rates and homebuilder incentives. <br/>Ultimately, we'll need to see further rate reductions, combined with a stable to improving U.S. economy before the housing market fully returns to the levels of the past few years. However, notwithstanding any near-term headwinds, we continue to maintain a positive and constructive longer-term view on housing fundamentals, supported by strong demand, favorable demographic trends and a significantly underbuilt housing stock. <br/>Turning to repair and remodel, where activity remained fairly stable in the first quarter and continued to be supported by steady demand from the professional segment. Demand from the do-it-yourself segment has largely normalized to pre-pandemic levels. Looking forward, we expect customer demand to be bolstered to some degree by prospective homebuyers choosing to remodel in lieu of purchasing a new home in a higher mortgage rate environment. <br/>Lower commodity building product prices may also support repair and remodel activity in the near term. And in any event, we continue to have a bullish longer-term outlook for repair and remodel demand, supported by strong home equity levels and an aging housing stock. In closing, we delivered solid operational and financial performance in the first quarter. We remain as focused as ever on operational excellence and supporting our customers to drive industry-leading margins. <br/>In addition, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we increased our base dividend by 5.6% and returned more than $830 million to shareholders through base and supplemental dividend payments as well as share repurchase activity. Looking forward, we remain constructive on the longer-term demand fundamentals that will drive growth for our business, notwithstanding the current macroeconomic headwinds. Our financial position is exceptionally strong, and we are focused on delivering superior operating performance across our unmatched portfolio of assets as well as enhancing shareholder value through disciplined capital allocation. So with that, I think we can go ahead and open it up for questions.",

			"(Operator Instructions) <br/>Our first question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.",
			"<strong>Anthony James Pettinari</strong>",
			"Devin, as you look at Southern log prices, are you seeing any regional trends worth calling out? And I guess, specifically, over the past few years, the Southern log prices have seen some strength. I think we saw maybe stronger price appreciation in some of these coastal regions versus inland regions. Now that log prices appear to be kind of moderating a bit, I'm wondering, are you seeing those coastal regions holding price better? <br/>Or alternately, are they may be giving up kind of more of the gains that they've had and maybe acting with a little bit more volatility. I don't know if there's any trend that you would call out. I'm just kind of curious what you're seeing and maybe how your portfolio is positioned there.",
			"<strong>Devin W. Stockfish</strong>",
			"Yes, Anthony, good question. As we think about the Southern sawlog pricing dynamic, as you say, there are certainly regional differences. And we've seen that play out over a number of years. As you mentioned, the Atlantic Coast, and we think about that from North Carolina really all the way down through Florida and Georgia, certainly have been a stronger market. I think there are a couple of things at play there. To some extent, the sawlog market is also impacted by the pulpwood markets on the coastal region. As you think about a lot of these mills and where they source logs, if you're if you're next to the ocean, your sourcing radius is only about 180 degrees versus 360. And so that tightens up some of those markets, and I think that bleeds into sawlogs. And certainly, I think that's been one of the drivers of late for why you've seen those prices tick up. <br/>We'll see if with a little softening in the fiber markets, if that wanes a little bit more. But I think more broadly, as you mentioned, we have seen some capacity coming into the south and certainly, that's benefited us in some of the markets where we have large fee holdings, you think Mississippi, Southern Arkansas, some spots in Louisiana. <br/>What we have seen is as new capacity comes into a particular wood basket, we see an uplift on sawlog prices, and we expect that to just continue to be the case as more capacity comes into that region. I think the other thing at play of late has been -- and this is particularly true, I'd say, over the last 18 or so months, there's just been a bit of a constraint on log and haul capacity and I think that's another driver for why you've seen a little bit of an uptick in sawlog prices just as mills wanted to maintain inventory so they didn't lose out on the high lumber price opportunity. <br/>I would say that the haul capacity has probably gotten a little bit better here as we've gotten into 2023. But over the long term, I continue to think you're going to have constraints on both log and haul capacity across the South, just as labor will continue to be an issue. So the net-net is we are seeing regional differences, will we see the Atlantic Coast come down? A little bit more perhaps. But on balance, we still feel pretty optimistic about the trajectory of southern sawlog prices in the years to come.",
			"<strong>Anthony James Pettinari</strong>",
			"Okay. That's super helpful. And then just on Natural Climate Solutions, I don't know if there's any kind of update you can give us in terms of level of interest and engagement and maybe how you're tracking towards that $100 million EBITDA target for '25? Or if there's any kind of specific projects or work streams that you feel like are moving faster or slower than expected?",
			"<strong>Devin W. Stockfish</strong>",
			"Yes. I think the good news is there just continues to be an increasing level of interest across really all parts of that natural climate solutions business. That's true with renewables, solar, wind, a lot of interest and activity there. It's true with mitigation banking. We've seen certainly a lot of interest in carbon capture and storage in the forest carbon market. <br/>So I think we're as optimistic as ever about the trajectory of growth over time with that business. And that's really, like I say, true across every component of that Natural Climate Solutions business. I think the trick continues to be managing the time line to get these projects to fruition. And that's unfortunately the case across each of those different businesses, whether it's the permitting and getting tied into the grid across the renewable section sector or just the time line to get forest carbon projects through the process of a third-party audit and I think that's going to continue to get better over time as more resources go into the system. But it's really a question of timing more than magnitude, but we're really optimistic about the long-term opportunities across really each of those businesses within natural climate solutions.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question is from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets.",
			"<strong>Ketan Mamtora</strong>",
			"Good morning, Devin and David. First question, just related to Anthony's earlier question. Dave any update on the main carbon offset project, how that's coming along? And when do you anticipate kind of sort of incremental information around that?",
			"<strong>Devin W. Stockfish</strong>",
			"Yes. So I feel like we're right at the goal line. We've had all of our materials and responses into the third-party auditor for quite some time. I think one of the things that we've come to appreciate in this space is that there are not enough third-party auditors really to manage the magnitude of carbon credits that are coming to market. I do think that's something that will be resolved over time. <br/>But that's really been the bottleneck for us as we've tried to move that through to the end game. I think we should have something here shortly, and we would anticipate in the very near future, getting those credits issued and then hopefully start selling those forest carbon credits. But I would say also, we've also learned some things through the process that I think should help us scale this program going forward. So more to come on that hopefully in the very near future.",
			"<strong>Ketan Mamtora</strong>",
			"Got it. And Devin, when you say very near future, I would still assume that to be kind of 2023. Is that fair?",
			"<strong>Devin W. Stockfish</strong>",
			"Absolutely.",
			"<strong>Ketan Mamtora</strong>",
			"Got it. And then just switching to capital allocation. I'm curious kind of your approach towards share repurchases, especially in the context of broader capital allocation. In a year like 23, where cash generation will be kind of hit by lower product prices. Obviously, you guys have laid out the base and the supplemental portion. I'm just curious kind of how do you approach share repurchase this year?",
			"<strong>David M. Wold</strong>",
			"Yes, sure. Thanks. I mean we have -- as we've said for a while now, we believe share repurchase is a useful tool in the right circumstances. And certainly, we're fortunate to have a number of capital allocation levers, including M&amp;A, investing in our business and adjustments to our capital structure. So the current share price, share repurchase is an attractive lever. But we're constantly weighing that in light of all the alternatives and the overall backdrop. <br/>And we've been quite active repurchasing shares since we announced our increase to our authority in fall 2021, making our way through about 2/3 of that $1 billion authorization, including about $550 million last year. So as we moved into 2023, the process really remains the same. But to your point, with the cash return framework, the amount of cash committed to be returned to shareholders is going to flex up or down year-to-year based on the amount of adjusted FAD generated. <br/>So in light of the economic environment, we saw to start the year with the relative choppiness in housing. It's important to be disciplined and balanced as we deploy our cash over time, weighing all the market conditions and those available levers and ultimately allocating the cash in the way that creates the most value for shareholders. So in summary, I'd say the evaluation process remains consistent. We'll continue to assess share repurchases along with all the other capital allocation options and report out our activity quarterly.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question is from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs.",
			"<strong>Susan Marie Maklari</strong>",
			"Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Our first question is on the DIY segment of the R&amp;R market. Devin, I know you gave some comments there on the activity that you're seeing. But as we get into the spring, what's the tone from your customers there? And how are you thinking about the spring playing out?",
			"<strong>Devin W. Stockfish</strong>",
			"Yes. On balance, we've seen pretty solid demand. I would say just for context, Q1 is always a little bit softer from the DIY segment just because people aren't doing R&amp;R projects in the Northern regions this time of year. I would say in the South, we've actually seen the activity up a little bit year-over-year as we feed into the big box retailers. <br/>It's been a little lagging in the West, I would say, year-to-date, but that's starting to pick up. So on balance, we're still expecting a very solid year from the DIY segment. I don't think it's going to be at the same levels that we saw during the peak of the pandemic, but certainly very strong relative to pre-pandemic levels.",
			"<strong>Susan Marie Maklari</strong>",
			"Okay. That's helpful. And then looking at the EBITDA margin in lumber and OSB, it was really impressive, given what you're seeing from a pricing perspective. And it does seem like it reflects some of the benefits of the productivity initiatives that you have put in place in the last couple of years. How are you thinking about the production costs going forward, just given the various puts and takes there. And with that, is there any update generally on OpEx 2.0. Any thoughts on how you're progressing against the $175 million, $200 million target for '25?",
			"<strong>Devin W. Stockfish</strong>",
			"Sure. Well, at a high level, I think the benefits of this OpEx program that we've been undertaking for a number of years are really reflected in the Q1 numbers, as you said, in a very challenging market we were still able to deliver positive margins across all of our businesses. And I think just from a relative operating performance standpoint, that's really, really served us well and has been a core part of our operating strategy for quite some time. we are progressing, I think, quite well to that $175 million to $250 million target. And I would say I'm particularly pleased with the progress we made last year. We generated $40 million of OpEx in an environment where we saw historically high levels of inflation. And so that was quite a headwind to navigate through. I think this year, as we see some of the turnover starting to go back to maybe a more normal level and inflation comes down, I feel very good about the tailwinds that we'll have from an OpEx standpoint. <br/>And I think it's just a real testament to the teams that we have all across the organization that are staying focused on improving how we operate every day, trying to innovate everywhere we can and serving our customers to make sure that we're not just maintaining industry level -- industry-leading margins, but we're growing that over time. So really pleased with the efforts there.",
			"<strong>Susan Marie Maklari</strong>",
			"And any thoughts just on those production costs for lumber and OSB as we get into the spring?",
			"<strong>Devin W. Stockfish</strong>",
			"Well, I think as we look across the key cost elements of each of those businesses. The labor piece has remained elevated. I don't think it's increasing at the clip that we've seen over the last several years, but it still remains at an elevated level. But besides labor, I would say, on balance, we are seeing some progress in having that inflationary pressure kind of back off a bit, whether it's fuel, energy, resins, really across the board, we've seen some of the fiber costs come down. So we are seeing some of those inflationary pressures start to wane. And I think that will be a tailwind for us as we get through the year as well.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question is from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson.",
			"<strong>Kurt Willem Yinger</strong>",
			"Good morning, everyone. Wanted to start out on the EWP business. I mean, it's been a really nice source of stability kind of in spite of volatility in commodity markets. Realizations there held in better than we expected. It looks like you're expecting some additional pressure in Q2. But could you talk about how you're thinking about profitability there over the next couple of quarters? And maybe give a little bit more color on what you're seeing on the volume side after maybe some destocking issues the last couple of quarters?",
			"<strong>Devin W. Stockfish</strong>",
			"Well, I think not surprisingly, given that EWP's primary market is single-family construction. We did see softening in EWP demand as we got into Q4 last year, and that really flowed through into Q1. As you say, I think to a large extent, as the housing market softened last fall, the inventory levels across the channel probably built up a little bit more than expected, and we certainly saw in Q1, many of our customers had to work through some existing inventory. And so we adjusted our operating posture down to more -- to be more reflective of the demand environment. <br/>And that, I think, together with just a little bit of softening on the price side is really what you saw reflected in the Q1 EBITDA numbers for EWP. But again, as we step back and look at this business from a high level, we're still at pricing that's well above historical levels, prepandemic levels. And I think as we get deeper into the spring, we've seen our order files start to build. <br/>Certainly, I think what we've seen going on recently with single-family construction in particular, starting to get a little bit more optimistic about how that's going to be playing out in the months to come. So we're going to be increasing our production in Q2, as David mentioned, not -- still not up to the levels that we're running full out, but certainly above where we were in Q4 and Q1. And I think that will continue to trend in the right direction as we get deeper into the year, assuming that housing continues with this momentum. So we feel really good about the business. It's a quality product. We have great service, and I think really a lot of customer loyalty. And so we'll continue to serve our customers and as single-family housing continues to recover, that business will be in really good shape for us going forward.",
			"<strong>Kurt Willem Yinger</strong>",
			"Makes sense. And then just second, on southern log pricing. I guess as you look over the next year, do you think we're kind of in a situation where maybe you see kind of a slow bleed in realizations absent a real inflection in demand? Or from where you sit today, any kind of confidence in the idea that things could really level out in the near term at all?",
			"<strong>Devin W. Stockfish</strong>",
			"I think our view is that it's going to stay fairly stable for most of this year, absent a material change in market dynamics. That's certainly our view from a sawlog perspective I think there's probably a little risk with respect to fiber logs just given end markets in the pulp and paper space has softened a bit. <br/>And so there may be a little softening here until that stabilizes and firms up. But for the sawlog prices, our view is it's going to stay pretty consistent over the course of this year. And then as the market improves overall going forward, a lot of the same drivers for that log price appreciation we've seen over the last couple of years should kick back into gear and we still feel pretty optimistic long term that we'll see that gradual price increase across the sawlog portfolio.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question is from Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.",
			"<strong>Paul C. Quinn</strong>",
			"Yes. Just following up on this real estate energy networks or is it especially the natural climate solutions, looking for the extra color on the carbon project. But where are we at with the -- you signed 2 deals of the carbon storage. Just wondering how that permitting is going for those companies that you're involved with?",
			"<strong>Devin W. Stockfish</strong>",
			"Yes. I think it's progressing as expected. We -- as we said before, there's a fair amount of work to do between signing the deal on actual first injection. You've got to prove out the data, which has been underway and that's progressing well. The permitting and ultimately building out the infrastructure. But I think from a time line standpoint, things are progressing as expected, and we continue to believe we'll see first injection in late 2025 or into 2026. But I think a big part of why we chose those 2 partners is they're both very well equipped to manage through the process and the time line. So we think it's progressing on plan.",
			"<strong>Paul C. Quinn</strong>",
			"Okay. And then just switching over to Wood Products. If I look at 2023, whole year. What are we tracking for lumber volumes? Is this -- last year was down. Are we going to go back to 21 levels and especially on the OSB side as well, it looks like you're tracking at record lows for '23.",
			"<strong>Devin W. Stockfish</strong>",
			"Yes. For lumber, we'll definitely be up year-over-year. Sitting here today, it's probably kind of a mid-single digit, high single-digit percentage-wise improvement year-over-year. And remember, last year, there were some things going on around, the strike in the Pacific Northwest. And frankly, with some of the labor issues, probably the production was down as a result of that to some degree as well. So we should see that improve in 2023? And then from an OSB standpoint, that should be up slightly as well.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question is from Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research Partners.",
			"<strong>Mark Adam Weintraub</strong>",
			"Real quick on the OSB pricing. You show current up $5 versus the 1Q average. And by my math, when I look at the random length pricing, it's something like $450 million. And is that just because what you're showing is really where prices were 3 or 4 weeks ago given your order files? Or is there something else that might be going on that would depress the type of uptick you would expect to see in OSB pricing?",
			"<strong>Devin W. Stockfish</strong>",
			"No, you hit on it exactly, Mark. It's just a function of when you have a 3- to 5-week order file, it takes time for the current prices that are reflected in random lengths to flow through to realization. So there's a lag on the way up. But then there's also a lag on the way down. So it nets out to be the same. It's just a timing issue.",
			"<strong>Mark Adam Weintraub</strong>",
			"Got it. Okay. And then on the question on the U.S. South, a couple of questions on the timber markets. and where they may be going. Of course, you don't just grow trees, you also consume logs and making lumber. So I was hoping to get a sense as to what your net position on sawlogs might be? And if there's a difference regionally if you're more long in the Carolinas or the Atlantic Coast versus in some of the Mississippi Arkansas, Louisiana basket, that would be super helpful.",
			"<strong>Devin W. Stockfish</strong>",
			"Yes. That's a really good question, Mark. I think from our standpoint, we have 7 million acres across really all of the major markets across the South unparalleled diversification. I think generally speaking, we have peer-leading scale in every market. So I think as we move forward in a world where we think sawlogs are going up, I think we're really well position going forward. And as you know, there's just been a lot of new capacity coming into the south. <br/>And I think -- and we've seen this in markets where new capacities come in, that's pushed up sawlog prices. So as we think about how does that impact our business as a whole going forward. I think it's positive. First, on the timberland side, we are a net seller of logs. So on balance, we generally sell between 40% to 50% of our grade fee logs in the south to our internal mills. So that means the remainder of those logs go to third-party customers. So higher sawlog prices in the South will have a net benefit to Weyerhaeuser on those third-party logs. <br/>Now obviously, higher log prices also have an impact on wood products manufacturing as that's a key input cost. But I think, again, the integrated model that we have is going to help us in that respect. So the manufacturing side is those sawlog price increase over time. Those logistics and efficiency benefits that our manufacturing operations enjoy today on the fee timber that we supply is going to become even more important in maintaining industry-leading margins. And you can just look to the Pacific Northwest for an example of that. <br/>So I think on balance, we feel very good about that. Obviously, there are regional differences, but I would say outside of the Southeast, we have manufacturing operations in every other wood basket. So most of those dynamics will play out very similarly. And I think all in, if you want to look at log prices and where they're going, I think with our business to scale the integrated nature, we're going to be the premier investment vehicle to leverage increasing Southern sawlog prices into the future.",
			"<strong>Mark Adam Weintraub</strong>",
			"Okay. That's super helpful. Just one follow-up. You mentioned that you use about 40%, 50% of your logs go to your own mills. Do you buy much from the outside for your sawmills?",
			"<strong>Devin W. Stockfish</strong>",
			"We do. So generally speaking, our internal mills are going to get 50% of their logs from our fee timber and then they will buy the remaining 50% from third parties.",
			"<strong>Mark Adam Weintraub</strong>",
			"Okay. So you're kind of moderately net long. Is that a fair if I just do that -- if I do the math in my head, it would suggest you're moderately net long sawtimber in the U.S. South. Is that fair?",
			"<strong>Devin W. Stockfish</strong>",
			"Correct.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question is from Buck Horne with Raymond James.",
			"<strong>Buck Horne</strong>",
			"Quick question on the lumber markets and just kind of one of the wildcards that's kind of probably affected prices this year. I'm just wondering if you could help us characterize, what's happening with the European wood imports that either hit domestically and/or impacting international markets? Do you see a peak of some of that European wood out there? Or how long will it take to work through some of that inventory that's hitting the domestic market?",
			"<strong>Devin W. Stockfish</strong>",
			"We certainly have seen an uptick in particularly the European lumber hitting the U.S. market, and I'll speak to Japan here in just a moment as well. I think that's a function really of a couple of different things. First, if you look back over the last couple of years, clearly, the lumber pricing dynamic in the U.S. made it a very attractive place to send wood. And so even overcoming the logistics and transportation costs, it was a margin positive move to get lumber from Europe into the U.S. market. <br/>Even as lumber prices have come down in the U.S., I think, to some extent, it's still probably the best margin opportunity for some lumber because the European demand has really come down with all of the dynamics that are going on there. And so I think you're going to see European imports come down a little bit in 2023, probably not dramatically, however, until you start to see the European Economy and European demand pick up. <br/>We did see in Japan, a pretty significant slug of lumber hitting that market at the end of 2022. And as David mentioned, that has put a little bit of pressure on the Japanese market for our customers and our log deliveries. We have started to see the European volume coming into Japan, Wayne. And so we expect that excess inventory of European lumber to work down here in the second quarter, and we should be back into a more normalized position as we get into the third quarter. I think over the long term, though, but the reality is with the beetle infestation issue that they've had in Central Europe, that volume is rapidly becoming less viable. <br/>I think as the Russian imports of lumber into Europe assuming that those don't come back in a material way in the near future. The overall dynamic is going to be the Europeans will have to keep more lumber in Europe in a normalized circumstance. And so I think this is a short-term issue that will resolve itself in the not-too-distant future.",
			"<strong>Buck Horne</strong>",
			"Very helpful color. I appreciate that. And then shifting to -- you mentioned capacity that's come into the U.S. South in terms of mill production. Can you help us maybe characterize in terms of like how quickly some of that capacity is coming online in the U.S. South. Is that -- is the growth rate that you're seeing faster? And are we bringing in more lumber capacity in the U.S. South than where I guess, replacing that's being curtailed in Canada? Or how do you see that dynamic in terms of what's being added domestically versus what's coming out of Canada?",
			"<strong>Devin W. Stockfish</strong>",
			"Yes, there's certainly been a lot of new capacity coming into the South, but we've also seen a lot of capacity coming out of BC. I suspect there will be more to come. If you just step back and look at the overall amount of new lumber capacity into the U.S., it's really not a significant amount over the last several years. And we're continuing to see new mills come in and new announcements, although that's probably slowed just a little bit over the last 6 to 9 months because of what's going on in the broader economy. <br/>But I think a good way to think about it is you're going to see 1 billion, 1.5 billion board feet coming into the South, more or less every year for the next little bit. But I think you're going to see a comparable amount come out of British Columbia, just given what's going on and the dynamic there. So net North American lumber additions, I'm not sure it's going to be all that much really.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question is from George Staphos with Bank of America.",
			"<strong>George Leon Staphos</strong>",
			"Just a couple of quick questions here. Number one, Devin, David, can you remind us or call out what the headwind factors, the strikes to whether, what that might have taken away from fourth quarter and perhaps aided operations, specifically in Wood Products during the first quarter. And similarly, were there any things that specifically or particularly went well for you on operations within the Wood segment during the first quarter because performance there was well ahead of our forecast even with the decline in realization. <br/>Second question I had; all my other ones have pretty much been asked. Can you remind us what you're seeing in terms of log inventories in China at the ports? I seem to remember that inventories remain pretty elevated. But the outlook seems to be relatively stable to constructive from your vantage point. So I just want to see what the interplay is between inventories at the ports and what you're seeing.",
			"<strong>Devin W. Stockfish</strong>",
			"Yes, George. So maybe I'll take China first and then comment briefly on the lumber piece. From a China standpoint, the latest published numbers from an inventory standpoint in China were down. However, what we saw on the ground in April is a number of ships that were coming over from New Zealand with wood that had been delayed post cyclone. And so I think the inventories in the next published number are going to be up a bit. And I think we've also seen some very low-quality European logs in that market that they're trying to get rid of more or less at fire sale prices. And so I think here, in the very near term, it's just going to be a little bit softer environment as they work through some of that inventory. <br/>That being said, the takeaway has really started to pick up here as we've come out of the Lunar New Year. I think as we get out past this period of working through some of this inventory that support at the moment, we're feeling pretty good about the back half of the year in China, and I think that will be a nice flex opportunity for us out of the Pacific Northwest. <br/>On the lumber side, and David may have the specific numbers in terms of the Q4 impact. But I would say beyond the strike impact, the one thing I would point out is just as we get into an environment where, as I mentioned earlier, turnover is starting to lessen a little bit more stability. We've got the transportation networks that are starting to get a little bit more, I would say, healthy. And so, on balance, the business just ran better overall in Q1. And I think that's really, again, a testament to the work that our teams are doing and what's still a relatively challenging environment.",
			"<strong>David M. Wold</strong>",
			"Yes, George, I'd just call out the impact in Q4 would have been pretty negligible based on where margins were at that point in time of the work stoppage. I mean we had a marginal amount of costs associated that may have offset those marginal piece of additional income there. So not really much there. I'd just call out just another great example of the work we've done over time on our cost structure and the OpEx performance of the team to deliver a great quarter in challenging market conditions.",
			"<strong>George Leon Staphos</strong>",
			"So Dave, on a going-forward basis, obviously, there's going to be seasonality. But if we hold pricing constant, this is pretty much a good baseline for operations and for our own margin forecast on a going-forward basis. Would that be fair?",
			"<strong>David M. Wold</strong>",
			"Yes, I'd say so. As Devin referenced earlier, we've seen some easing on the inflationary side with the labor piece still kind of being persistently strong, but across the board in terms of the other costs, we're seeing some nice signs of easing there.

			"<strong>Weyerhaeuser Company</strong> WY reported mixed first-quarter 2023 results, wherein its earnings handily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but net sales missed the same marginally.<br/><br/>On a year-over-year basis, the top and bottom lines declined. The quarter’s performance reflects strong execution across the businesses, offset by macroeconomic headwinds, supply chain disruptions and dynamic market conditions.<br/><br/>WY’s shares inched up 0.2% in the after-hours trading session on Apr 27, after the earnings release. Notably, the world's leading private owner of timberlands increased its base dividend by 5.6% to 19 cents per share (76 cents annually) from 18 cents (72 cents).<br/><br/>Devin W. Stockfish, president and chief executive officer of Weyerhaeuser, said, “Looking forward, we remain constructive on the longer-term demand fundamentals that will drive growth for our businesses, notwithstanding the current macroeconomic headwinds. Our financial position is exceptionally strong and we remain focused on driving operational excellence across our unmatched portfolio of assets and enhancing shareholder value through disciplined capital allocation.\"",
			"The company reported adjusted earnings of 21 cents per share, beating the consensus mark of 12 cents by 75% but decreasing 84% from the year-ago reported figure of $1.31 cents.<br/><br/>Net sales for the quarter came in at $1.88 billion, missing the consensus mark of $1.895 billion by 0.7% and declining 39.6% from the $3.11 billion reported in the prior-year quarter.<br/><br/>Adjusted EBITDA came in at $395 million, significantly down from $1,497 million in the year-ago period.",
			"<strong>Timberlands</strong>: Net sales (including inter-segment sales of $142 million) from the segment came in at $604 million, down from the year-ago figure of $626 million. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $188 million, down from $247 million in the year-ago quarter.<br/><br/><strong>Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources</strong>: For the reported quarter, the segment’s net sales amounted to $101 million, down from $128 million a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $89 million, reflecting a decline from $116 million reported in the year-ago level.<br/><br/><strong>Wood Products</strong>: For the first quarter, segment sales totaled $1,318 million, down from $2,519 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $148 million, significantly down from $1,233 million a year ago.",
			"As of Mar 31, 2023, Weyerhaeuser had cash and cash equivalents of $797 million, down from $1.88 billion at 2022-end and $1.2 billion at March 2022-end. Long-term debt was $4.07 billion at quarter-end, in line with 2022-end and down from $5.05 billion at March 2022-end.<br/><br/>Net cash from operations was $126 million for first-quarter and $957 million in the respective year-ago period.",
			"For the Timberland segment, the company expects earnings (before special items) and adjusted EBITDA to be $20 million low sequentially. In the West, it anticipates moderately lower sales realizations, partially offset by significantly low per-unit log and haul costs as well as slightly high fee harvest volumes. In the South, sales realizations and per-unit log and haul costs are likely to be slightly low, while fee harvest volumes are projected to be comparable. Forestry and road costs in the South and North are expected to be seasonally higher.<br/><br/>In the Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment, Weyerhaeuser expects earnings to be sequentially comparable. Adjusted EBITDA is likely to be $20 million lower than first-quarter, thanks to the timing and mix of sales.<br/><br/>Within the Wood Products segment, the company predicts earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be moderately higher, sequentially (excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board or OSB). WY anticipates comparable sales volumes, slightly lower fiber costs and moderately higher unit manufacturing costs for OSB. Sales volumes are likely to be significantly higher and raw material costs are projected to be moderately low for most engineered wood products, partially offset by slightly lower sales.",
			"Currently, WY carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).<br/><br/>You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.<br/><br/><strong>Otis Worldwide Corporation </strong>OTIS started 2023 on a solid note. The company’s first-quarter 2023 earnings and sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Its quarterly results reflected 10th consecutive quarters of organic sales growth, along with solid Service performance, contributing to mid-single digit adjusted earnings per share growth.<br/><br/>Otis remains focused on strong portfolio growth and generating a solid New Equipment backlog. It also intends to expand operating margins, return cash to shareholders through a capital-allocation strategy and pursue additional progress toward ESG goals.<br/><br/><strong>United Rentals, Inc.</strong> URI reported first-quarter 2023 results. Its earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but revenues beat the same. Nonetheless, on a year-over-year basis, earnings and revenues increased, courtesy of sustained demand in its end markets and the strength of its core rental business.<br/><br/>URI also reaffirmed its 2023 guidance, given broad-based end-market activity, contractor backlogs, customer sentiment and solid visibility. Also, it unveiled a quarterly dividend of $1.48 per share with an annualized yield of approximately 0.4%. The company also repurchased $250 million of stock under its existing $1.25 billion share repurchase program.<br/><br/><strong>Masco Corporation</strong> MAS reported better-than-expected results for first-quarter 2023. The top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company has been benefiting from strong pricing actions and operational improvements.<br/><br/>On the other hand, MAS’ adjusted earnings and net sales declined on a year-over-year basis due to supply-chain challenges and inflation headwinds.",

			"Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.",
			"While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.",
			"<b>Alexandria Real Estate Equities in Focus</b>",
			"Based in Pasadena, Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -15.76%. The life science real estate company is paying out a dividend of $1.21 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.94% compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.59% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.73%.",
			"Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $4.84 is up 2.5% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Alexandria Real Estate Equities has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 5.84%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Alexandria Real Estate Equities's current payout ratio is 57%. This means it paid out 57% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.",
			"ARE is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $8.95 per share, with earnings expected to increase 6.29% from the year ago period.",
			"<b>Bottom Line</b>",
			"From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.",
			"For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, ARE is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).",

			"The CoStar Commercial Repeat-Sale Indices (CCRSI) are the most comprehensive and accurate measures of commercial real estate prices in the United States. In addition to the national Composite Index (presented in both equal-weighted and value-weighted versions), national Investment-Grade Index, and national General Commercial Index, which are reported monthly, 30 sub-indices in the CoStar index family are reported quarterly. The sub-indices include breakdowns by property sector (office, industrial, retail, multifamily, hospitality, and land), by region of the country (Northeast, South, Midwest, and West), by transaction size and quality (general commercial, investment-grade), and by market size (composite index of the prime market areas in the country).",
			"The CoStar indices are constructed using a repeat sales methodology, widely considered the most accurate measure of price changes for real estate. This methodology measures the movement in the prices of commercial properties by collecting data on actual transaction prices. When a property is sold more than once, a sales pair is created. The prices from the first and second sales are then used to calculate price movement for the property. The aggregated price changes from all the sales pairs are used to create a price index. Historical price indices are revised as additional repeat transactions are recorded.",

			"<strong>Simon Property Group</strong>’s SPG first-quarter 2023 results are scheduled to be released on May 2, after the closing bell. The company’s quarterly results are likely to exhibit year-over-year growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.<br/><br/>This Indianapolis, IN-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) reported fourth-quarter 2022 comparable FFO per share of $3.15, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a whisker. This performance was backed by a better-than-expected top line. Results reflected a healthy operating performance and growth in occupancy levels.<br/><br/>In the last four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on each occasion, the average surprise being 1.31%. This is depicted in the graph below:",

			"Per a report from <strong>CBRE Group</strong> CBRE, the United States retail real estate market remained resilient in first-quarter 2023, with the retail availability rate falling 50 basis points (bps) year over year to a new low of 4.8%.<br/><br/>The core retail sales climbed 50 bps to 7.7% from the prior quarter. The non-store retail sales of 9.8%, although falling 120 bps from the previous period, remained above core retail sales for the third consecutive quarter.<br/><br/>The EA asking rent for the first quarter was $22.97. Also, overall retail rent growth of 2% year over year remained above the 10-year average.<br/><br/>Retail space absorption was at 8.6 million square feet for first-quarter 2023, marking the 10th consecutive quarter of positive retail absorption per the CBRE Group report.<br/><br/>Simon Property’s portfolio of premium assets in the United States and abroad is anticipated to have benefited from the above-mentioned factors.<br/><br/>Amid growing consumers’ preference for in-person shopping experiences following the pandemic downtime, demand for SPG’s properties is likely to have remained healthy, aiding occupancy levels and leasing activity in the quarter.  <br/><br/>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter lease income is pegged at $1.24 billion, up from $1.21 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for management fees and other revenues is $28.8 million, up 4.3% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. In addition, the consensus estimate for quarterly revenues is presently pegged at $1.34 billion, indicating an increase of 3.1% year over year.<br/><br/>Simon Property’s adoption of an omni-channel strategy and successful tie-ups with premium retailers are likely to have paid off well.<br/><br/>Moreover, its efforts to explore the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years, is anticipated to have enabled it to tap the growth opportunities in areas where people prefer to live, work and play.<br/><br/>This March, Simon Property announced that it would collaborate with José Andrés Group to bring award-winning restaurants to several of the company’s premier properties. The move is likely to draw more shoppers to its shopping centers, making it a strategic fit.<br/><br/>Further, in the same month, SPG’s majority-owned operating partnership subsidiary, Simon Property Group, L.P., closed a new $5 billion multi-currency unsecured revolving credit facility, replacing the existing $4 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility. This enhanced the company’s liquidity position and financial flexibility.<br/><br/>We expect the company’s robust balance sheet position to have supported its strategic expansions during the quarter to be reported.<br/><br/>However, the economic slowdown amid macroeconomic uncertainty and higher e-commerce adoption might have cast a pall on SPG’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.<br/><br/>Also, rising interest rates might have raised expenses in the to-be-reported quarter.<br/> <br/>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share has been revised marginally downward over the past month to $2.80. Nonetheless, the figure indicates a slight increase from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. ",
			"Our proven model predicts a surprise in terms of FFO per share for SPG this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — increases the odds of a beat.

			"Toxic stocks may prove to be a threat to the performance of a portfolio. Such stocks may appear lucrative at first but turn out to be risky as one digs deeper. The risk of owning toxic stocks can be eliminated if investors remain vigilant about the performance of every stock that they own in their portfolio.<br/><br/>The performance of a stock mainly depends on the underlying strength of the company, which, in turn, is dependent on financial flexibility, legal standing and management’s decisions. Most companies issue debt to raise money to grow their businesses. But the problem begins when those companies are unable to generate enough profits to pay off their liabilities. Stock prices of such insolvent companies get wiped out within a few days or even within a few hours.<br/><br/>Such companies can be identified by careful examination of their financial statements, which reflect the financial position of the company. If the intrinsic value of the company appears lower than its stock price, the stock becomes overvalued and is prone to losing its value over time. This is when investors should consider discarding the stock.<br/><br/>The stock price of a company also depends on management’s decision and legal challenges associated with the company. If management is inexperienced or has a track record of making poor decisions, the company’s future and ultimately the performance of the stock are bound to go downhill. Investors can prevent themselves from such risks by keeping abreast of latest news on the company.<br/><br/>Diversification offers an opportunity to avoid the magnitude of losses associated with the risk of owning toxic stocks. Through diversification, one can invest in different stocks from different asset classes to limit their exposure to a particular stock.<br/><br/>The detection and removal of a toxic stock at the correct time is crucial to overall portfolio health. If investors can accurately determine toxic stocks, they can take advantage of short selling, which is the process of selling stock at higher prices and buying them back at lower prices.<br/><br/><strong>Dutch Bros Inc.</strong> BROS, <strong>UBS Group AG</strong> UBS, <strong>CoStar Group, Inc.</strong> CSGP and <strong>Semtech Corporation</strong> SMTC are a few toxic stocks that you should dump from your portfolio.",
			"Here is a winning strategy that will help you to identify toxic stocks:<br/><br/><strong>Most recent Debt/Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average</strong>: High debt/equity ratio implies high leverage. High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount.<br/><br/><strong>P/E using a 12-month forward EPS estimate greater than 50</strong>: A very high forward P/E implies that a stock is highly overvalued.<br/><br/><strong>% Change in F (1) and F (2) Estimate (12 Weeks) less than -5</strong>: Negative EPS estimate revision for this fiscal year and the next during the past 12 weeks points to analysts’ pessimism.<br/><br/><strong>Zacks Rank more than #3 (Hold)</strong>: We have not considered Buy/Hold-rated stocks that generally outperform or are in line with the market. You can see <strong>the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.<br/><br/>Here are four of the 25 toxic stocks that showed up on the screen:<br/><br/><strong>Dutch Bros</strong> is an operator and franchisor of drive-thru shops, which focus on serving high-quality, hand-crafted beverages with unparalleled speed and superior services. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BROS’s 2023 bottom line is pegged at a profit of 20 cents per share. The consensus mark has moved south from earnings of 36 cents per share to earnings of 20 cents per share over the past 90 days. Dutch Bros missed earnings estimates in two out of the last four quarters and beat once, with the average negative surprise being 11.9%. The company carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and has a VGM Score of D.<br/><br/><strong>UBS</strong> is a bank and the core operating company of the UBS Group.

UBS beat earnings estimates in two out of the four trailing quarters and missed twice, with the average surprise being 2.09%.

However, rising rental property operating expenses acted as a dampener. DLR maintained its guidance for 2023 core FFO per share but lowered its expectations for full-year revenues.<br/><br/>The company registered operating revenues of $1.34 billion in the first quarter, increasing 18.8% year over year. However, the same missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.73%.

			"<strong>Thomas W. Toomey</strong>",
			"Thank you, Trent, and welcome to UDR's First Quarter 2023 Conference Call. Presenting on the call with me today are President and Chief Financial Officer, Joe Fisher; and Senior Vice President of Operations, Mike Lacy, who will discuss our results. Senior officers Andrew Cantor and Chris van Ens will also be available during the Q&amp;A portion of the call.<br/>To begin, we started 2023 from a position of strength: steady demand from years of housing undersupply in the U.S., cycle-best relative affordability versus alternative housing options and embedded same-store revenue growth that was 3x higher than our historical average. <br/>Year-to-date results demonstrate this strength. Let me highlight those. One, our first quarter same-store revenue growth of nearly 10% and same-store NOI growth of almost 12% led to year-over-year FFOA per share growth of 9%; two, early second quarter trends across traffic, blended rate growth and collections are in line with our expectations, reinforcing the confidence we have in our business and guidance; and three, our balance sheet is strong, and we continue to adhere to capital market signals with our capital-light strategy. Our investment-grade balance sheet and nearly $1 billion of liquidity provide safety during the potential downturn and afford the opportunity to grow the company should our cost of capital improve.<br/>Looking ahead, there remains a wide variety of economic scenarios that could play out, but UDR has excelled across a variety of environments over our 50-year history. Our strategy is built around diversification, prudent capital allocation decisions and focusing on what we control to drive relative outperformance within the industry. These include: first, our leading operating platform continues to maximize the value of our communities and deliver a high level of resident satisfaction; second, innovation initiatives are, again, proving to be a differentiator versus peers and are a positive contributor to our growth profile in 2023 and beyond; and third, our diversified portfolio provides both safety and the ability to allocate capital across a variety of markets and investment opportunities that generate high risk-adjusted returns.<br/>Additionally, we benefit from favorable relative setups for the U.S. multifamily industry. Job and income growth have defied expectations and remain positive. Total housing supply is stable, and the level of future development starts has started to decline. And relative affordability versus single-family housing is as favorable as it's been in nearly my 22-year tenure at UDR.<br/>Taken together, I remain very optimistic on the relative strength of the multifamily industry and UDR's advantages within the industry. We have a strong culture, a talented team with a robust track record of performance, and we continue to invest in our associates and additional technologies. We expect to improve our efficiency, expand our NOI margin and create value for all UDR shareholders and stakeholders.<br/>In closing, I thank my fellow associates for your commitment to excellence and innovation, which I'm confident should continue to drive attractive, absolute and relative results. <br/>With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.",
			"<strong>Michael D. Lacy</strong>",
			"Thanks, Tom. The topics I will cover today include: our first quarter same-store results, early second quarter 2023 trends and how they factor into our reaffirmed full year 2023 same-store growth outlook and an update on our continued innovation and operating efficiencies. <br/>To begin, strong year-over-year same-store revenue and NOI growth of 9.6% and 11.7% in the first quarter were driven by: first, blended lease rate growth of 3.5%, which was in line with our expectations and driven by above-average renewal rate growth of 7.4%; second, occupancy that held strong at 96.6% supported by healthy traffic; and third, rent collections continued to improve, with March being our highest level of in-the-month collections since the beginning of COVID.<br/>During the quarter, we remain focused on enhancing our rent roll and recapturing apartment homes that were previously occupied by long-term delinquent residents. The short-term effect of our approach had 3 direct results: one, approximately 400 basis points of higher annualized turnover versus the prior year, although 39% annualized turnover is in line with our long-term first quarter average; two, increased repair and maintenance expenses; and three, higher levels of availability during a seasonally slow leasing period and, therefore, a near-term drag on pricing.<br/>However, re-leasing these apartment homes to paying residents is beneficial to total revenue. Our efforts to date have reduced the number of long-term delinquent residents to approximately 300 or 50 basis points of total units, which is down from a peak of 750 and compares to our long-term average of 250. This, in combination with better in-month collections, helped to further reduce our bad debt reserve.<br/>Next, we continue to see favorable fundamental trends to start the second quarter. First, demand remains relatively healthy. Year-to-date job growth has been stronger than many had anticipated, and traffic is roughly in line with the elevated levels we saw a year ago and well above the long-term average. <br/>Second, the financial health of our residents appear to be in good shape as wage inflation has largely kept pace with rent growth, resulting in steady rent income levels in the low 20% range. In light of recent consumer spending habits and bank commentary, we continue to watch for signs of change, but affordability remains strong as only 10% of our first quarter move-outs were due to rent increases, which is down from roughly 18% at its peak during the middle of 2022. Furthermore, we have yet to see material evidence of residents choosing to double-up.<br/>Third, relative affordability remains in our favor. Renting an apartment is approximately 50% less expensive than owning a home versus 35% less expensive pre-COVID. Only 5% of move-outs in the first quarter were due to home purchase, which is roughly 60% less than our historical average. <br/>And last, concessions remain minimal and average approximately half a week on new leases across our portfolio. The concessions we have been offering remain primarily concentrated in certain submarkets of San Francisco, Washington, D.C. and our Sunbelt markets, with the latter a function of new supply being delivered to those areas.<br/>With this backdrop, second quarter blended lease rate growth is trending as expected and should average approximately 3%. New lease rate growth in April is approximately 50 basis points higher than March, though renewal rate has decelerated by 100 basis points. This convergence is in line with our expectations. <br/>Relating this to full year 2023 guidance, to achieve the 6.75% midpoint of our year-over-year same-store revenue growth guidance, full year blended rate growth needs to approximate 2.5%. With first quarter blended rate growth of 3.5%, we need to average only 2% blends for the duration of the year. We believe blends are anchored by renewal rate growth which, even during past downturns, was at least 2% on trailing 4-quarter average. In short, we remain confident in our ability to achieve the guidance we set in February.<br/>Turning to regional trends. On our last call, we anticipated that growth in our Sunbelt markets would continue to converge with the Coast and that Coast would have better growth results starting in mid-2023. That crossover occurred in the first quarter, slightly ahead of our expectation. While traffic remains healthy across all of our markets, the level of new supply being delivered to certain Sunbelt markets has resulted in higher market level concessions and has led to a pause in the ability to push new lease rate growth.<br/>Conversely, results and momentum in New York and Boston, which comprise roughly 18% of our same-store NOI, have been stronger than expected. Minimal levels of new supply and robust traffic led to 97% occupancy and portfolio-leading blended lease rate growth of more than 6% on average for these 2 markets in the first quarter. These divergent situations reinforce the value of a diversified portfolio across markets and price points. We will continue to take a balanced approach between rate and occupancy to maximize revenue and NOI.<br/>Finally, we are progressing with our various innovation initiatives, which will add to our bottom line in 2023 and beyond. Our high-margin, revenue-focused and tech-enabling building-wide WiFi project is expected to be rolled out across approximately 1/3 of our portfolio by year-end and our entire portfolio by 2025. We are making inroads on various resident-specific initiatives as part of our customer experience project that will enhance satisfaction, reduce resident turnover and drive greater pricing power.<br/>And we have advanced the integration of big data to enhance our pricing system. Over the past decade, our same-store growth results have benefited from approximately 50 basis point contribution from our unique initiatives. In this year, we expect the same. <br/>In closing, thanks to our teams for your passion in delivering best-in-class results to our residents and stakeholders. I'll now turn over the call to Joe.",
			"<strong>Joseph D. Fisher</strong>",
			"Thank you, Mike. The topics I will cover today include our first quarter results, a summary of recent transactions and capital markets activity and the balance sheet and liquidity update. .<br/>Our first quarter FFO as adjusted per share of $0.60 achieved the midpoint of our previously provided guidance range and was supported by strong year-over-year same-store NOI growth. The slight sequential decline was driven by higher average share count from the settlement of forward equity agreements at the end of the fourth quarter and higher interest expense, partially offset by incremental NOI from recently completed development communities.<br/>Included in our first quarter results was a $3.7 million onetime expense benefit due to a refundable payroll tax credit related to the employee retention credit program, which was previously contemplated in our original guidance expectations. <br/>Looking ahead, our second quarter FFOA per share guidance range is $0.60 to $0.62 or an approximately 7% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. The 2% sequential increase is driven by a combination of higher NOI from same-store, joint venture and recently developed communities. Year-to-date, results are in line with our initial expectations, and we have reaffirmed our full year 2023 same-store growth and FFOA per share guidance ranges.<br/>Next, a transactions and capital markets update. First, in alignment with our shift towards a capital-light strategy in mid-2022, we made no acquisitions, no new DCP investments and no new development starts during the first quarter. <br/>Second, during the quarter, we completed construction of a $145 million 300-apartment home community in Washington, D.C. With this, our current development pipeline consists of just 2 communities totaling 415 homes at a budgeted cost of $188 million, with 40% of this cost already incurred, thereby limiting our forward funding commitments. <br/>And third, during the quarter, we achieved stabilization on 2 development communities totaling 605 apartment homes for a cost of $142 million at a blended stabilized yield of approximately 7%. We also continued the successful lease-up at our 3 other recently completed development communities, which have an expected weighted average stabilized yield in the high 5s.<br/>Finally, our investment-grade balance sheet remains liquid and fully capable of funding our capital needs. Some highlights include: first, we have only $113 million of consolidated debt or approximately 0.5% of enterprise value scheduled to mature through 2024 after excluding amounts on our credit facilities and our commercial paper program. Our proactive approach to managing our balance sheet has resulted in the best 3-year liquidity outlook in the sector and the lowest weighted average interest rate amongst the multifamily peer group at 3.25%. Second, we have nearly $1 billion of liquidity as of March 31. And third, our leverage metrics remain strong. Debt to enterprise value was just 29% at quarter end, while net debt to EBITDAre was 5.7x, down nearly a full turn from 6.4x a year ago and 0.5 turn better versus pre-COVID levels. We expect these metrics to improve further throughout 2023.<br/>In all, our balance sheet remains in excellent shape. Our liquidity position is strong. We remain selective in our capital deployment with balanced forward sources and uses, and we continue to utilize a variety of capital allocation competitive advantages to drive earnings accretion. <br/>With that, I will open it up for Q&amp;A. Operator?",

			"(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Eric Wolfe with Citi.",
			"<strong>Eric Jon Wolfe</strong>",
			"We get a lot of questions from investors on sort of how supply is going to impact the Sunbelt later this year, just that there's more sort of cumulative impact from all the supply delivering. I guess as you look at your markets and project forward, do you see the Sunbelt diverging from the coastal markets later this year? Or do you think things will just keep trending together?",
			"<strong>Joseph D. Fisher</strong>",
			"Eric, it's Joe. Maybe I'll kick it off and then kick it over to Mike to talk about some of the trends we're seeing down there. But we've talked about seeing a pretty decent increase in supply as it comes to the Sunbelt. I do think our portfolio is a little bit more insulated when you look at supply growth within our submarkets. We have a little bit more of a B quality and suburban price point down there, so a little bit more insulation. But overall, I think Sunbelt for us has seen about 3.5% of stock. And so while demand has held up relatively well in recent years, depending on the macro outlook, if that does start to fade a little bit, you probably have a little bit more risk there as supply comes on. So Mike can probably give you a little bit more on what we're seeing down there.",
			"<strong>Michael D. Lacy</strong>",
			"Yes. Thanks, Joe. Eric, specific to current trends I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are seeing concessions start to pick up a little bit in the Sunbelt. That being said, we're not offering much there. Occupancy is still strong in that 96.5% range, and we expect that we'll be able to continue to push rents as traffic continues to increase on a month-over-month basis moving into the season.",
			"<strong>Eric Jon Wolfe</strong>",
			"That's helpful. And then unrelated question, but you're always thought of as being forward thinking on the technology front. And to that end, I was just wondering if you'd consider using your platform to help manage the back office of other companies' portfolios like one of your peers announced recently.",
			"<strong>Joseph D. Fisher</strong>",
			"Eric, it's Joe. It's a good question, a good thought. But I'd say when you look at our innovation, we've talked a lot about the 60-plus initiatives that we have out there right now that we're focused on, $40-plus million that we think will come in at a run rate here in the next couple of years. So for us, I think staying focused on what we can control, what's going to benefit the consolidated portfolio today and keep rolling out those initiatives, I think we want to stay laser-focused on that for the time being.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Next question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America.",
			"<strong>Jeffrey Alan Spector</strong>",
			"Just taking a step back, again, it's pretty amazing, the quarter you've had. We've been talking about this recession coming for over a year now and then just some of your comments on latest conditions and the health of the tenant. I guess from your seat on this recession, how are you thinking about this, just big picture? And is it possible that apartments or UDR's portfolio could be more resilient than what we've seen in the past during recessions? In particular, we're seeing a lot of white-collar job layoffs.",
			"<strong>Thomas W. Toomey</strong>",
			"Yes, Jeff, this is Toomey. With respect to a recession, I mean, I think they're all different shapes, forms, and how you get out of them are quite a puzzle to solve through history. But this one strikes me as a capital markets recession brought on by policy, lending patterns, capital flows. And so that's kind of unusual. Usually, it's followed by a rapid employment outlook change. And we're just not seeing it. And you've seen the first 3 months of the year, probably 4, all have positive job growth, which is a big driver of our business. So it feels like, to us, capital markets recession not impacting the jobs that severely. And if it does, it's going to be localized and we'll adjust accordingly. But it doesn't feel like the normal type of recession that has a heavy employment-based downturn.",
			"<strong>Jeffrey Alan Spector</strong>",
			"And then if I can ask, and I apologize if I missed this, did you discuss how April leasing rates are doing so far, what you're seeing in April in various markets?",
			"<strong>Michael D. Lacy</strong>",
			"Jeff, let me take that. And I think it's important to just give you a few other points as we think about April. And I want to reiterate, we're on track with our initial guidance. The year is playing out as we expected as a whole. And again, we've said this before, guidance assumed 2.5% blends for the year. With our 3.5% in the first quarter, we only need that 2% for the remainder of the year, so just to kind of put that in perspective.<br/>As far as regions go, East Coast is still doing extremely well. We're seeing occupancy in that 97% range, blends in the 6% range in both New York and Boston. And then the West Coast right now is basically in line with our expectations, so we feel pretty good about the West Coast. Right now, Sunbelt is a little bit weaker than we would have expected. Still seeing pretty strong blends coming out of that part of the country, but that's a little bit off from what we originally had for our plan for the year.<br/>As far as April goes, though, it looks a lot like 1Q. Our blends are in that 3.5% range. We're seeing new lease growth continue to increase month-over-month. Our occupancy is in that 96.6% range, which is comparable to what we had in 1Q. Traffic is picking up based on seasonality, kind of where we expected. And we're sitting right now with less long-term delinquents than we've had in a very long time. So we feel pretty good about where our occupancy is today going into the season.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Next question, Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.",
			"<strong>Austin Todd Wurschmidt</strong>",
			"Yes. I was just curious, Mike, which markets saw the biggest moves in month-over-month improvement on new lease pricing April versus March? And then specifically on New York, I mean, how long do you think the momentum you saw -- how long do you think the momentum could continue, I guess, versus how it performed in the first quarter?",
			"<strong>Michael D. Lacy</strong>",
			"Sure. Thanks for the question, Austin. Still seeing the most growth on the East Coast. And to your point, New York, it's coming down a little bit from those highs of 18%, 20% blends, but we're still seeing 6% to 8% today. So still strong, probably the strongest month-over-month today followed by -- I would tell you, Boston feels good as well as D.C. starting to pick up. And then the others are pretty much in line with where we were in March. New York specifically, I think they still have a little runway. We're still seeing a lot of traffic come to that market. No concessions to speak of, and with occupancy where it is today, close to 98%, we feel pretty good about continuing to push.",
			"<strong>Austin Todd Wurschmidt</strong>",
			"That's very helpful color. And then as it relates to potential joint venture, I guess, what's the latest update around the interest from potential partners and timing of announcements? I guess, has there been any change in sort of your initial expectation on pricing as it relates to just contributing those assets?",
			"<strong>Joseph D. Fisher</strong>",
			"Austin, it's Joe. Yes, first off, I would say, obviously, we've got a great partner in MetLife. It's been a very good long-term partner that we continue to work well with, so no change on that front. Strategically, as we think about joint venture capital, I think we've talked about it in the past, on these calls and with investors, I think we've proven out over the last couple of years that we have a value creation mechanism in terms of the operational platform and its ability to add excess NOI margin to new acquisitions. And so we've proven that out, utilizing our own equity when that's available and priced right.<br/>But being a public company, we don't always have that capability. And so a joint venture would allow us the opportunity to be in the market throughout the cycle to be able to utilize dry powder sourced through a JV, through a seed capital, which would come at fairly efficient pricing, and be able to go out there and transact in this market and then go lift NOI and cash flow growth. So it does a number of things for us. You get the cash flow growth on the assets. You obviously get fee streams that enhance the incremental ROE on each dollar that we deploy. You're getting scale along the way as long as we continue to buy that deal next door and keep helping both the consolidated and JV portfolio.<br/>So overall, still strategically have a desire to do that. We continue to advance discussions on that. No update at this time. But on the pricing front, I think pricing today, plus or minus 5% cap rates, is kind of where the market has settled in. So I would hope to, if we do have something, be able to source capital at that level.",

			"Just following up on that because I think you just mentioned cap rates maybe in the 5s. I think last quarter, you said maybe the bid/ask was something in the high 4s to mid-5s. And so just wondering if you can talk a bit more about just what you're seeing out there in the transaction market and what your crystal ball looks like on how that evolves over the balance of the year.",
			"<strong>H. Andrew Cantor</strong>",
			"Tony, it's Andrew. I'll take that one. In general, as Joe said, we remain focused on a capital-light strategy at this point. We are having a lot of conversations and staying connected to the market, underwriting a number of deals. I think pricing is definitely more in that 5% to 5.25% range today. With us focusing on platform and the deal next door, if and when we get back in the market will be our focus and be able to utilize the benefits of our platform that have been discussed where we can add value from acquiring from other owners and operators and to layer on Mike's team and the platform that we've created.",
			"<strong>Anthony Paolone</strong>",
			"Okay. And then just second one on the DCP book, I guess, somewhat related to allocating capital. I mean what's the comfort level and desire to kind of keep it at this level versus either seeing more opportunities out there to do more or even get paid back on what you have?",
			"<strong>Joseph D. Fisher</strong>",
			"Yes, it's a good question. I guess, as with everything within kind of our diversified platform, it's all things in moderation. So as a percentage of enterprise, we're about 2% of enterprise value within the DCP book. We've talked about a willingness to take that a little bit higher from kind of that $0.5 billion type of number. We have had actually JV discussions around that as well. We think that's an area that could be an opportunity for us to source alternative forms of capital and help expand that book and the ROE on those investments, but also not increase our exposure too materially. So it's an area that we're looking at today. <br/>I would say that the book of business available or the pipeline has come off quite a bit. You've seen a lot with, obviously, the regional banks pulling back on overall construction lending. You've seen it become more difficult to line up equity partners for new developments. And so our DCP book, being a byproduct of that, has pulled back. And so little bit less of a pipeline today which, for DCP deployment, not necessarily a near-term positive, but I think for overall fundamentals and the $1.6 billion of revenue, we have clearly a positive when you start thinking about a smaller supply pipeline going into the second half of '24 and into '25.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Your next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo.",
			"<strong>James Colin Feldman</strong>",
			"Can you talk more about what you're seeing in terms of urban versus suburban performance and the A versus B assets across the different markets?",
			"<strong>Michael D. Lacy</strong>",
			"Sure. Specific to the Bs, we actually have seen a little bit more outperformance. So I would say, thinking about blends, probably 70 to 100 basis points more on the Bs today than the As. Occupancy has been relatively stable, around that 96.5% to 96.7%, both A and B, so not a big difference there. So I'd say right now, the price point on Bs is a little bit stronger, and that's kind of what we expected for the year.",
			"<strong>James Colin Feldman</strong>",
			"And then what about like your urban assets versus your suburban assets?",
			"<strong>Michael D. Lacy</strong>",
			"Urban's still doing a little bit better, and I would point specifically to places like Boston, D.C. for us today as well as SoMa in San Francisco. Those parts of those markets are doing a little bit better than some of the things on the outskirts. It's not materially different, but urban is a little bit stronger. We do expect that some of the suburban starts to bounce back midyear this year and probably converge, to some degree.",
			"<strong>James Colin Feldman</strong>",
			"Okay. And then for my second question, what would you say is the key downside risk in terms of your same-store expense guidance, whether it's taxes, insurance, R&amp;M? And where do you feel like you have the least visibility right now?",
			"<strong>Michael D. Lacy</strong>",
			"We feel pretty good in terms of taxes and insurance today. I would tell you more on the controllable front, just with what we've seen with turnover, you have a little bit of pressure on R&amp;M. That being said, I think we've done a really good job with putting in place our technology around maintenance. We just rolled that out about 3 weeks ago across the entire portfolio. So we think we've got some things that can help mitigate expenses going forward there. We are starting to roll out more of those unmanned properties as we move into the season here, so that will help mitigate on personnel expense. And A&amp;M costs typically go with turnover, so if you have more evictions, skips, things of that nature, you could have more attorney fees. But it's minimal. So I'd tell you right now, turnover, to some degree, but we do believe we have it mitigated.",
			"<strong>Joseph D. Fisher</strong>",
			"Yes. And just to follow up on that, Jamie, a couple of comments. We've been asked a few times about kind of cadence of expenses. And so if you go back to 2022, first half of the year was about 4% growth, second half, 7%. So we're actually coming up on easier comps when we go into the second half of the year. A lot of that was driven by, one, it was very difficult to place personnel in the first half of '22 given the labor environment, so we had a lot more open positions that we're comping against here in the first part of the year. In response to that, we did do a lot of midyear raises throughout the portfolio, and so we'll be anniversarying against that by the time we get to the second half. Mike mentioned the turnover piece and we started to have more success with long-term delinquents in the second half of the year last year as well as definitely here in the first quarter and I think second quarter, so we'll start to see, hopefully, that mitigate to some degree.<br/>And then Mike mentioned the real estate tax insurance piece. Real estate taxes today, we generally know about 70% of that number for the year at this point, so don't expect a lot of volatility there. And on the insurance side, we do our renewal in mid-December. So premiums are relatively locked in here for most of the rest of the year at kind of a 20-plus percent number. The claims can be volatile. Claims making up about 50% of the insurance number. And so that's why you see insurance in first quarter actually being down on a year-over-year basis. Premiums were up but claims were down 30-plus percent as '21 and '22 were both running at pretty significantly elevated levels relative to history. So we're starting to see that come back to a more normal run rate.",

			"Next question, Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley.",
			"<strong>Adam Kramer</strong>",
			"Just wanted to ask about capital allocation, recognizing kind of the capital-light strategy or the shift you mentioned earlier, I think you guys have been really -- have a really good chart in your deck and have shown a really kind of ability over time to kind of issue equity when you're trading above NAV and kind of sell assets to buy back shares when at a discount. Wondering how you're thinking about the buyback in that context. I think buyback was not mentioned in the supplemental. Just wondering how you're thinking about buyback kind of in current environment and at current levels.",
			"<strong>Joseph D. Fisher</strong>",
			"Yes. So clearly, we've been active in the past on buybacks. We did some in the second half of last year. We've done some in the previous years when we get to discount. So I'd say last year was a relatively easier decision given that we had previously issued equity on a forward basis in the first half of '22, up in the high 50s. And so you had an identified source of capital at a very compelling price, i.e., roughly a 4% cap, and we're able to buy back stock in the high 5s.<br/>If you fast forward to where we're at today, we are in a capital-light strategy. Sources and uses are relatively balanced with a relatively light forward development and debt commitments in terms of maturities. So I feel good on sources and uses. I think we do need to figure out where we would find and where we would price that additional source today if we did want to do a buyback. We talked earlier on the call about exploring joint venture capital. That could potentially create some dry powder for us to deploy and do both operating assets, DCP and potentially buyback. So that would be part of that discussion if and when we ultimately source some capital there. But right now, sticking to the capital-light strategy, it's something that we'll consider, but nothing there in the first quarter.",
			"<strong>Adam Kramer</strong>",
			"Great. That's super helpful. And just maybe switching gears, thinking about affordability. Maybe just talk a little bit about that. I know you guys have had some really good numbers in your slide deck historically. Maybe just whether it's kind of the latest moving data, affordability there and maybe even kind of tech tenants or tech employed tenant exposure, is there any kind of numbers around that you're able to quantify? I think that would be helpful as well.",
			"<strong>Michael D. Lacy</strong>",
			"Yes, I'll start, and Joe, you can clean me up here. But from what we're seeing, one thing I would point to is, just on the affordability aspect, people aren't moving out to buy homes. We are seeing right around 5% moving out to do so. That typically runs around 12%, so we're just not seeing much on that front. In terms of people leaving because of rent increases, that is around 10% today, significantly down from mid last year when we were around 18%. And so we're starting to see that come down to some degree as well. Not seeing people double-up. We always talk about how many people are in our units, still right around 1.8 and we're not seeing people transfer down to smaller units. So right now, it feels pretty good. Joe, anything you'd add to that?",
			"<strong>Joseph D. Fisher</strong>",
			"No.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Next question, Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs.",
			"<strong>Chandni Luthra</strong>",
			"You gave us some thoughts on the Sunbelt. You talked about the East Coast. Could you perhaps throw some color on the West Coast, particularly markets like San Fran and Seattle? What are you seeing in these markets from a pricing standpoint and then from a concession standpoint? Like, did things get worse in the last 2 months?",
			"<strong>Michael D. Lacy</strong>",
			"It's a good question. I've received a few of those lately. I'd tell you, again, the West Coast feels pretty much in line with what we expected. And I'll break it down a little bit for you, starting with the Pacific Northwest. Seattle for us, we're not really utilizing any concessions. That being said, market rents have been a little bit weaker than we expected going into the year. Market rents are starting to pick up as of late. And our occupancy is still in that 96.5% range. So Seattle feels good.<br/>I think specific to some of our submarkets, Everett, Kirkland, places like that, we saw around 10%, 11% growth. So we're seeing a little bit more strength out in the suburbs. Bellevue today, still relatively strong, no concessions, about 5% to 6% growth. So that's the landscape of Seattle. In terms of San Francisco, SoMa is still doing really well for us. We saw almost 14% growth during the quarter, and we're still seeing about a 2-week concession. That seems pretty average. We've had 2 weeks for about 18 months now, and it's just kind of par for the course, if you will. When you start to go down the peninsula, not really offering concessions today. Occupancy is in that 96%, 97% range. And we're still seeing pretty decent blends. So traffic is starting to pick up in San Francisco. <br/>Down along kind of the SoCal, if you will, L.A. has been very strong for us. This is a 3.5% NOI market, so relatively small, and our exposure is mainly limited to Marina del Rey. We've had a lot of success there. Occupancy is in that 97% range, no concessions to speak of and market rents continue to move up. So I feel pretty good about L.A. And then Orange County's been just steady as it goes, occupancy 96% to 97%, no concessions. Market rents continue to improve as we move into the seasonal part of the year. So right now, SoCal feels pretty good for us.",
			"<strong>Chandni Luthra</strong>",
			"Great. And as a follow-up, could you discuss how the impact of eviction moratoriums ending in L.A. has played out for you? Like, what portion of delinquent tenants paid back all their past dues in full? What portion just decided to sort of give back keys and leave? What's the ultimate upside? And how do you think about any near-term headwind to vacancy from this dynamic?",
			"<strong>Christopher Van ens</strong>",
			"Chandni, it's Chris. I can help you out with that. So when the county eviction moratorium went away at the end of March, we had about 70 long-term delinquents in the portfolio. Once again, as Mike said, it's a pretty small market, it was 3.5% of NOI. But of those 70, about 40 came in and paid us right away as far as April rents. So they still have a balance that's due but they paid us April rent. Probably 2 to 3 people came in, paid April rent and paid off their entire balance. The remainder of them are either under eviction, sued -- served a payer quit notice, something like that. So we're working through that process right now.",
			"<strong>Joseph D. Fisher</strong>",
			"Yes. And just maybe some higher-level comments as it relates to the rest of the portfolio. Just a reminder, overall, we guided to mid-98% collected for 2023, which is pretty consistent with where we're at in 2022. I'd say we're seeing minimal variability at this point in time to that number. So don't see any downside, really don't see a lot of upside. Over time, we can probably get back to maybe a 99% collected for the portfolio. But going back to the mid-99s where we used to run is going to be exceedingly difficult just given eviction diversion programs in a lot of our portfolio.<br/>So somewhere in the mid-98s is where we're at. We did have a little bit higher write-offs than expected in the first quarter as we've had really good success getting some of those long-term delinquents out of the portfolio. We thought that would have taken a little bit longer throughout this year. And so while it was a little bit of a drag on both sequential and year-over-year revenue growth, we do think it's a tailwind as we go through the rest of this year on both sequential and year-over-year as we keep moving throughout the year on that front.<br/>So overall, feeling really good. I mean when you look at collections in the month as well as in April, March and April are running much higher than they were in 2022 in terms of in-the-month collections. And so between collections getting better, getting new residents in and also as we have some of these eviction moratoriums having come off and converting formerly nonpaying residents back to paying, we feel really good about where we're tracking in terms of guidance and the bad debt number.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Next question, Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.",
			"<strong>Juan Carlos Sanabria</strong>",
			"Just on the investment side, notwithstanding your capital-light strategy today and maybe the cost of capital not where you want it exactly, but curious what markets would look the best. With your kind of forward-thinking data analytic approach, sometimes it's a bit contrarian. Just curious, as you look out a couple of years, where you see the best opportunities across your opportunity set.",
			"<strong>Joseph D. Fisher</strong>",
			"Juan, it's Joe. I mean I guess, number one, the area that we always have the most conviction is the transaction down the street. So if we can find another property nearby, no matter what market, there's so much efficiencies to gain out of that and additional scale to gain out of that. So we're never going to redline certain markets. We'll always be looking for deal next door. <br/>Beyond that, if we did have a source of capital that was compelling today, there's markets in every region that look good. If you go down into the Sunbelt, I'd say Dallas looks more compelling to us. Even Nashville, even though it has headwinds today, from a longer-term perspective, you're seeing permit activity come off really dramatically in Nashville at this point in time. So there's a couple of Sunbelt markets that we like.<br/>Out East, Philly's really been on a tear here recently in terms of market rent growth and continues to screen well for us as does D.C. and Boston from a longer-term perspective. And then out West, you look at maybe suburban San Diego. There's interest in Northern California, actually screens well from a quant perspective but you really got to pick and choose your points given the regulatory environment there and certain municipalities. And so that one is a little bit more challenging on the regulatory front. <br/>But I think overall, there's a lot of areas that we can pick and choose from. That's one of the benefits of being diversified. So if we do have a cost of capital or source of capital that's compelling, that's kind of where we'll look.",
			"<strong>Juan Carlos Sanabria</strong>",
			"And then just on renewals, you mentioned kind of the spread blew out between the new and the renewal spreads over the quarter. Just curious on how we should think about that for the balance of '23, maybe just how you're thinking about that in your own budget and where the May and June renewals have gone out at present.",
			"<strong>Michael D. Lacy</strong>",
			"Great question. What we're sending out today basically through June at this point is in that 5.5% to 6% range. We expect it to stabilize in that range probably over the next few months, maybe come down in that 5% to 6% going forward. And then new lease growth continues to move up on a month-over-month basis. So obviously, that spread will continue to compress.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Next question, Michael Goldsmith with UBS.",
			"<strong>Michael Goldsmith</strong>",
			"Mike, in your opening remarks, you described traffic is in line with last year but also commented the demand is relatively healthy. So does that imply that conversion is lower or something else is weighing on demand despite similar traffic?",
			"<strong>Michael D. Lacy</strong>",
			"That's a good catch. We have seen some of those conversion numbers come down a little bit just with some of the affordability that's down in the Sunbelt. So more cancels and denials. And it's really a product of people searching the market, getting an understanding of what's there for new supply, what concessions are being offered. So at times, we do have more people canceling. But we're still netting out where we need to be. And obviously, with our occupancy in that 96.5% to 96.7% range, we're still holding where we need to be. So feel pretty good about it.",
			"<strong>Michael Goldsmith</strong>",
			"Got it. And then, Tom, in your opening remarks, you talked about that the geographic diversity of your portfolio allow you to allocate capital in the markets that are most advantageous. You've kind of shifted to this balance sheet-light strategy where your active development pipeline includes Dallas and Tampa. So should we interpret that as these are the markets where you see the most opportunity?",
			"<strong>Thomas W. Toomey</strong>",
			"Yes, I'll kick it back to Joe. I think Joe highlighted it very earlier in the Q&amp;A with respect to we're always going to look for the deal next door where we can achieve the high level of efficiency and, in some cases, as Mike has done, actually operate assets with no one on site. So whether that's Tampa, Dallas. I think then we go to Chris and his analytics of where we think rents are trending with respect to the next 4 and 10 years, and that's our targeting aspect of it.<br/>The good news, as Joe also mentioned, was we're in 21 markets today, so that gives us a broad range of looking at where we can accretively deploy capital at any given time. And capital-light strategy is a reflection of where we currently trade with respect to our stock price and where we think assets would trade. So when that's not there, we turn to our other value creation mechanisms. And you've seen us highlight those over the years from either operations, innovation, to DCP, to redevelopment, which is probably gaining more steam in our mind these days as we see stabilization and growth prospects in these markets return or accelerate, in some cases.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Next question, Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.",
			"<strong>Daniel Peter Tricarico</strong>",
			"This is Dan Tricarico with Nick. First question, Mike, you may have said new lease rates in the Sunbelt have been a bit weaker than expected. So I'm curious if you could expect a relative softness there in relation to how you view the occupancy rent trade-offs entering like the peak season.",
			"<strong>Michael D. Lacy</strong>",
			"Yes, Dan. Again, we're still seeing healthy growth in the Sunbelt. It's just a little bit off from our original expectations. And we have seen market rents start to move up over the last 3 or 4 weeks there. So on a month-over-month basis, it continues to improve. It's just a little bit off from, again, what we said originally going into the year.",
			"<strong>Daniel Peter Tricarico</strong>",
			"Sure. Okay. And then I guess, switching to the other Coast. So in your Northern California and Seattle portfolios, do you have a sense of what percentage of your tenants are employed by tech or big tech companies? And have you seen any increase in move-outs quoting job loss as the reason? Or do you think there's been sufficient rehiring to mitigate that given the job market strength that you quoted?",
			"<strong>Michael D. Lacy</strong>",
			"Yes. No, we watch that very closely, and we're still right around 13% to 15% exposure in both San Francisco and Seattle as a whole. We haven't seen a lot of people come in and drop off keys because of job-related events. And we continue to see in-migration in those areas. So again, it's not a lot of our exposure today and not seeing a lot of issues, if you will.",
			"<strong>Joseph D. Fisher</strong>",
			"Dan, it's Joe, maybe a couple of things to add to that, too. Just I know those 2 markets get a lot of focus given some of the headlines around the tech layoffs. But a number of individuals that are on this call have done some pretty extensive analysis on the warrant notices. We do our own analysis as well on that. And typically, you see maybe about 20% of those notices actually reside within California and Washington for those tech layoffs. So it is pretty well dispersed around the country. I think when you look at our blended lease rate activity in those 2 markets, both of those markets actually saw acceleration from 4Q into 1Q. So I think it gives you a sense that the layoffs are pretty diversified. Supply is actually coming down in Northern California. And from what we're seeing on the ground, we're actually seeing pretty good traction.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Next question, Anthony Powell with Barclays.",
			"<strong>Anthony Franklin Powell</strong>",
			"I had a question around, I think, the April lease spreads again, which I think you mentioned a few times. So in the first quarter, you had blended spreads of 3.5%. And I believe in the prepared remarks, you talked about 2Q being closer to 3%. But in a Q&amp;A question, I believe you said 3.5% for April. So I wanted to make sure all those numbers were correct and maybe kind of tie them up.",
			"<strong>Michael D. Lacy</strong>",
			"Sure. The 2Q, when we've referenced 3%, that is anchored towards our initial guidance. So it's still early in the quarter. Again, April looks a lot like 1Q. It all will hinge on what's going on with new lease growth. So again, if we're sending out 5.5% to 6% renewals through the remainder of 2Q, expect to see a little bit of improvement in new growth going into May, and then we'll have to see what June has to offer. But today, things are trending slightly better than that.",
			"<strong>Anthony Franklin Powell</strong>",
			"Got it. And maybe on the affordability, I think you've mentioned a few times that people aren't moving out to buy homes. It's more affordable to rent now and that fewer of your tenants are reporting affordability as an issue. That suggests that there's actually more pricing power than you're taking advantage of. So I'm curious if you agree with that. And maybe what's preventing you for pushing more on rent given kind of these favorable trends you talked about?",
			"<strong>Michael D. Lacy</strong>",
			"I think that's where you see the spread between renewals and new leases. We are taking advantage of it today and we have been probably in the last 18 months or so. Typically, we're sending out renewals about $100 to $130 over market. And so that's why you have basically a 5% spread between new lease and renewals today. So we feel like we're aggressively pricing that but also trying to keep in mind retention is a key factor for us and obviously helps drive new lease growth as well.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Next question, Alan Peterson with Green Street.",
			"<strong>Alan Robert Peterson</strong>",
			"Mike, in terms of your proactiveness in using concessions in San Francisco, can you share what other markets you're needing to be proactive in using concessions? And are you expecting to use concessions over the balance of the year to maintain this mid-96% occupancy level?",
			"<strong>Michael D. Lacy</strong>",
			"Yes, Alan, what I would tell you, it's been kind of more of the same. Similar, again, in April, we're seeing similar trends. We're still offering concessions in those pockets. It's in San Francisco, parts of D.C., and it's extremely minimal in cases down in the Sunbelt. Right now, what I would tell you, April again looks very similar. I don't expect that we're going to go up more than, call it, a week per new lease and going forward into the season. Demand is still strong. We still have plenty of visits coming to the property. We're going to continue to balance that. I don't expect concessions to be much of a drag on us.",
			"<strong>Alan Robert Peterson</strong>",
			"Appreciate that. And then maybe just shifting over to the DCP portfolio. For the deals that are maturing within the next 12 to 18 months, are you guys seeing any weakness on lease-up? Or are your development partners concerned about refinancing the more senior portion of those debt and construction loans?",
			"<strong>Joseph D. Fisher</strong>",
			"Alan, just I'll give some context on that. I mean I think you're right to focus on the near term. We get questions on this, leading up of the call as well as last night, kind of trying to understand if there's any stress in the system. I'd say, number one, as mentioned earlier, it's only 2% of enterprise value. And when you look on Attachment 11b, clearly fairly well diversified, not just by market but also maturity schedule.<br/>And so we've got a couple of questions on capital stack, so I'll kind of address that here as a part of your question. If you look at the overall capital stack for our DCP book, and I'm going to kick out the portfolio recap deal as well as the Portland deals, which we're also operating recaps, so a little bit different risk profile, so just looking at more of the development deals. We've got about a $1.6 billion cost for that development portfolio. There's about $950 million of senior loan, so call it, 60% loan to cost. Our commitment was about $350 million on those deals, so 60% to 80%, and then you had about $300 million of equity behind us. So a pretty good amount of equity sitting behind us on all those transactions. <br/>When you focus on these upcoming maturities, you got one in Philly, Santa Monica and Oakland. Those are about $360 million of total cost. When you look at the capital stack within those, you've got a senior loan that's about $215 million. You've got commitment from UDR for the portion of about $90 million, and we had about $55 million of equity originally behind us on those.<br/>Now we've continued to accrue up our interest income. So our basis today on an accrual basis is a little bit higher than that initial but still pretty sufficient equity behind us. So at this point in time, yes, we haven't taken any impairments on those. We are, of course, starting to have the discussions with our equity partners as well as lenders, trying to think through what their plan is in terms of do they want to restructure, do they want to exit through a sale, do they simply want to extend with the senior and see what happens on a go-forward basis. So no stress to speak of right now but not to say it won't develop over time, depend on where refi rates are and fundamentals.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Next question, Flora Tong with Evercore ISI.",
			"<strong>Flora Tong</strong>",
			"I guess the acquisition volume remains unchanged at 0. And I wonder if you're seeing more distressed opportunities coming into the market. And separately, are you seeing a big slowdown in new starts or planned starts from maybe some of the and the merchant builders?",
			"<strong>Joseph D. Fisher</strong>",
			"So yes, I guess to kind of bifurcate distressed comment into 2 different buckets, so there's -- is there a distressed pricing and/or are there distressed equity partners. On the former, I would say no. If you're a seller and you're willing to meet the market at that plus or minus 5% cap rate range, we don't think of that as distressed. You're not going to be able to buy a 6% cap in a 5% cap environment. So if you're a seller that's willing to meet the market, in multifamily where you have pretty substantial capital flows, it's a preferred asset class. And of course, we have the benefits of the GSEs, which are still lending kind of in that high 4% range. We don't think you see distressed pricing. Now you could, of course, see equity deals on merchants that maybe got upside down, got too far out over their skis in terms of underwriting or how they financed, but that doesn't necessarily lead to distressed pricing. So I don't think that's going to necessarily occur.<br/>In terms of the forward pipeline and what's taking place in supply, yes, you're starting to see it in some of the numbers with some of the starts and permit activity for multifamily coming off, call it, 5% to 10% from peak levels in 2022. I think when you look at broader, kind of total housing supply, clearly, the single-family space haven't come off 30-plus percent, and therefore, total housing supply coming off about 20%. You are starting to see the impact of that. It's probably not going to flow through until you get into second half of '24 and then 2025. So it's ways out there.<br/>I mentioned earlier within our DCP pipeline just what we're seeing in terms of new deals, it's off dramatically, which tells you, because of what's going on in the regional bank space, what's going on with ability to raise equity, you're going to start seeing way fewer starts on a go-forward basis. So we do think that's going to be a future tailwind.",
			"<strong>Thomas W. Toomey</strong>",
			"Flora, this is Toomey. Just one thing to add to your calculus when you're thinking about this, the multifamily industry enjoys the benefit and partnership with the GSEs, provide a stable capital flow that helps the transaction market continue to flow, the refi market continue to flow. And so there's not this historical just everything's got to be sold and there's no capital, so it's vulture time, if you will, that occurs in the multifamily industry as long as we have the GSE. So it's a unique animal for us and very beneficial through periods like this, as I mentioned earlier, capital markets recession.",
			"<strong>Flora Tong</strong>",
			"That's really helpful. And maybe shifting to the technology, I know UDR has been fairly active on the innovation front. Have you seen any opportunity associated with artificial intelligence, such as ChatGPT or other language model, that can help UDR create further technology efficiencies going forward?",

			"We have seen that. We've actually rolled out AI chat, text and call across the portfolio over the last 12 months. And so that's already being utilized throughout our portfolio. There are going to be additional opportunities that we think going forward. We've already started to kind of sketching those out in terms of how do you provide the customer kind of individualized responses, how to give them more automated responses but feel like they are addressing their specific questions, they understand their specific history, what their issues could be. So there's definitely going to be an opportunity for that in terms of the customer experience and providing them a better customer experience but also, from a cost perspective, how to bring our cost structure down. So we are looking at it, I think it's pretty early days other than what we've done on the AI chat side.",
			"<strong>Thomas W. Toomey</strong>",
			"And Flora, just one data point, Toomey again. With respect to the AI chat piece, surprisingly enough, it closes better than we thought it would. It's about a 10% higher closing rate on our sales than we've seen through a natural call center-type template. So customers are embracing it, so it must be working.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Next question, Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.",
			"<strong>Alexander David Goldfarb</strong>",
			"So just really quick 2 quickies. First, Joe, on the insurance front, is there opportunity for you guys to increase the amount that you self-insure to try and mitigate some of the large premium increases or some of the carriers or reinsurers pulling back?",
			"<strong>Joseph D. Fisher</strong>",
			"Yes, Alex, good question. That's actually an analysis we go through every single year, looking at every single layer, how the layers are being filled in and how pricing is relative to loss history. And so each year, we go through that analysis. So when it comes up for renewal again in December, we'll go through that same analysis. I think with capacity having pulled back in the space and despite premiums going higher, it really hasn't returned. Some of the profit margins that these insurers are taking are pretty substantial relative to loss history. So it's one of the advantages of, obviously, being a pretty large diversified company that's well capitalized relative to being a private operator that may not have that capability and has to just take on that premium increase. So it's something we'll be looking at.",
			"<strong>Alexander David Goldfarb</strong>",
			"Okay. And then the second question just quickly, you guys mentioned the Sunbelt being weaker but you also mentioned that your B portfolio isn't really being impacted by the supply. So just sort of curious if that was sort of a relative because East Coast is performing better than you thought, maybe you expected better out of Sunbelt or if you're just saying more Sunbelt broadly but not really about your assets in particular?",
			"<strong>Michael D. Lacy</strong>",
			"Alex, I think it does go back to East Coast just doing better, in general. And where we are seeing pockets of weakness, it's more in those urban settings in the Sunbelt because that's where the supply is coming from. So that's why the Bs are outperforming a little bit more down there than we would have expected going into the year.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Next question, Tayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse.",
			"<strong>Omotayo Tejamude Okusanya</strong>",
			"Actually, my questions have been answered. I just couldn't figure out how to get off the queue.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"I would now like to turn the floor over to Tom Toomey for closing remarks.",
			"<strong>Thomas W. Toomey</strong>",
			"This is Tom again, and thank you all for your time, interest and support of UDR. We've established ourselves as a full cycle investment that delivers above-average growth and total shareholder return across a variety of macro environments. We remain very enthusiastic about the apartment business and believe our operating capital allocation and innovation advantages should deliver relative outperformance versus peers in 2023 and beyond. .<br/>And with that, we look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT conference in June as well as upcoming individual events. With that, take care.",

			"High living costs have pummeled citizens in nearly every country in the world these past twelve months. While inflation in the Western world has remained below 10% for most of the time, in emerging markets it has crossed double digits and unleashed unthinkable economic burdens on vast chunks of populations.",
			"At the same time, while rapid inflation rises are a relatively recent phenomenon ushered primarily due to the fiscal largess during the coronavirus pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, rents today have been growing for decades. Taking the example of the U.S., <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:data;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUUR0000SEHA\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">data</a> from the Federal Reserve shows that using 1983 as a base year and ascribing it an index value of 100 shows that rents have grown by a massive 288% in the past four decades. In absolute terms, historic median rents <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:stood at $423;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://ipropertymanagement.com/research/average-rent-by-year\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">stood at $423</a> in 1985, and at $1,180 as of January 2023 to mark a 178% growth. As is the case with most macroeconomic and financial comparisons, they rarely yield value on their own, so to generate more insight lets compare them with the income growth in America during the same time period. At this front, data from the Census Bureau shows that median income in the U.S. was a little over $50,000 in 1967, and since then, it has grown to $70,784 as of 2021.",
			"In percentage terms, this marks a mere 39% growth - indicating that Americans are paying more of their money simply to rent. To add to this, a <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:2017 report;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2017/07/19/more-u-s-households-are-renting-than-at-any-point-in-50-years/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2017 report</a> from Pew Research shows that the number of household heads who were renters grew from 21.3% in 1965 to 43.3% in 2016. This bit of data is interesting, as it shows that the proportion of renters has drastically increased over the past decade. This is due to the fact that while between 1965 and 2016, the percentage of household heads that were homeowners also grew from 36.2% to 75%, it had actually peaked at 76% in 2006 - just before the Great Recession hit.",
			"Rents also jumped last year, as a wave of inflation that might cool down soon now was just about to peak. For instance, in Manhattan, which is one of the most expensive areas to live in the U.S., saw the average monthly rent jump to a whopping <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:$5,000;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/14/average-rent-in-manhattan-was-a-record-5000-last-month.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$5,000</a> for the first time in history in July 2022. This came at a time when average rent in America <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:jumped to $2,000;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.redfin.com/news/redfin-rental-report-may-2022/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">jumped to $2,000</a> as the pandemic ended up changing the market dynamics. This also marked a 15% annual growth in May 2022, up from the 4% growth in May 2021.",
			"This makes it clear that the real estate market as a whole has been booming for the past couple of years. At the same time, it is also having to deal with changes that appear to be permanent. The pandemic saw vast chunks of populations switch to remote working, and according to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:research from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC);elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/financial-services/asset-wealth-management/real-estate/emerging-trends-in-real-estate.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">research from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)</a>, as much as 20% of office real estate properties might have to be repurposed as the demand for working spaces drops. Additionally, trends in the market are shifting from the generally popular coastal areas to the western and southern regions, such as Nashville, Dallas, and Forth Worth.",

Cumulatively, these firms have a market capitalization of roughly $450 billion, which is greater than the next fifteen companies, most of which are also American.",
			"Additionally, while real estate is generally thought to be related to residential and office spaces, the reality is that there are budding new sectors as well.

			"The residential real estate market is also worth trillions of dollars. Research from Leanprop shows that as a whole, there are a whopping $2.8 trillion worth homes available for sale in the U.S., with six million homes sold each year.

There's a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday's afternoon's press release as well as in the company's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. <br/>I'll now turn the call over to Ben Schall, Chairman and -- CEO and President of AvalonBay for his remarks. Ben?",
			"<strong>Benjamin W. Schall</strong>",
			"Thanks, Jason. In terms of key themes for this quarter, I will start by reviewing our strong start to the year and describe why we believe our suburban coastal portfolio is particularly well positioned. Sean will discuss our operating performance and relative strength as we enter the peak leasing season. Matt will comment on the evolving development market and detail the differentiated earnings stream that our developments currently underway set to provide. And Kevin will review our strong financial position and highlight the advancements at our industry-leading centralized service center we utilize to drive revenue and operating efficiencies. <br/>Turning to our presentation, starting on Page 4. We continue to meaningfully grow earnings in Q1 with core FFO increasing 13.7%. A significant part of this uplift is related to the roll-through of leases signed last year. We also continue to grow rents during Q1 with like-term effective rent change of 4.1%. For the quarter, we exceeded core FFO guidance by $0.05, with the $0.01 of revenue primarily attributable to better-than-expected collection rates from residents, $0.03 due to lower operating expenses and $0.01 related to interest income and other items. <br/>In early April, we drew down the proceeds of our equity forward, which we entered into about a year ago, at the spot price of $255 per share. A couple of items to highlight here. First, the additional cost of this $500 million of capital is in the low-4% range. As was originally intended, we've allocated this capital to development projects underway, which are projected to generate development yields of 6% or more. So when we talk about funding our underway development at yesterday's capital cost, this almost 200 basis point spread is what we're referring to and leads to significant value creation for shareholders as these projects stabilize. <br/>The second aspect of the drawdown of the equity forward is unique to the current environment in which we can earn outsized returns on cash. We weren't originally planning to draw down the equity forward until Q4 of this year, but we executed it now and have invested the cash at 5%-plus interest rates with extremely strong banking partners. <br/>On a net basis, the incremental income on this cash is projected to increase 2023 core FFO by approximately $0.03 per share, after factoring in the incremental shares outstanding. We, in turn, increased our full year core FFO guidance by $0.10 to $10.41 per share at the midpoint. The breakdown is as follows: $0.02 in revenue with the $0.01 from Q1 and then an additional $0.01 in Q2 based on slightly better rental rates. There's an assumed $0.02 improvement for operating expenses for the full year, which includes the $0.03 from Q1, partially offset by $0.01 higher OpEx in the second half of the year. And then $0.06 of additional core FFO, primarily from the interest income on the equity forward proceeds as well as other cash management and slightly updated assumptions related to the transaction timing. We do not adjust our same-store guidance ranges at this point, and we'll reevaluate those as part of our more fulsome midyear we forecast. <br/>Turning to Page 5 regarding market fundamentals. Occupancy and rent trends in our established regions are experiencing less volatility than in the Sunbelt regions. Part of this is a reversion to long-term trend lines. There are also underlying demand factors providing greater stability in our established regions, and 2 are worth noting. <br/>First, rent-to-income ratios are generally in line with traditional levels. As noted in Chart 3, effective market rents in our established regions have grown about 10% over the past 3 years with income levels more than keeping pace with rent growth. And second, with limited single-family home inventory and higher interest costs, the economics of renting are considerably more favorable than buying a home in our markets. <br/>The near-term supply picture also bodes well for the performance of our suburban coaster portfolio. As shown on Page 6, our established regions have meaningfully less new supply coming online this year, estimated at 1.6% of stock as compared to Sunbelt markets at 3.6%. And as shown on the right-hand side of this page, when we look at supply that is directly competing with our portfolio, levels are even lower, at 1.4% of stock overall and only 1.2% of stock in our suburban markets, which comprises roughly 2/3 of our portfolio. <br/>In terms of our portfolio allocation objectives, we do still want to shift 25% of our portfolio to our expansion regions over time in order to diversify and optimize our longer-term growth profile. So that has not changed. And in the near term, the relative trade of selling assets in our established regions to acquire assets in the expansion regions could be more attractive to us than it has been, allowing us to more profitably reposition our portfolio for future growth. <br/>And with that, I'll turn it to Sean for more specifics on the operating backdrop.",
			"<strong>Sean J. Breslin</strong>",
			"All right. Thanks, Ben. Continuing with Slide 7 to address market trends. Effective rents in the East and West are up about 10% from pre-COVID levels but took very different paths to get to the same point. Rents on the West Coast, which have historically been more volatile than the East, declined sharply in 2020, escalated significantly in 2021 and the first half of 2022, and then softened consistent with seasonal norms in the back half of 2022. Rents on the East Coast experienced a more modest decline through COVID and have grown steadily since Q1 2021 with very modest seasonality in the back half of 2022. And consistent with historical norms, both coasts posted positive sequential monthly rent growth during the first quarter. From a year-over-year growth rate perspective, the West Coast continued to decelerate during Q1, while the East Coast showed signs of stabilization, bolstered by slightly better growth in absolute rent levels since the beginning of the year. <br/>Moving to Slide 8 to address trends in our same-store portfolio. Key performance indicators were healthy during Q1 and remained so heading into the prime leasing season. Our availability was in the low-5% range during the quarter. Turnover, which was relatively stable during the quarter, was lower than Q4 2022 as the volume of residents leaving our communities to purchase a home declined by roughly 25% sequentially and about 1/3 year-over-year. <br/>Occupancy increased about 30 basis points from Q4. And as noted in Chart 4 on Slide 8 and also in our earnings release, rent change improved from 3.7% in January to 4.9% in April. Additionally, our portfolio average asking rent has increased about 3.5% since the beginning of the year, up 4% on the East and about 3% on the West and is slightly ahead of our original expectation. Also, renewal offers from May and June went out at roughly 7%. <br/>I'll turn it over to Matt to address development now. Matt?",
			"<strong>Matthew H. Birenbaum</strong>",
			"All right. Great. Thanks, Sean. Turning to Slide 9. Our lease-ups continue to deliver outstanding results, laying the foundation for strong future growth in both earnings and NAV. We currently have 4 development communities that had active leasing in Q1, all of which started construction early in the pandemic, before rents had started to rise meaningfully. As a general rule, we do not update our projected rents on lease-ups until we open for business and start to gain leasing velocity, at which point, we mark those rents to current market levels. <br/>For these 4 deals, we have seen an increase of $485 per month or 17% above our initial underwriting. This in turn is driving a 70 basis points increase in the yield on these investments to 6.7%, well above current cap rates and even further above the cost of the capital we source to fund these deals, back when they broke ground consistent with our match funding approach. <br/>Looking ahead, we expect to start leasing on an additional 7 communities before the end of the year. We have not yet marked the rents on these projects to current market, but in general, the locations in which they're located have seen similar increases in market rent since we started construction, providing a great opportunity for further lift in their results as well. <br/>As shown on Slide 10, with most of our communities -- development communities still early in lease up are yet to open, we realized just $10 million of the total projected $142 million in NOI from the entire development booked in Q1. This leaves over $130 million of incremental NOI to come as these assets complete construction stabilize. And as for the prior slide, that total NOI figure is also likely understated, given only 4 of those 18 total projects have been marked to market today. <br/>Turning to Slide 11. As we look to future development starts, we are certainly starting to see shifts in the development market in response to the Fed tightening over the past several quarters. Among our competitors, many planned projects are being postponed or abandoned as third-party financing becomes scarce and cut off. And some of these drop land contracts are starting to come back to the market with much lower pricing expectations. We've already been able to take advantage of several of these situations with recent additions to our development rents pipeline, and we do expect to see more as the market adjusts. <br/>The slowdown in starts in turn is starting to impact the construction market, where we are finally starting to see some retraction in subcontractor trade pricing after 3 years of outsized increases. An environment where capital is scarce and certainty of execution becomes more critical, both to land sellers and subcontractors, plays well to our strengths as both the developer and the general contractor. And we have traditionally seen some of our most profitable investment opportunities when these more challenging cyclical conditions have prevailed. <br/>And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for an update on the balance sheet and the CCC.",
			"<strong>Kevin P. O'Shea</strong>",
			"Thanks, Matt. Turning to Slide 12. As we look ahead, our balance sheet remains exceptionally well positioned to provide financial strength and stability while also giving us the flexibility to continue funding attractive growth opportunities across our investment platforms. In this regard, we enjoy low leverage with net debt-to-EBITDA of 4.6x, which is below our target range of 5x to 6x. Our interest coverage ratio and unencumbered NOI percentage are at near record levels at 6.9x and 95%, respectively. And our debt maturities are well laddered, with weighted average years to maturity of about 8 years. <br/>In addition, as disclosed in our release, we also enjoyed tremendous liquidity of about $2.8 billion today, with no borrowings under our $2.25 billion unsecured credit facility and an additional $0.5 billion from just having settled our equity forward that we originated a year ago. As a result, we don't need to tap the capital markets for an extended time, and we are well positioned to lean into our balance sheets to take advantage of future investment opportunities that may emerge in our markets over time. <br/>On Slide 13, we highlight our recently announced agreement to provide back-office financial administrative support to Gables Residential's portfolio of 25,000 apartment homes from our centralized customer care center, which we established in 2007 to create operating and scale efficiencies and supporting our own portfolio while enhancing our resident customer experience. At the outset, I want to acknowledge the efforts of the entire AvalonBay team that brought this business relationship to Gables across the finish line. <br/>We highlight this achievement for several reasons. First, because we are genuinely excited to be able to extend these services to a highly respected multifamily company such as Gables and to its residents; second, because this agreement demonstrates the appeal of the innovative capabilities that we've created in the 16 years since we established the CCC; and third, because we have embarked on extending those capabilities in a way that allows us to create additional value for AvalonBay shareholders by offering to support services to other institutional multifamily owners now and in the future. <br/>As a reminder, we are not offering property management services under our agreement with Gables nor do we intend to do so. As all business and operational decisions related to AvalonBay's and Gables portfolios will continue to be managed separately by each company, rather we are providing back-office financial administrative support to Gables.<br/>And then finally, from an economic and guidance perspective, while we are not disclosing the specific terms of our agreement for confidentiality reasons, the near-term earnings accretion from this agreement is relatively modest and was included in our initial outlook given back in February 2023. <br/>With that, I'll turn it back to Ben for closing comments.",
			"<strong>Benjamin W. Schall</strong>",
			"All right. Thanks, Kevin. Page 14 summarizes our key takeaways and focus areas. We're pleased with our start to the year, expect our portfolio to outperform as we look ahead; and also mindful that these are the types of environments, particularly an environment in which capital is generally less abundant in the industry, to selectively take advantage of opportunities in order to create value for shareholders. <br/>With that, I'll now ask the operator to open the line for questions.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi.",
			"<strong>Nicholas Gregory Joseph</strong>",
			"It's actually Nick Joseph appearing for Eric. Kevin, you mentioned the agreement announced last week with Gables. I recognize you can't talk too much on the specific terms of that. But if you could talk more broadly about, is this a one-off deal? Are you looking to scale this business? What sort of margin and economics could you derive from it? And then I know this is in the third-party management contract, but would that be of interest as well for other property owners?",
			"<strong>Kevin P. O'Shea</strong>",
			"Sure. Thanks, Nick. I'll start and others, Ben or Sean may want to chime in. In terms of the go-forward view of this, we're certainly excited to have this agreement in place. And without getting into the specifics of the economics, I mean, the impact is, at the moment, fairly modest, if you just think about the relative size of our business and our main value creators outside of operations and development and so forth. But we are excited to have it in place, it is accretive. There are from a contribution point of view, healthy margins, for sure, that make this worth the while. <br/>As to the future potential, we're certainly hopeful and inspired to do more business like this, but we are not proactively looking for that new business right now. We've just completed this transaction, of course, with Gables. So -- but we do hope looking ahead to be able to do more business like this over the time. And we think it does make sense for us to do it because over time, because it allows us to scale and more fully invest over time and an important capability that allows us to further differentiate ourselves from our peers. So there's a lot more I could go into there, but maybe I'll just pause there. And I don't know if Sean or Ben have anything else to add.",
			"<strong>Benjamin W. Schall</strong>",
			"Yes. I think as well, but I'll add a couple of things, and thanks for the question, Nick. I would connect for you this step as the kind of next continued evolution, both of our operating model journey but as well as the role that the CCC and centralized services are planned for us. And so part of the appeal, in addition to the revenue and profit opportunity with Gables, we are increasingly handling more services, at least in part and at a centralized way. And this relationship allows us to make continued investments. Think about technology, process, people that we think can then accrue to the larger platform here at AvalonBay. So it's a nice next step in our overall operating model journey, and we're excited for this first step and potentially future clients going forward.",
			"<strong>Eric Wolfe</strong>",
			"It's Eric. Maybe just a follow-up there. You said that the initial sort of impact was included in guidance and wasn't, frankly, that large. I guess how many units would you sort of have to manage before it would become a sort of more material part of your earnings stream? And just to make sure that I understand the last part of your answer, I think you're effectively saying that you can sort of invest in your platform, invest in technology. And even though that the financial contribution above that might not be that big, you're effectively allocating those costs to other parties. Is that the right way to think about it? Or did I misunderstand that?",
			"<strong>Kevin P. O'Shea</strong>",
			"Yes, Eric, let me kind of take a stab at it a little bit. I can't really give you, I mean, an answer what number of units would have to be under this kind of an arrangement for it to be material. It probably depends on what you think is material, I guess, to some degree. I think the way we look at it is from a slightly different perspective, not the immediate financial impact, but it's kind of been alluded to what this sort of thing does for us to continue our journey to create the leading operating platform in the business. <br/>And so we're in our 17th year with this experience. And I think that we're pointing this out probably for 2 reasons. One, to your question about what this can do, the more you do this for not only yourself but for others, the more you can reinvest in that business, create a better platform in and of itself over time. But even for our own sake, when we started, we weren't at our current size of, whatever, 80,000 apartment homes when we started this in 2007, we were quite a bit smaller. And it has gotten better itself over time. We've really fine-tuned and honed the CCC so that it's substantially better than it was even back in 2007 and 2010 and it has done a number of things you can see on the slide here for us over time. <br/>I mean one thing it did is when we had the Archstone transaction, we were able to add 20,000 units in 30 days. So that bespoke -- that speaks to sort of the ability to scale quickly when you've got that capability centralized in-house.<br/>And the other reason why we think it's worth highlighting for you, apart from the fact that it is a relatively modest financial significance today, is the fact that a highly respected institutional multifamily owner, such as Gables, by entering and screening with us after its own due diligence on us and our center does provide external validation of the strength and the economic value of the capabilities we've created at the CCC over the past 16 years. And we think that's something that's worth emphasizing to our investors, given the increasing importance of generating alpha in our operating platform through innovation, which we're continuing to do across the entire business at this point.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore.",
			"<strong>Stephen Thomas Sakwa</strong>",
			"Pretty back-end loaded for you guys this year. I'm just curious, given Matt's comments about costs starting to come down, but the economy is potentially weakening and rent growth is slowing, how those potential starts are kind of shaping up for you? And what, I guess, are you looking for higher hurdle rates today and maybe in the back half of the year than you were, say, 6 months ago?",
			"<strong>Matthew H. Birenbaum</strong>",
			"Sure. Steve, it's Matt. Yes, so our target yield or going in initial return on new development has been rising really over the last year as we saw cap rates rise and cost of capital rise, both debt and equity. So our target yields were probably in the mid-5s, mid- to high 5s last year and now they're kind of in the mid-6s, low to mid-6s, depending on the geography and the risk associated with the deal. So our start activity for the year is as the -- it is probably a little more back half weighted just by the way these deals tend to pace out. And also we do thin that as time goes by, we're going to see more buyout savings on our hard costs. So in some -- that probably plays to our advantage a little bit. And we can play that a little more aggressively given that we act as our own general contractor, 90% of our development, which is a little different than I think many others. <br/>So -- but when I look at our development starts that are slated for this year, that's about where the yields are. They're probably in the low 6s. And you have to kind of look at the geographic mix and the risk profile of those deals to kind of weigh the profitability of each one, which is what we do. But again, we've been pretty consistent in saying we're continuing to look for that 100 to 150 basis point spread on new starts. And frankly, the stuff that we started last year and the year before, the spreads are well wider than that, which was kind of highlighted on the slide.",
			"<strong>Stephen Thomas Sakwa</strong>",
			"Yes, I guess maybe to ask it maybe a little differently. I guess what risk or what probability would you put that you don't hit the starts number for a host of reasons? Or do you feel reasonably confident that costs are coming your way and even if rent growth slows a little bit, that you're still able to kind of achieve the returns you need to kind of put that -- put those starts into the ground?",
			"<strong>Kevin P. O'Shea</strong>",
			"I feel I'm pretty confident about it. When I look at the starts for the year, we started one in the first quarter. We have one that we've just started. It will be a second quarter start, a third one where we have all of our final budgets, and it's been approved through our investment committee. So that's 3 of the 7 or 8 starts we have planned for the year. And when I look at it, the other ones, I'm feeling pretty confident that we should track that, unless something very unexpected happens.",
			"<strong>Benjamin W. Schall</strong>",
			"Steve, maybe a little bit more to your question about how is our development approach changing. And we do have a fairly fulsome development rights pipeline. And Matt's talking about our near-term starts, which are fairly baked at this point. But the next set of deals, right, in that pipeline over the next couple of years, part of what we're going through right now is very proactively -- effectively reworking those deals, right, to reflect today's environment. And given what's happening with some of our competitors, some of the formerly active developers there, sellers are starting to increasingly acknowledge that the environment has changed. And so that's leading to land repricing, that's leading to more attractive terms. It's allowing us to control high-quality real estate, relatively limited upfront costs. So all those dynamics continue to run in our direction.",
			"<strong>Stephen Thomas Sakwa</strong>",
			"Okay. Great. And then maybe just one question for Sean on -- you talked about, I guess, the renewals going out around 7%. And I know you don't provide a split between new and renewals and you kind of just provide the blend. And April was a nice uptick. I guess given that we're going in the spring leasing season, how -- I guess, how much confidence do you have that kind of the May and June numbers might look like April? Could they be better? And I guess what markets are you seeing the most strength and weakness?",
			"<strong>Sean J. Breslin</strong>",
			"Yes, Steve, good questions. Maybe I'll provide a little of a high-level commentary as it relates to renewals versus new move-ins and a little bit about trends. But in the first quarter, what I'd say is if you look at the blend there, renewals were kind of in the high 5s, and new move-ins were sort of in the mid-2% range. And then in April, renewals were sort of in the mid-5s, but new move-ins, just given the seasonality of rents, has kind of moved up into the mid-4s, just to give you some perspective there. <br/>And our expectation is that consistent with what we talked about on the first quarter call, that we would see the best rent change kind of in the first quarter, and then it would begin to decelerate. But that's dependent upon what happens with growth and asking rents as we move through the year. So our expectation is still consistent with what we communicated in Q1, is that we would see Q1 perform well, and then we would start to see some moderation, both in rent change and in overall rental revenue growth. <br/>And that's still the expectation. And part of that, you got to have to keep in mind is on a year-over-year basis, the headwind associated with the reduction in rent relief becomes more material as you get into the second and third quarter, and that will create some moderation from a rental revenue growth perspective. But as it relates to rent change, based on what we know today, I would say, as you get further into the second quarter, we would expect that to begin to moderate more so than what obviously we saw in the first quarter.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc.",
			"<strong>Austin Todd Wurschmidt</strong>",
			"Going back to Gables for a minute. I guess, I'm curious what sort of precipitated the discussions with Gables? And whether or not you pursued any other potential portfolios to add to the CCC platform? And while understanding you're not handling the property management, could we see these partnerships lead to a feeder for future acquisitions?",
			"<strong>Benjamin W. Schall</strong>",
			"Yes, Austin. On the first piece, short version of it, there were some existing relationships across the firms, which sort of started the conversations. We then went through a pilot with Gables on a smaller portion of this portfolio to test it, both for them and for us. And on the heels of that, we both decided to proceed given the benefits that were being realized. And then to your last piece, no, this is not an acquisition type of approach or angle here. This is much more focused on operational benefits.",
			"<strong>Austin Todd Wurschmidt</strong>",
			"Understood. And then going back to development. I recall some tables you provided over time showing kind of IRRs on development. And certainly, recall coming out of the GFC, there were some really attractive returns over time. So given what's going on with the availability of bank financing, the more attractive land and input costs, I guess, it seems like a unique opportunity today. So how are you thinking about ramping development as quickly as you can to maybe capitalize on what's going on today?",
			"<strong>Matthew H. Birenbaum</strong>",
			"Austin, it's Matt. I can speak to that a little bit, and then Ben may want to as well. But -- so the good news is we have a -- we're controlling a lot of really good real estate right now for very modest upfront investment. So we've kind of been operating the platform in anticipation of a potential opportunity emerging like this really for the last couple of years. And we've added quite a lot to our pipeline over the last year or 2. We're controlling, I think, 40 or 41 potential deals with pretty modest land on our balance sheet. I think it was $180 million. At the end of the quarter, the total investment, including capitalized pursuit cost, is only around $235 million or $240 million. <br/>So we have -- and a lot of those options are not yet at the point where we have to make a decision about are we going to close? Are we going to -- as Ben mentioned, there are some conversations going on with some sellers about these deals were struck in a different environment. So I think we're well positioned. I wouldn't say it's quite there yet. It's not like development economics are screening value yet. We kind of have to see where asset values settle out, and that's the other side of this is what's going on in the transaction market, which is still pretty muted deal volumes. But we do have the ability to ramp it up if we see that emerging kind of later this year, particularly when we look to next year. <br/>The other thing is, as I mentioned, we are starting to see the moderation in hard costs, particularly in some markets where start volume has come down. There are other markets where that's coming, but it's not here quite yet. So we're watching that very closely every day. And that's the other opportunity that we will see. There are some markets where we think it's going to come down more. There's other markets where it's going to take a little more time. But over particularly the next 4 or 5 months, as we have more deals out in the market actively bidding, we'll have a much better sense for where hard costs are going. Because what we're finding today is if you have a job that you're going to start in a year and you're showing preliminary drawns, you're not getting particularly attractive pricing. But if you have a job that's truly ready to go, you've got a permit in hand, subcontractors can see some early site work and they have a hole in their production schedule, that's when you're seeing the more aggressive bid.",
			"<strong>Benjamin W. Schall</strong>",
			"Two areas I'd emphasize, One, just on the point of our relatively limited land holdings, when you look across our peer set, our landholding numbers is below a number of our peers, despite kind of our ability to execute at higher development levels throughout cycles. So we've got some room in there. <br/>The second part is in an environment right now, we recognize we need to be selective about that. But in places, it could be markets we know really well, have nearby operating communities, places where we can bring our platform into. We're finding opportunities there in our expansion markets for some high-quality land deals that are falling out of contract, ability to step in. And yes, there have been a couple of situations where land is getting repriced at 30% to 35%, where it was priced 9 months ago. If we can step in and control that land with relatively limited cost to look out a couple of years, and we think that will accrue some significant benefits.",

			"Our next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley.",
			"<strong>Adam Kramer</strong>",
			"I just wanted to ask about bad debt. It looks like 500 basis points on kind of a gross basis in the quarter. Just wondering -- I know you have a really helpful kind of market-by-market breakdown there. So just wondering kind of how you're thinking about gross bad debt over the next few quarters? And is there a chance that this could be kind of -- some sort of a tailwind going into next year if this does return to -- maybe it doesn't return all the way to kind of normal pre-COVID levels, right, but just you give some year-over-year improvements on that number.",
			"<strong>Sean J. Breslin</strong>",
			"Sure, Adam. This is Sean. Just a couple of comments on that. First, as it relates to bad debt during the quarter, the sort of uncollectible portion from our residents, as we think about a sort of underlying bad debt, came in at around 3%, which is about 22 basis points better than what we anticipated. And that's the $0.01 that Ben basically spoke about in terms of what we picked up in the first quarter. <br/>Moving forward, for the balance of the year, we're expecting Q2 through Q4 to average roughly 2.7%, starting at about 3% in Q2 and then sort of trending down throughout the year in terms of that underlying sort of bad debt percentage. So that's how the sort of trajectory looks as you move forward. <br/>Different markets are doing different things. We saw some nice improvement in New York -- the Greater New York region in the first quarter. It was responsible for about half the variance in the quarter, about 1/3 in Southern Cal and then kind of sprinkled across the other markets as well. So overall, we were pleased with what we saw and we'll able to revisit that midyear once we have a better sense for how things are playing out as we move through the second quarter as well.",
			"<strong>Adam Kramer</strong>",
			"Great. That's really helpful, and I appreciate the clarification on the 300 basis points. I was wrong on my higher number there, I appreciate that. Just as a follow-up, is there a chance that you can kind of have a -- I guess, kind of more of a onetime in nature, but kind of a benefit from residents who kind of true up, right, who not only kind of stay current on rent but also pay prior periods that they had, that they were delinquent on and hadn't paid. Is it possible you can kind of see a onetime benefit from that?",
			"<strong>Sean J. Breslin</strong>",
			"Adam, what I'd say is anything is possible. I don't think that is probable based on the resident behavior we have seen thus far. So I would not anticipate that. To the extent that we, all of a sudden, cash started raining in from people who haven't paid, that's not necessarily what we've expected in our guidance, it would be a bump. But I would not expect that as a likely outcome.",

			"Our next question comes from the line of Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs.",
			"<strong>Chandni Luthra</strong>",
			"Could you talk about concessions? What are you seeing across your markets, particularly on the West Coast and perhaps even on your expansion markets? And how has the trend been in the last 19 days? Have things gone worse?",
			"<strong>Sean J. Breslin</strong>",
			"Sure, Chandni. This is Sean. Happy to answer that. First, in terms of Q1 activity, across all the leases we signed in the quarter, which was about 16,000 leases, the average concession is less than $200. So very, very modest. Obviously, more concentrated in certain places. What I would tell you is about 30% of the concession volume that we experienced in the quarter in terms of leases that were captured were spread across Seattle and the Bay Area, particularly in San Francisco. <br/>So that's where most of the volume is, frankly. But if you look at concessions over the last few weeks, just to give you a little more recent data, less than 10% of the transactions that we're executing are seeing a concession. And again, it's more concentrated in those 2 areas, San Francisco and the Pacific Northwest, where in those markets, you're 30%, 40%, 45% of the leases, depending on submarket are getting some type of a concession. So those are the 2 places where we're focused on at the most in terms of moving volume, but it's not a significant issue elsewhere.",
			"<strong>Chandni Luthra</strong>",
			"Noted. And then as a follow-up, last quarter, you laid out cap rates in the mid- to high-4s range. What are you seeing right now? And at what levels would you think that it would become appealing enough for you to dive in?",
			"<strong>Matthew H. Birenbaum</strong>",
			"Yes. This is Matt. I guess, I'll speak to that one. So what we've said of cap rates and then our own trading activity, I think what we're seeing is that there's a bifurcated market. There are a lot of assets that are not trading. Those that are, I would kind of put them into 2 buckets, kind of the haves and the have nots. The haves, which is highly desirable assets in locations, either markets or submarkets that are on a lot of investors' lists. For growth, those assets are still trading in the mid-4s cap rates. I think, in fact, I would have -- if you'd asked me 90 days ago, I probably would have said high 4s, but -- and we do have some assets actively in the market today that hopefully will close during Q2, and we have at least one that's in that haves category, I would say, that's probably more of a mid-4s ap rate. <br/>Now when I say cap rate, I'm not necessarily talking about the yield. I'm talking about kind of the market convention, the way they report a cap rate, which includes a management fee and a CapEx allowance and the buyer's property taxes. <br/>The other side of the equation is the assets that maybe have a little bit less of an interest that have a less deep pool of bidders. And there, the have nots, you might have 1 or 2 that are seriously interested. And there, I'd say cap rates are probably more like low 5s. And so call that range anywhere from 4.5 to 5.25. And we may have an asset or 2 that's in that latter category as well that's currently working in the market. <br/>As it relates to our own asset trading activity, our plan for the year was to be net neutral. But to -- really, we started last year saying, we were going to sell first and buy second. So that to the extent we're trading out of assets in our established regions into our expansion regions, we would know what the cap rate and pricing was on the asset that we were selling, which in turn would inform our appetite on the buy side. So now we do have a couple of dispositions that are in process. And so we are going to be looking here over the next quarter or 2 to reinvest that capital into potentially some acquisitions in the expansion regions. So we would expect -- I don't know if anything is going to close on the acquisition side in Q2, but it is our plan to kind of resume that forward trading.",

			"<strong>John Joseph Pawlowski</strong>",
			"I just wanted to follow up on the conversation around the state of the development market and the bullets you lay out on Page 11 of the investor deck. Ben, I know you threw out like a 30% to 35% reduction in land value comps. Is that representative of the market right now? And like is the volume of these broken sites meaningful right now? Or we're just getting started on the repricing?",
			"<strong>Benjamin W. Schall</strong>",
			"I think we are still early. There are more sellers than less who are actually willing to give current contracts to the time, right, extend out and see where it heads. But we are starting to see some situations where deals are breaking. <br/>And the 2 situations I was referring to had buyers who are relatively motivated. And when they're looking at on the landscape, this goes to Matt's comments about our ability to execute our -- that we don't need to rely on construction financing, right, to execute projects today, those buyers are going to own the margin, look to somebody like AvalonBay to contract to -- contract with. So that's -- yes, I'd say that's the kind of the general environment. Our expectation is that there is more to come. <br/>Starts are -- we're expecting to be down substantially this year. And a big part of underlying all of this is you look out at the private market environment and the merchant builders who have been very prolific, their ability to get capital for new construction deals is just very challenging. And the cost of that capital has also expanded out significantly, right? <br/>So on a relative basis, this is one of the parts that we're starting to see. While our cost of capital has gone up or our cost of debt borrowing has obviously gone up from the 2% range to 5% range, the private market players, if they can get construction financing, those senior mortgages are at 7.5% to 8.5% now, right? And that's before putting on some preferred equity or mezz and that's before getting to equity, right? <br/>So our relative advantage in a period like this, we think, is we're relatively well positioned. And so selectively, we're going to start stepping into some of these types of opportunities.",
			"<strong>John Joseph Pawlowski</strong>",
			"Okay. On that point, I'm just curious if you guys have any internal theories on why we haven't seen a more precipitous falloff in permitting and starts activity? I mean the credit markets have been volatile for a while, and they've been tightening for a while. And I know they're down a little bit more in your markets. But I'm just curious if you have any internal views on why we haven't seen the relief yet in the permitting starts data.",

			"Yes, John, it's Matt. It's -- I ask Craig Thomas, my Head of Market Research, that question every month when the permit numbers come out. It is a little bit of a head scratcher. I mean, I think in the fourth quarter, a lot of that was probably capital that was committed and have been lined up. And then a lot of the start -- a lot of the permit and even start activity I've come to learn is not kind of what we would think of as our product, as much of half of it is other things. Affordable housing production is actually running pretty high right now. There was a lot of onetime money through some of the COVID relief funds, which has gotten out there. So that could be inflating it a bit. But -- and in some cases, people may be pulling permits and then getting bids and not liking the numbers they're seeing.

			"I guess as you think about potential acquisition opportunities, do you think there could be some portfolios or platforms out there for acquisition? Or do you think it will be kind of singles and doubles on the land side or on the asset side?",
			"<strong>Matthew H. Birenbaum</strong>",
			"Jamie, it's Matt. I would expect, it's probably more of the latter. Usually, portfolio transactions, unless somebody has some kind of -- unless they bought a portfolio and put a lot of short-term debt on it all, which would be pretty unusual, our portfolio -- usually sellers selling portfolios, it's more opportunistic. And those things happen when there's an abundance of capital. And go back 3, 4 years, there was kind of a portfolio premium. <br/>Today, you talked about -- I think, on the last call, there's a portfolio discount just given the capital markets. So we haven't heard of anything like that and I guess I'd be a little surprised.",
			"<strong>James Colin Feldman</strong>",
			"Okay. And then as you think about the suburban versus urban assets, whether it's the April data or your views on what's to come in spring leasing, any thoughts on how they're performing versus each other and versus your expectations? And what we can see going forward -- expect going forward?",
			"<strong>Sean J. Breslin</strong>",
			"Yes, Jim, it's Sean. What I'd say is that, yes, generally, things were in line. The rent change that we experienced in Q1, that's gave out 10 basis points better than what we anticipated. And if you double click through that and look at urban and suburban, again, very, very nominal variances. Certainly, as we move forward, particularly if we get into an environment that is weaker from an economic standpoint, we do feel very good about our suburban coastal portfolio, given the exposure to new supply is quite a bit less than what we're anticipating in urban environments. So I would say, kind of as expected right now. But as you look forward, depending on how the environment unfolds, we'd probably pivot more towards suburban assets outperforming.",
			"<strong>James Colin Feldman</strong>",
			"Suburban assets outperforming?",
			"<strong>Sean J. Breslin</strong>",
			"Yes.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.",
			"<strong>John P. Kim</strong>",
			"I know you talked a little bit about Gables already, but I was wondering how big you think this revenue opportunity could be as far as offering this kind of office -- back-office support functions for other operators.",
			"<strong>Benjamin W. Schall</strong>",
			"John, yes, we haven't sized it yet at this point. We went through the pilot, as I described. We want to get to our first third-party client fully implemented. We get a little bit further out, we'll start thinking about the profile of additional clients and even further down the road, thinking about where it could come, but we're not at that stage yet.",
			"<strong>John P. Kim</strong>",
			"Okay. And where do you see the most attractive opportunities, whether it's the broken deals that you talked about in the presentation versus mezz or other ground-up developments?",
			"<strong>Benjamin W. Schall</strong>",
			"Yes. I'll hit maybe on 3 areas, and Matt can add in because he and his teams are living and breathing this. First is the development side, which we talked about. Second is on acquisitions. And this gets into -- we do think our relative trade, selling out of the established regions and into the expansion regions, is more attractive today. We've got a couple of assets now that hopefully, we will sell over the next couple of months. And so when we look to deploy that capital, the types of situations we can be looking at are could be deals in lease up, right, which are harder to finance for most buyers today; could be a place where we can bring our platform to bear for a particular reason, nearby asset. But generally, in this type of environment where we're not doing a ton of buying and selling, on the buy side, we're going to be looking for places where we can add and create some incremental yield on those acquisitions over the first couple of years. <br/>And then the third category that I'd highlight goes broadly to the theme in a world where capital is less abundant. We believe opportunities will present themselves to us, but it also makes our capital more attractive, right? So you think about our programs, the developer funding program, our structured investment program. And we look out over that book of business, and we think we have the ability, stronger sponsors, stronger quality real estate, better returns. So that's another place where we can selectively put capital to create value.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America.",
			"<strong>Joshua Dennerlein</strong>",
			"Kind of go back to the opening remarks about the development pipeline and how you don't mark to market the yield until they're impacted lease-up, does that imply that the potential uplift from the 7 projects that haven't gone into lease up yet, but will go into it later this year not included in the guidance range?",
			"<strong>Matthew H. Birenbaum</strong>",
			"Yes, this is Matt. The guidance for the year, most of those deals are going to really impact earnings in '24 and '25 because they're not going to start leasing until later this year. So we do have lease-up budgets on those deals, which is reflected in the guidance, which does reflect higher rents than kind of what's shown on the development attachment, but the real lift there isn't '23, it's '24.",
			"<strong>Joshua Dennerlein</strong>",
			"Okay. That's super helpful. And then one follow-up to that. The 70 basis uplift for the 4 recent projects you have currently with updated projections, is that a fair uplift at this point for those 7 projects?",
			"<strong>Matthew H. Birenbaum</strong>",
			"I would say that, that was kind of the point of including the slide, yes, that if the 17% uplift in rent is roughly comparable to what we've seen across our entire same-store book over that time, if that -- if those 7 lease-ups experience similar kind of rent growth to kind of what we've seen broadly over that time frame and yes, I mean, we would be expecting to see the yields on those deals rise by like roughly similar amount.",
			"<strong>Joshua Dennerlein</strong>",
			"Okay. And then you mentioned -- like if you could start a project today, you're seeing good construction pricing bids versus like a few had something that might not start for a year, you're not seeing that. What's driving that dynamic?",
			"<strong>Matthew H. Birenbaum</strong>",
			"I think it's just certainty. I mean, when you ask somebody to give you a price on a deal you're not going to start for a year, it's just -- they're just giving you an estimate number. It's not -- you can't take that number to the bank. Anyway, you don't even -- you don't have final construction drawing, so you're not contracting at that number. It's more of an allowance. And so it's natural for people to say, \"Well, here's where I did the last job at.\" When you have a job that's ready to go and it's like, \"I need your guys on site in 90 days,\" that's when some subcontractors are busy and don't need the business. <br/>And we'll give you a -- we'll not give you a number that's any better than the number they would have given you 90 days ago. But there are others where, as I said, maybe they were working on 5 jobs, they only see 2 coming up. They have availability, and they're essentially willing to lean into their margins, which got very inflated over the last couple of years when all these subcontractors were stretched beyond their capacity.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.",
			"<strong>Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste</strong>",
			"A couple of quick ones for me. I guess, first, a question on the equity that you pulled from your forward and investing with the bank at the 5%, how much is that? Can you request to withdraw it at any time at your auction? And what's the longer-term plan for that capital? Is it ultimately earmarked for development funding? Or would you also consider acquisitions or other DCP?",
			"<strong>Kevin P. O'Shea</strong>",
			"Yes, sure, Haendel. This is Kevin. Well, the amount that we pulled down the equity forward was $490 million. And so roughly speaking, that's the amount that we incrementally invested and we did so, and latter time deposits with banking partners that are very highly rated, known to us, part of our credit facility syndicate. And so -- and the latter-time deposits are essentially mapped to when we think we will be pulling that capital down or need the cash in order to reinvest into development. So that's how we've structured that set of the cash investment activity so far. So -- and we retain liquidity to fund development from that source as well as liquidity in our line of credit. So we -- of $2.25 billion, where there's nothing drawn. So we have plenty of ability to respond to new opportunities that may justify an earlier deployment of cash, either from the cash -- the cash we've invested or from our line of credit.",
			"<strong>Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste</strong>",
			"Got it. That's helpful. Ben, maybe one for you. For those of us who followed AvalonBay for some time, the recent changes you've made entering the mezz lending business delving deeper into third-party services and even a more proactive cash management strategy, capitalizing on the environment to generate some incremental FFO that you outlined, I guess I'm curious, how should we be interpreting these changes and what they suggest for Avalon's longer-term strategy as you evolve the platform. Curious what else you're considering, what else top of mind as you navigate the company forward? And then how did you think about the trade-offs for perhaps growing the revenue, but maybe adding a bit of complexity and maybe a lower multiple as well?",
			"<strong>Benjamin W. Schall</strong>",
			"Yes. I appreciate that. I'd start by emphasizing -- I mean, this is about this executive team, right? So we're the ones setting the course for this business over the coming years, and we're looking for ways to continue to drive earnings profit and ways to differentiate that we think can lead to long-term value creation. <br/>A number of the recent announcements, including the DFP and SIP, yes, there have been versions of this that have existed, elements that we are working on. And so we've decided as a team, in certain areas, where we think we can accelerate that activity. And so you've seen that come. <br/>In terms of our strategic focus areas, we've communicated this externally and continue to emphasize it internally. First is our operating model transformation and driving margin and value to customers through that. Second is optimizing our portfolio as we grow. And part of that is our movement to the expansion markets and also looking to prune assets out of our established regions. Third is leveraging our development DNA in new ways and so that gets into our programs like our DFP and our SIP. We don't talk a lot on this call, but particularly for certain investors, it matters and for associates and increasing our residents, our leadership in ESG. And then the fifth one, we always drive home, and this is what's special about here is people and culture. So that's what -- those are what are driving us as we look ahead and I believe will create outperformance for us.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.",
			"<strong>Alexander David Goldfarb</strong>",
			"So 2 questions here. First, on the expansion market, can you just remind us where you're targeting urban versus suburban? Just from some of your peers who have spoken and then speaking to the private operators in the sunbelt, it definitely seems like the supply competition is much more concentrated in the urban areas, whereas those out in the suburbs tend to be less impacted. So just sort of curious, as you look at the sunbelt, how you're framing out your exposure?",
			"<strong>Matthew H. Birenbaum</strong>",
			"Yes. Alex, it's Matt. So we don't necessarily start with a particular kind of goal in mind. Really what we're looking for is the best risk-adjusted return. And we are taking it as an opportunity in these expansion regions to construct a portfolio from the ground up. And what we found over the last couple of years as we've started our investment that we felt like the supply/demand fundamentals and the pricing of the assets was just more attractive in the suburbs. <br/>So if you look at our Denver portfolio, the assets we bought there, they've all been suburban assets. We did develop the one deal in RiNo to a very high development yield. But -- so we're going to supplement and ultimately have a diversified portfolio. But we tend to be finding better value in the suburbs, not just better supply-demand fundamentals, but also better pricing until recently, probably higher cap rates as well. <br/>So same thing in Southeast Florida. If you look at where we bought in Southeast Florida, it has tended to be more we bought in Boca. We bought in Margate. We just recently bought a couple of different assets in Broward County. So we've tended to find better value there. And we are very mindful of that as we invest. We may develop a little bit in urban areas, if we find a really strong opportunity, but a lot of our development pipeline is also suburban right now. In Denver, we have the one deal under construction in Westminster, and then we have one deal in Governors Park, which is more of an urban submarket. <br/>But these Sunbelt markets, in the first place, is not as much. They're not as urban in the first place. So I don't know that there is an urban submarket in all of Raleigh, Durham area, maybe downtown Raleigh, and we're not looking at that. So -- and in Charlotte, all of our development has been in the suburbs. We did buy the portfolio in the South which is kind of the one urban submarket there that is very, very dynamic. So I'd say that's the exception. But generally speaking, you're right, it may be a little bit of a different strategy than the way some others have pursued it. And it's also kind of just more of the way the lifestyle is in a lot of the Sunbelt metros. They just -- they don't necessarily have the same transit orientation. They don't have the concentration of employment. And a lot of the reason people are moving there is frankly to have more space and have more of that suburban lifestyle.",
			"<strong>Alexander David Goldfarb</strong>",
			"Okay. The second question is, just given what's going on in the insurance market, are you seeing more -- I don't want to say opportunity, but are you seeing that it's financially better for you to take on more self-insuring your portfolio to reduce the cost? Or maybe, especially as you partner with developers where you guys are self-insuring more, to try and mitigate some of the pretty -- the sizable premium jumps or the ability or inability to get certain carriers or reinsurers?",
			"<strong>Kevin P. O'Shea</strong>",
			"Alex, this is Kevin. Maybe I'll just respond strictly to the insurance aspects of this, and then maybe Ben or Matt may want to respond to the development implications. But you're spot on with respect to highlighting the self-insurance aspects and really the relative strength of well-capitalized REITs and particularly, residential REITs that absorb this risk as opposed to passing on to commercial tenants. So having that capability to self-insure has been a helpful thing in recent years as the insurance market has become increasingly challenging. <br/>I'm not going to get too specific about what's going on with those property renewals now, because we renew on May 15, so we're actually in the market for that. But we have, in the past, I'd say, 7 or 8 years, used our wholly-owned regulated captive insurance company in order to be strategic in these property renewals to mitigate bearing the full impact of market increases in property insurance premiums, to the extent individual insurers have become inefficient in their pricing. And so that has helped keep our insurance costs in the property program to a far lower than market rate of growth. <br/>And so for example, last year, total insurance costs, which properties have the biggest piece, grew by 4% to 5% last year. We do expect a higher level of growth this year in the property program. But as we look at this year's renewal, we're likely to be willing to take on more self-retained risk through our captive in order to mitigate inefficient pricing from some of the market participants should that be necessary.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Ami Probandt with UBS.",
			"<strong>Ami Probandt</strong>",
			"So turnover was up from the 2022 lows, but remains low on a historic basis. Wondering over the next couple of years, do you think we trend back toward a more historic level? Or has demand shifted in a way where turnover could remain below the historic level?",
			"<strong>Sean J. Breslin</strong>",
			"Ami, this is Sean. Good question. Obviously, somewhat speculative in nature in terms of what happens. I mean the one thing I would say is that we continue to remain in a relatively tight housing market overall. If you look at the sort of aggregation of multifamily, single-family, et cetera and the ability for people to access the kind of inventory they want, may be more limited, particularly on the single-family side, maybe condos, townhomes, et cetera, in the last couple of years. That does not seem to be likely to correct. <br/>So I'd say that's probably the one macro factor that may put some cap on sort of churn and people that would typically 13%, 14%, 15% that might go buy a home, this past quarter, that was less than 10%. And that's not likely to get better in the near term given the financing market, but also just the production in terms of what's actually being put on the ground. So that's one factor that may kind of keep a lid on things here for the next several quarters.",
			"<strong>Ami Probandt</strong>",
			"Okay. Great. And then another quick one. How do yields on the projects and the developer funding program compare with AvalonBay development yields?",
			"<strong>Matthew H. Birenbaum</strong>",
			"Ami, this is Matt. They are -- the way we think about that program is basically we're allocating the risk differently than on our own development. And so consequently the target returns are also allocated differently. Our target is for the yield to be roughly halfway between an acquisition and a development. What we found so far, and the few we've done is that it's been higher than that. So the way I would think about it is the yield on those deals is probably going to be 30, 40 basis points less than the yield on if we've done the development ourselves, but still probably at least 50, 60 basis points north of where an acquisition yield would be, if not more.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays.",
			"<strong>Anthony Franklin Powell</strong>",
			"Broader question, I guess, on the Governor of New York's housing proposal that is stalled now in the Senate and the House there, that would have expanded zoning for multifamily in the suburbs. Was that an opportunity for you to develop? Or was that more supply? And how do you view those kinds of, I guess, initiatives nationwide going forward?",
			"<strong>Matthew H. Birenbaum</strong>",
			"I would have -- this is Matt. I think -- and Ben and Sean may want to weigh in as well. It's really interesting to see these states try to engage in that dialogue about. But one of the things that has really led to the supply constraints that have in turn led to really an underproduction of housing has been local control. And that is a bit of a third rail politically in California, in New York and other states. So it's interesting to see the state legislatures try to chip away at it. <br/>I think you're right, it's both, right? It would be an opportunity for us as a developer. If it was really effective in the long run, it might lower the long-term rent growth trajectory of some of those markets. Frankly, from a public policy point of view, that's kind of would be the point of it. What we've seen so far, at least in California, has been every time there's been something that, in theory, would have opened up more sites to development, there's been something else on the other side that's come with it that has made it a bit of a poison pill. <br/>So it has been very difficult to actually effectuate. They say they'll allow multifamily in your transit, but then they're saying it has to be prevailing wage, construction cost, which is a 20%, 30% premium and so economically, it doesn't work. Or they'll open it up in certain sites, but they need 20%, 25% affordable. And again, you can't afford the going price for land and make that economics work. <br/>So the one place we've seen it truly be effective so far has been with the smaller program in California, the ADU accessory dwelling unit. We actually have over 100 of those currently in our pipeline, where we can just add 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 apartments in kind of underutilized storage or parking areas at existing communities and not have to go through zoning process. So that's not going to move the needle kind of on the prominent macro level, but that's one small program we have been able to take advantage of.",
			"<strong>Benjamin W. Schall</strong>",
			"And then maybe just to add kind of -- yes, the higher level regulatory dynamics are influencing our portfolio allocation decisions. It's been a part of the reason why over the last number of years, we've been moving more and more to a suburban-oriented portfolio. And if you see where we're allocating capital, we're 2/3 suburban today, probably headed towards [3/4] there. It's influenced our move to the expansion regions, right, at a minimum to diversify away from regulatory environments. And then the reality is, at a more local level based on some of the steps of certain municipalities and effectively, the bar is higher for allocating new capital there and it's playing into how we're shifting capital around our portfolio and within our regions.",

			"<strong>Robert E. Sulentic</strong>",
			"Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results were slightly better than we expected going into the year, but still down significantly from last year's strong first quarter. Our performance relative to our expectations was led by the cyclically resilient elements of our business and our cost management efforts, which more than offset a greater-than-expected decline in property sales. The elements of our business that are cyclically resilient include our entire GWS business, loan servicing, property management, valuations and asset management fees from our investment management business. Combined, these businesses saw revenue increase nearly 10% during the first quarter and are expected to account for more than 50% of our business segment operating profit for the year, a record high. With this increased diversification, our business is more resilient, but current conditions are difficult for capital markets and getting more difficult for leasing.<br/>There are three major reasons for these difficulties. First, inflation, elevated interest rates and the likelihood of a recession. Second, banking system stress and third, issue specific to the return to office and office utilization. I'll address each of these. We are aligned with the consensus view that the economy will tip into a recession later this year. We believe it will be a moderate recession and that an eventual easing of the Fed's monetary policy will spur a rebound in economic activity in 2024. The comments Emma and I make today and our responses to questions will be shaped by that view. The high-profile regional bank failures last month have further constrained lending. However, we are not in another global financial crisis when all debt capital source is contracted simultaneously.<br/>Regional banks are still lending to commercial real estate but on a much more selective basis. We expect the regional bank pullback to be partly offset by other capital sources, including the GSEs, debt funds and private capital sources. Looking at the office market, we estimate it will take this asset class twice as long to recover the lost value as it did in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. This reflects the formidable challenges facing office assets, driven by both the slow progress employees return to office and the shedding of jobs in tech and other sectors. Ultimately, we believe that office portfolios will shrink meaningfully from where they were prior to the pandemic, making offices a smaller but still very large commercial real estate asset class.<br/>Even with these legitimate concerns in line, we believe sentiment has deteriorated more than the fundamentals that underpin our business. This pattern is typical with commercial real estate investors and occupiers, becoming overly bearish in anticipation of and during early stages of a down cycle. It is our view that debt cost and cap rates are likely near their peak and should gradually improve starting later this year, driving a turnaround that will significantly impact 2024 performance. To expand on my earlier remarks regarding the growing resilience in our business, our Global Workplace Solutions segment, which generated more than $900 million of segment operating profit over the past 12 months, is expected to grow by double digits this year. In total, our cyclically resilient business lines, including GWS, produced approximately $1.5 billion of segment operating profit over the past 12 months and we expect them to grow in aggregate by high single digits this year.<br/>It's also important to note that we have become much less dependent on office properties, which accounted for just 14% of U.S. property sales revenue in 2022. Other asset classes where we have large businesses will be more resilient. For instance, we expect valuations for industrial and multifamily to fully recover in 2 to 3 years, less than half the time it took coming out of the global financial crisis. Although we anticipate pressure on our transactional businesses to intensify further this year, we are maintaining our earnings outlook for full year 2023.<br/>Emma will discuss this in detail during her remarks. Emma?",
			"<strong>Emma E. Giamartino</strong>",
			"Thank you, Bob. As Bob mentioned, the diversification of our business and rigorous financial discipline were key to producing Q1 results that were slightly better than the expectations we set forth for each of our segments in late February, despite some market environment becoming more challenging. I'll review each segment now, starting with Advisory Services on Slide 6.<br/>Results in the first quarter were supported by stability in our valuations, loan servicing and property management lines of business, with revenue relatively flat compared to prior year. We also benefited from cost mitigation efforts, we initiated last year that decreased advisory operating expenses by 2.5%. So these benefits were offset by a greater decline in our property sales business than expected. Capital markets, property sales and loan origination combined declined 40%, a slightly greater decline than expectations. Within property sales, all major reasons saw revenue decline with Asia Pacific performing the best, down 30%, and the Americas falling more than 40%. Most sales activity today involves industrial and multifamily (inaudible) with office understandably drawing little capital activity.<br/>Significant capital is ready to be deployed, but we do not expect activity to improve until borrowing costs decline and market pricing clarity improved. Leasing revenue declined 8%, in line with expectations against the nearly 50% increase in the first quarter last year. Across geographies, leasing performance diverged, with the Americas down 10% and EMEA down 5% and APAC up 26%, all in local currency. This is consistent with our expectations for non-U.S. markets, especially APAC, to perform relatively better in light of regional economic outlooks and improved office utilization levels.<br/>Now please turn to Slide 7. Our GWS business continues to grow impressively with both facilities management and project management net revenue up by double digits, exceeding our expectations. Growth was driven by several of the large facilities management contract wins achieved last year and strong organic growth within project management, driven by large project mandates. Our pipeline of new business reached a record level at the end of the first quarter as both existing clients and first-generation outsourcers are increasingly focused on cost reduction. GWS's margin on net revenue of 10.8% was in line with our expectations and will improve throughout the year as our cost reduction efforts to phase in.<br/>Please turn to Slide 8. Overall, REI results met our expectations, and we continue to expect full year results to meet our original guidance. Q1 development results were supported by large asset sales, which occurred in January, consistent with what we discussed last quarter. For the balance of the year, we expect our asset sales to be heavily weighted to industrial projects such as monetized in the fourth quarter. We have pulled back only slightly on planned construction starts for 2023. We do anticipate that well-conceived projects we got in the current environment will come online in supply-constrained markets, most notably for industrial. For the same reason, we are focused on carefully building our land position so that we can benefit from [a] first-mover advantage coming out of the downturn, a position that has historically provided significant rewards. Additionally, our Telford U.K. development business is tracking in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect improvement from 2022 results. <br/>Within Investment Management, profit was roughly flat versus prior year, excluding the mark-to-market impact on our co-investment portfolio, which was a significant positive in the prior year. For context, co-investment gains made up less than 1% of this business line's operating profit in the trailing 12 months. AUM declined modestly from the fourth quarter as net capital inflows and foreign currency effects offset most of the loss of market value.<br/>Turning to Slide 9. We believe the current environment is an attractive time to deploy capital. Our M&amp;A pipeline is strong with multiple attractive opportunities, some large that could transform CBRE's existing offerings and drive meaningful shareholder value. We reduced share repurchases in the quarter as we continue to evaluate these opportunities. If we are unable to convert our larger pursuits we will accelerate our share repurchase activity well above Q1 levels. In any event, we expect to deploy more capital in the next 12 months than in the prior 12 months while maintaining an appropriately conservative level of leverage. We expect to generate in excess of $1 billion of free cash flow this year. When combining this expected free cash flow with our lightly levered balance sheet, we could invest as much as $5.5 billion this year, while maintaining leverage below 2 turns.<br/>I'll conclude with our outlook. Our original 2023 outlook contemplated our recovery from the current downturn in the back half of the year. We now expect a delayed recovery due to more constrained debt liquidity and heightened market uncertainties. Our sales and leasing businesses are most impacted by the changed economic environment. And as a result, we now anticipate property sales to fall by nearly 20%, which would represent a more than 25% decline from peak 2021 levels. We also expect leasing activity to be down by high single digits this year. As Bob indicated, we are maintaining our full year outlook, with core earnings per share expected to decline by low- to mid-double digits this year. <br/>Stronger growth than we originally anticipated in our resilient lines of business described earlier and incremental cost reduction efforts will largely offset the impact of our weaker outlook for capital markets and leasing transactions. However, there is more uncertainty in this outlook than there was when we first presented it in late February. We continue to expect core EPS to exceed the prior peak in 2024. And as a reminder, our outlook is informed by our view that there will be a moderate recession this year, followed by a rebound in economic activity in 2024 as the Fed reduces interest rates.<br/>With that, operator, we'll open the line for questions.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs.",
			"<strong>Chandni Luthra</strong>",
			"I would like to talk about capital allocation first. So what are the segments that are most attractive to you from an M&amp;A standpoint. Bob, Emma, could you give us a sense of multiples and perhaps size of the deal, say, with respect to Turner &amp; Townsend, which was one of the biggest deals you've done in recent past. And help us understand if are looking at one large transformative deal? Or is it going to be a cocktail of smaller M&amp;A transactions.",
			"<strong>Emma E. Giamartino</strong>",
			"Yes, Chandni, so we are looking for opportunities across our segments where we can enhance the offerings that we currently have. And we are looking at multiple deals that are larger than what we've typically done. So on the larger side of both Turner &amp; Townsend. And in terms of the segments that we're focused on, it's facilities management, it's investment management, and it's our resilient lines of business within advisory such as valuation. So we're looking across all 3 segments, and we are looking for, when we say transformational, it's needle moving something that can change the profile of our existing businesses. These aren't businesses that are completely new to CBRE. <br/>We have extremely [rating] standards. As you can imagine, you asked about multiple across those three segments. The multiples are different, but we are looking for highly accretive deals that can generate returns and shareholder value well above what we could do with buybacks alone. And I do want to underscore that M&amp;A can move in multiple directions, and we are hopeful that we'll convert at least a large deal in our pipeline. But if we don't do that, we will accelerate our share repurchases. And as I said in my remarks, we intend to deploy as much capital as we -- in the next 12 months as we did in the last 12 months. And as a reminder, that was just over $2 billion of capital deployed.",
			"<strong>Chandni Luthra</strong>",
			"And a quick follow-up to that. As you think about 2023 guidance, there is M&amp;A part of this unchanged guidance?",
			"<strong>Emma E. Giamartino</strong>",
			"It is not. It is not. And what I'd say about that is both buybacks and M&amp;A done towards the end of the year will not have a meaningful impact to 2023 results. That impact will flow into 2024.",
			"<strong>Chandni Luthra</strong>",
			"Got it. And then for my second question, you obviously cut set guidance for transactions and leasing, but you maintained your EPS guidance for 2023 and also sort of 2024. So give us your thought process behind this comfort, like how much of this unchanged EPS guidance is from noncyclical components performing better versus you leaning into more cost cuts in the business? And what are those incremental cost reduction efforts that you're now contemplating that you perhaps weren't when you printed 4Q results and the world was a little bit.",
			"<strong>Emma E. Giamartino</strong>",
			"So Chandni, that's actually a really important question. I'd say, high level, the reduction from our revised (inaudible) [ground] sales and leasing revenue is having about a 3% impact to our far outlook for EPS for the full year, and that is being offset by a combination of higher growth in GWS and cost mitigation efforts or cost avoidance efforts in REI and advisory.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Now our question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.",
			"<strong>Stephen Thomas Sakwa</strong>",
			"Bob, Emma, I guess, could you just talk a little bit about the transaction business. And I'm just curious, Bob, is it -- do you think the absolute rates is for being 5% plus a spread that's putting borrowing costs in the in that's creating it? Or do you think it's more the availability of credit today that's creating an issue in the transaction market.",
			"<strong>Robert E. Sulentic</strong>",
			"Steve, it's both of those things. It's the absolute rates, it's the availability of credit, but it's a third thing, and that is the uncertainty about where things are going to go. And we think later this year, all three of those things will start to move in a direction that's helpful to our business. We think rates will stabilize, possibly come down more capital more debt and equity will become available. And the combination of those two things will create more certainty around pricing, and we think that transactions will start to happen again on the capital market side.",
			"<strong>Stephen Thomas Sakwa</strong>",
			"Okay. And I don't remember if it was the last quarter or maybe the quarter before. I know you had sort of talked about a longer range EPS target, I think, in the $8 to $9 range. And I believe that time frame had been pushed out maybe more like the '26 or '27 from maybe that was originally '25. I'm just curious, as you look out over the next, say, 3 to 5 years, how do you sort of think about that $8 to $9 figure? And is that time frame of '26, '27 still realistic?",
			"<strong>Robert E. Sulentic</strong>",
			"We talked about that at the end of the year, which, by the way, that was only 60 days ago, roughly. And our long-term view is not altered by what we've seen so far this year. Of course, we'll address that again next year when we have the benefit of the full year view. But our long-term view for the prospects of the business are good. And of course, part of those -- the long term is the short term, I will say what we've seen in the short term is challenged in one sense, the transactions, but in the other sense, our enthusiasm for and belief in these -- what we're calling these resilient businesses, particularly GWS. And also what we're seeing in the M&amp;A space where we have become a more interesting buyer to a good number of companies than we have been historically. <br/>There are companies out there in our sector or directly adjacent to our sector that believe by becoming part of our business or having financial sponsorship from our business will help them perform better than they could perform on their own. And this is not a circumstance that's going on in the same way with other companies in our sector. We think we have a distinct advantage there. And that's going to be a more material part of our future, we believe now that you would have heard from us certainly in the past.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question is from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan.",
			"<strong>Anthony Paolone</strong>",
			"And I guess the first one for you, Bob, just on this capital allocation, M&amp;A and just where the business is going to that point, if you look out 2 or 3 years, where do you think the biggest shift in revenue mix is for you all? Do you think it's by property type, geography or business line? Just any thoughts on how to think about that?",
			"<strong>Robert E. Sulentic</strong>",
			"Well, there'll be shifts across all of those. So by geography, our business is definitively becoming larger on a relative basis in Asia Pacific, Asia specifically than it has been historically. I'll give you an example. In the advisory business, forever, our second biggest business was the U.K. behind the United States, and there wasn't anything close. Our business in Japan now is roughly the same size as our business in the U.K. For sure, we're growing our businesses related to the multifamily and industrial asset classes. We're not the only ones doing that, but that's a definitive part of what we're doing. <br/>And then the outsourcing business, which includes us providing facilities management and project management and portfolio services work, mostly for big corporates focused on saving them money, working on their net zero initiatives, shedding assets in some cases. That business will be an enduring double-digit grower and probably not low double digits. We think there's an opportunity to have that be mid-double digits. And when I made my comments a minute ago about companies being increasingly interested in having us be their acquirer or us investing in them, a lot of that happens in that segment. So that's kind of where we see the shift happening across our businesses.",
			"<strong>Anthony Paolone</strong>",
			"Okay. And then just on the leasing side, you noted just the step down that's unfolding there. I think the office side of it, I think everybody probably understands pretty well. But do you see any other parts of leasing cracking either geographically or by property type that's of note, like industrial has been pretty strong, but maybe a little bit more color there. And I think even like retail in Europe, you called it out and I think your release as having been pretty good.",
			"<strong>Robert E. Sulentic</strong>",
			"Yes, retail leasing is good. And by the way, retail rental rates are growing up because there's a big experience thing going on here across the U.S. and around the world that is causing retailers of various types, including food and beverage. But obviously, the high-end retailers doing quite well, and that's helping our leasing business in retail. Industrial's been white hot over the last couple of years, and it's just not going to stay that hot indefinitely. That's been a little bit anomalistic. And so we are seeing a little bit of downward pressure on industrial leasing. But we think over the longer term, industrial leasing will be very, very strong. And the dynamics driving logistics space around the world will remain in place. But we are seeing some downward pressure on that for sure this year.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question is from Jade Rahmani with KBW.",
			"<strong>Jade Joseph Rahmani</strong>",
			"On commercial real estate as an asset class, we're at an interesting time because for as long as I've covered the space, the institutional allocation to commercial real estate has continually increased, and this is the first year, as I remember, where it's decreasing. And at the same time, the ground is clearly shifting with office, and office historically represents a scaled way to deploy capital in the space. Otherwise, you're buying very small assets. It's very hard to get to scale. So do any of those dynamics affect in your view the long-term secular trend of institutionalization in commercial real estate and the attractiveness of the asset class overall.",
			"<strong>Robert E. Sulentic</strong>",
			"In aggregate, Jade, I don't think so. And I'll tell you why I say that. First of all, what you're seeing now isn't driven largely by commercial real estate being out of favor. It's not even in the biggest sense being driven by office buildings being out of favor. It's being driven by the denominator effect. The base of assets around the world is growing. The base of industrial space around the world is growing. The base of institutional quality multifamily around the world is growing, et cetera. And we think that's going to continue. And we think when stock prices rebound, the denominator effect will go in the other direction. The other thing I would tell you about office space, which has been a big home for capital, there's a tendency when things turn to think that they're going to turn and disappear. <br/>Our view is that the portfolios that companies have [in] the office space, not the investors in office space, but the companies that use it that ultimately drive the investment in office space will shrink materially. But it will still be an enormous asset class. If it's down 20% or 10% or 15%, whatever it settles down, it will still be an enormous asset class. And the future of office space is still being sorted out. We may be more back in the office in the future than we are today. That's just an unknown. But that will be a very large asset class. That will be a very big home for institutional capital in the future, but certainly, other asset classes will and there's all retail and industrial, hotels, multifamily, huge asset classes and look what's going on with hotels. I mean try to get a hotel room at a rational pre-COVID rate right now anywhere in a good hotel and that you just can't do it. And so I don't think commercial real estate as an asset class is going to decline in importance at all in the future.",
			"<strong>Jade Joseph Rahmani</strong>",
			"I wanted to ask about this. Again, I don't know if it's a pipe dream I have, but I could envision CBRE going in a direction where infrastructure really becomes essentially a new leg in the stool, a new stand-alone segment and you really broaden the suite of services you provide to governments, to agencies and client mitigation becomes an extremely large strategic opportunity. So do you see infrastructure as one of those potential transformational type deals, it probably also would be accretive to CBRE's overall multiples since we've enhanced resiliency that sector being less cyclical and having a lot of secular growth potential.",
			"<strong>Robert E. Sulentic</strong>",
			"Jade, there's two areas of our business now where we do meaningful work in infrastructure. We have an investment management business that invests in infrastructure. And with the acquisition of 60% of Turner &amp; Townsend, which by the way, has continued to outperform our expectations. They have a significant infrastructure and significant green energy business, and they do large projects subject to very long-term contracts around the world. We would expect those businesses to grow and provide incremental opportunity to us in the long run. What we might do beyond that is a long run circumstance that we're not really prepared to talk about at this point, but we do have positive exposure in both those areas.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question is from Michael Griffin with Citi.",
			"<strong>Michael Anderson Griffin</strong>",
			"Bob, I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about how you expect GWS to grow in the high single digits. I think last quarter, it was [pegged] at about low double digits. Maybe I misheard this, but if that's the case, why would that be? I presume that these are sort of stickier, more resilient business lines. So anything you could add on that would be great.",
			"<strong>Robert E. Sulentic</strong>",
			"Yes, Michael. What I said was that we expect the total of our cyclically resilient business is to grow in the high single digits. So that would be GWS valuations, property management the fee portion of our investment management business, we expect our GWS business to grow well into the double digits.",
			"<strong>Michael Anderson Griffin</strong>",
			"Got you. That's helpful. And then maybe just one on office, particularly on potential refinancings and debt coming due. I think we've seen some news recently about some debt availability for maybe less than trophy class properties. And I think library office asset [need] might suggest at least a data point that I saw that there is debt out there. Are you seeing this particularly on the office side? I mean I think the expectation is for trophy buildings to have financing, but maybe some of that not the absolute [top of] the market stuff might be harder to finance.",
			"<strong>Robert E. Sulentic</strong>",
			"Yes. Well, trophy buildings both in the current environment and in the long term are going to do quite well in our view. Because with all that's going on, on the return to the office circumstance, companies are looking for great environments for their employees. We're doing it for our own headquarters in our own offices around the U.S. and around the world. Virtually, all of our clients are doing it. And these -- so these great buildings are going to do well. B and C buildings are going to be challenged, and there is less capital available for them. But I think there's an overreaction to that circumstance. The press -- it's like so many things. It's a great story to talk about how (inaudible) something is when it gets (inaudible) the fact of the matter is, coming out of the financial crisis, office buildings were capitalized much more conservatively than they had been historically, more equity in office buildings than there had been previously.<br/>If you look at the banking system today, something like 1.5% of commercial or commercial banks asset portfolio is in office buildings. It's not a huge threatening circumstance. Some of the problem assets will go back to the bank. Some of them will get restructured and worked out as is always the case with troubled assets. So it's going to be hard to refinance some of those assets and some of those assets are going to become troubled and go back. But it's not going to be an overwhelming circumstance the way certain headlines would suggest it might be.",
			"<strong>Michael Anderson Griffin</strong>",
			"Great. That's helpful. And then just last one. I think Emma might have mentioned the Telford acquisition tracking in line with expectations. The U.K., I believe it's a single-family business. Obviously, we've seen over here in the states, worries around the regulatory front and maybe some single-family companies. Is there any worry that similar regulations could come down the pipe in the U.K.? Or is it just kind of a very different business model.",
			"<strong>Emma E. Giamartino</strong>",
			"Michael, I just want to clarify, our Telford business is a multifamily business, it's shifting towards build-to-rent multifamily.",
			"<strong>Michael Anderson Griffin</strong>",
			"Okay. And is there any way around regulation on that? I mean we've seen some of the apartment companies, whether it's rent regulation, stuff like that, any concerns?",
			"<strong>Emma E. Giamartino</strong>",
			"No, no. We don't have any concerns. And we actually see -- when we initially made that investment, we saw a secular tailwind in [builder] in the U.K. that continues to exist. And so we expect that business to continue to grow going forward.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question is from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair.",
			"<strong>Stephen Hardy Sheldon</strong>",
			"Really impressive trends. GWS this quarter sounds like there is confidence in continued double-digit growth there. In that context, I think there has been at least some concern that with companies reducing their office real estate footprint that it could become a headwind to growth in GWS at some point if contract scopes get reduced. So be curious if you're concerned about that at all? Or is the business so diversified by different asset classes and the industry still so fragmented and so early in outsourcing adoption that you're not worried about the growth trajectory at GWS over the medium term. I guess how do you think about that?",
			"<strong>Robert E. Sulentic</strong>",
			"Stephen, corporates reducing their office footprint is a headwind for that business. And by the way, has been a headwind for that business for the last 15 years. The average square foot per person that [corporates] use has been going down and down and down and we've been helping them with that. We've been helping them reconfigure their portfolios. We've been helping them do project work in support of that. And the project work they need now with the kind of space they're trying to deliver for their employees is really important. So yes, that will be a headwind in terms of the amount of space that we might manage for individual corporates. But other work we would do for them will offset that. <br/>But the thing kind of overwhelms that circumstance is that more corporates are bringing us on new clients are bringing us on to help them create environments for their employees to help them save money, both in terms of the size of their footprint, the operation of their facilities to help them move toward a more energy-efficient environment and certainly now with Turner &amp; Townsend, that puts us in a better place to do that. So the net of all those dynamics is that this is going to be a double-digit growing business. And again, that's before some of the acquisition opportunities that we're seeing that are becoming more prominent for us because -- partly because we want to do it, but partly because companies that might combine with us are finding us more interesting than they used to.",
			"<strong>Stephen Hardy Sheldon</strong>",
			"Very helpful. And then just a follow-up. You've given some good detail on the 2024 kind of commentary. But on 2024 core EPS surpassing the prior peak, which is 2022. Is the planned capital deployment a big factor in that, whether it's accretive M&amp;A or share repurchase activity? Or would you still expect to surpass prior peak in 2024 without a big ramp in capital deployment?",
			"<strong>Emma E. Giamartino</strong>",
			"There's very little capital deployment in that plan to exceed prior peak EPS in 2024. Any capital allocation buybacks and M&amp;A would help us surpass that even to a greater extent. And I do want to emphasize that getting to 2024 -- in 2024 getting to that record EPS level, we believe it is very achievable. It takes relatively conservative assumptions to get there for both a rebound in our advisory and our transactional business lines, both in REI and advisory. We don't have to get back to 2021 levels in those businesses to get to the direct EPS. And then within GWS. If you are in the very low double-digit range, we can still get to that record EPS level. And that again, that's all without meaningful capital allocation.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question is from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.",
			"<strong>Patrick Joseph O'Shaughnessy</strong>",
			"So obviously, debt financing is really challenging right now in commercial real estate. What sort of role do you see for private credit in commercial real estate financing going forward?",
			"<strong>Robert E. Sulentic</strong>",
			"Well, I can tell you, Patrick, it won't be surprising to you to hear me say that we interface a lot with the private equity folks in commercial real estate who are customers of ours that might be participants in this. And the view is that this is going to be a big opportunity for them. When there's a lack of supply coming from other areas, people come in and backfill and create opportunities for themselves in that area, and we think that's going to happen here.",
			"<strong>Patrick Joseph O'Shaughnessy</strong>",
			"Got it. And then you spoke earlier about market pricing clarity serving as a catalyst for improved capital markets transactions. But what's the catalyst for that market pricing clarity to actually happen?",
			"<strong>Robert E. Sulentic</strong>",
			"Interest rates to stabilize and come down are the biggest factor there, and we think that's going to happen later this year.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"There are no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the floor back over to Bob Sulentic for any closing comments.",
			"<strong>Robert E. Sulentic</strong>",
			"Thanks, everyone, for joining us, and we look forward to talking to you again a quarter from now when we report our second quarter results.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",

This includes, for example, external growth factors, such as dispositions, and balance sheet items, such as debt issuances, that have not yet occurred, are out of the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information.

			"<b><u>Definitions</u></b>",
			"<b><u>Funds From Operations (FFO):<br/></u></b>",
			"We calculate funds from operations, or FFO, in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or Nareit, in the Nareit Funds From Operations White Paper - 2018 Restatement. FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from real estate transactions, impairment of investment in real estate, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), unconsolidated JV real estate related depreciation &amp; amortization, non-controlling interests in operating partnership and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our data centers that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our data centers, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our financial condition and results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Other REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to other REITs' FFO. FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.",
			"<b><u>Core Funds from Operations (Core FFO)</u></b><b>:</b>",
			"We present core funds from operations, or Core FFO, as a supplemental operating measure because, in excluding certain items that do not reflect core revenue or expense streams, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in our core business operating performance. We calculate Core FFO by adding to or subtracting from FFO (i) other non-core revenue adjustments, (ii) transaction and integration expenses, (iii) loss from early extinguishment of debt, (iv) gain on / issuance costs associated with redeemed preferred stock, (v) severance, equity acceleration, and legal expenses, (vi) gain/loss on FX revaluation, and (vii) other non-core expense adjustments. Because certain of these adjustments have a real economic impact on our financial condition and results from operations, the utility of Core FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. Other REITs may calculate Core FFO differently than we do and accordingly, our Core FFO may not be comparable to other REITs' Core FFO. Core FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.",
			"<b><u>Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO)</u></b><b>:</b>",
			"We present adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, as a supplemental operating measure because, when compared year over year, it assesses our ability to fund dividend and distribution requirements from our operating activities. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the operations of REITs, AFFO will be used by investors as a basis to assess our ability to fund dividend payments in comparison to other REITs, including on a per share and unit basis. We calculate AFFO by adding to or subtracting from Core FFO (i) non-real estate depreciation, (ii) amortization of deferred financing costs, (iii) amortization of debt discount/premium, (iv) non-cash stock-based compensation expense, (v) straight-line rental revenue, (vi) straight-line rental expense, (vii) above- and below-market rent amortization, (viii) deferred tax expense / (benefit), (ix) leasing compensation and internal lease commissions, and (x) recurring capital expenditures. Other REITs may calculate AFFO differently than we do and, accordingly, our AFFO may not be comparable to other REITs' AFFO. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.",
			"<b><u>EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA</u></b><b>:</b>",
			"We believe that earnings before interest, loss from early extinguishment of debt, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), are useful supplemental performance measures because they allow investors to view our performance without the impact of non-cash depreciation and amortization or the cost of debt and, with respect to Adjusted EBITDA, unconsolidated joint venture real estate related depreciation &amp; amortization, unconsolidated joint venture interest expense and tax, severance, equity acceleration, and legal expenses, transaction and integration expenses, gain on sale / deconsolidation, impairment of investments in real estate, other non-core adjustments, net, non-controlling interests, preferred stock dividends, including undeclared dividends, and issuance costs associated with redeemed preferred stock. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA excluding unconsolidated joint venture real estate related depreciation &amp; amortization, unconsolidated joint venture interest expense and tax, severance, equity acceleration, and legal expenses, transaction and integration expenses, gain on sale / deconsolidation, impairment of investments in real estate, other non-core adjustments, net, non-controlling interests, preferred stock dividends, including undeclared dividends, and gain on / issuance costs associated with redeemed preferred stock. In addition, we believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are calculated before recurring cash charges including interest expense and income taxes, exclude capitalized costs, such as leasing commissions, and are not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements of our business, their utility as a measure of our performance is limited. Other REITs may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do and, accordingly, our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other REITs' EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Accordingly, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as supplements to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our financial performance.",
			"<b><u>Net Operating Income (NOI) and Cash NOI</u></b><b>:</b>",
			"Net operating income, or NOI, represents rental revenue, tenant reimbursement revenue and interconnection revenue less utilities expense, rental property operating expenses, property taxes and insurance expenses (as reflected in the statement of operations). NOI is commonly used by stockholders, company management and industry analysts as a measurement of operating performance of the company's rental portfolio. Cash NOI is NOI less straight-line rents and above- and below-market rent amortization. Cash NOI is commonly used by stockholders, company management and industry analysts as a measure of property operating performance on a cash basis. However, because NOI and cash NOI exclude depreciation and amortization and capture neither the changes in the value of our data centers that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our data centers, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of NOI and cash NOI as measures of our performance is limited. Other REITs may calculate NOI and cash NOI differently than we do and, accordingly, our NOI and cash NOI may not be comparable to other REITs' NOI and cash NOI. NOI and cash NOI should be considered only as supplements to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as measures of our performance.",
			"<b><u>Additional Definitions</u></b>",
			"Net debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio is calculated as total debt at balance sheet carrying value, plus capital lease obligations, plus Digital Realty's pro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture debt, less cash and cash equivalents (including Digital Realty's pro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture cash) divided by the product of Adjusted EBITDA (including Digital Realty's pro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture EBITDA), multiplied by four.",
			"Debt-plus-preferred-to-total enterprise value is mortgage debt and other loans plus preferred stock divided by mortgage debt and other loans plus the liquidation value of preferred stock and the market value of outstanding Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock and Digital Realty Trust, L.P. units, assuming the redemption of Digital Realty Trust, L.P. units for shares of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. common stock.",
			"Fixed charge coverage ratio is Adjusted EBITDA divided by the sum of GAAP interest expense, capitalized interest, scheduled debt principal payments and preferred dividends. For the quarter ended <span class=\"xn-chron\">March 31, 2023</span>, GAAP interest expense was $102 million, capitalized interest was <span class=\"xn-money\">$27 million</span> and scheduled debt principal payments and preferred dividends was <span class=\"xn-money\">$10 million</span>.",

Such forward-looking statements include statements relating to: our economic outlook, our expected investment and expansion activity, anticipated continued demand for our products and service, our liquidity, our joint ventures, supply and demand for data center and colocation space, our acquisition and disposition activity, pricing and net effective leasing economics, market dynamics and data center fundamentals, our strategic priorities, our product offerings, available inventory, rent from leases that have been signed but have not yet commenced and other contracted rent to be received in future periods, rental rates on future leases, lag between signing and commencement, cap rates and yields, investment activity, the company's FFO, Core FFO, constant currency Core FFO, adjusted FFO, and net income, 2023 outlook and underlying assumptions, information related to trends, our strategy and plans, leasing expectations, weighted average lease terms, the exercise of lease extensions, lease expirations, debt maturities, annualized rent at expiration of leases, the effect new leases and increases in rental rates will have on our rental revenue, our credit ratings, construction and development activity and plans, projected construction costs, estimated yields on investment, expected occupancy, expected square footage and IT load capacity upon completion of development projects, backlog NOI, NAV components, and other forward-looking financial data.

			"<strong>CBRE Group Inc.</strong>’s CBRE first-quarter 2023 core earnings per share (EPS) of 92 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents. Quarterly revenues of $7.41 billion also compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.30 billion. Shares of CBRE have risen more than 6% so far.<br/><br/>However, on a year-over-year basis, the core EPS declined by 34%. Revenues managed to increase 1.1%. Despite the challenging macro environment, CBRE Group benefited from the diversification across asset types, business lines, client types and geographies and the expansion of its resilient business in recent years, as well as cost-containment efforts.<br/><br/>Net revenues decreased 4.5% (1.2% in local currency) year over year to $4.18 billion. Core EBITDA declined 27.2% (25.1% in local currency) to $533 million.<br/><br/>In the first quarter of 2023, CBRE completed five in-fill acquisitions for a total of $65 million in cash and deferred consideration. These included four in the GWS business.<br/><br/>According to Bob Sulentic, CBRE’s president and chief executive officer, “Although we anticipate pressure on our transactional businesses to intensify further this year, we are maintaining our earnings outlook for full-year 2023, with core earnings per share expected to decline by low-to-mid double digits this year, but then exceed the prior peak in 2024.”",
			"CBRE Group’s Advisory Services segment reported a year-over-year revenue decrease of 17.5% (15.1% in local currency) to $1.85 billion. Global leasing revenues fell 8% (6% in local currency), reflecting declines across all major property types, except retail. This decrease was driven by the Americas, where revenues fell 10% (same in local currency). Moreover, foreign currency headwinds shrouded growth in overseas markets.<br/><br/>Global sales revenues fell 41% (38% in local currency) amid much-constrained capital availability and difficult comparisons with the first quarter of 2022. Global mortgage origination revenues declined 51% (same in local currency) as most debt capital sources abruptly curbed their lending activity.<br/><br/>The Global Workplace Solutions (“GWS”) segment registered a year-over-year increase of 11.1% (14.8% in local currency) in revenues to $5.3 billion. Encouragingly, GWS experienced its strongest first quarter for new business since 2019, and the pipeline too rose to a record level, with growth across almost all major client sectors.<br/><br/>With significant growth in technology and healthcare clients, Facilities management net revenues increased 12% (16% local currency). Also, due to large project mandates, Project management net revenues rose 18% (23% local currency).<br/><br/>The Real Estate Investments segment experienced a decline of 21.1% (17% in local currency) in revenues to $224 million. At the end of the first quarter of 2023, assets under management decreased by $0.4 billion from year-end 2022 to $148.9 billion, reflecting lower asset values, which offset net capital inflows and a positive currency movement.",
			"CBRE Group exited the first quarter of 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $1.23 billion, down from $1.32 billion as of Dec 31, 2022.<br/><br/>As of Mar 31, 2023, CBRE Group had $3.7 billion in total liquidity. This comprised $1.2 billion in cash in addition to the ability to borrow a total of $2.5 billion under its revolving credit facilities, net of any outstanding letters of credit. The company’s net leverage ratio was 0.56 as of the same date, significantly less than CBRE’s primary debt covenant of 4.25X.<br/><br/>During the March-end quarter, the company repurchased 1.4 million shares at an average price of $83.48, spending around $114 million. As of Mar 31, 2023, it had $2.0 billion of stock-repurchase capacity remaining under its authorized buyback program.<br/><br/>Currently, CBRE Group carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).",

In this article, we will discuss the factors that may have influenced the company's financial results in the first quarter, as well as its prospects for future growth.<br/><br/>In the last reported quarter, this New York-based experiential REIT, which owns the portfolios of market-leading gaming, hospitality and entertainment destinations, delivered a surprise of 2.0% in terms of adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share.<br/><br/>In the last four quarters, the company exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate on one occasion and met the same on the other three.

These include Caesars Palace Las Vegas, MGM Grand and the Venetian Resort Las Vegas.<br/><br/>With consumers returning to entertainment venues and travel activities resuming, the demand for VICI's properties is likely to have experienced a boost in the first quarter.<br/><br/>Over the past two years, the company has made concerted efforts to grow its portfolio and team up with the best-in-class tenants. Also, it has made strategic financing activities. Such efforts are likely to have aided VICI Properties’ performance in the quarter under review.<br/><br/>In the first quarter of 2023, VICI is expected to report robust revenue and earnings growth, driven by its diversified portfolio and strategic acquisitions as well as increased visitation and consumer spending.",

			"<strong>Welltower, Inc.</strong> WELL is slated to report first-quarter 2023 earnings on May 2, after market close. While the quarterly results are likely to reflect year-over-year revenue growth, funds from operations (FFO) per share are expected to have been on par with the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.<br/><br/>In the last reported quarter, this Toledo, OH-based healthcare real estate investment trust (REIT) witnessed normalized FFO per share of 83 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a whisker. The results reflected better-than-anticipated revenues. The total same-store net operating income (NOI) increased year over year, driven by same-store NOI growth in the seniors housing operating (SHO) portfolio.<br/><br/>Over the preceding four quarters, Welltower’s FFO per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions and met the same in the other two, the average surprise being 0.60%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:",
			"Welltower Inc. Price and EPS Surprise",
			"Welltower Inc. price-eps-surprise | Welltower Inc. Quote",
			"With Welltower’s communities continuing to accept new residents, its SHO portfolio is likely to have experienced healthy move-in activity during the first quarter. Also, a decline in construction starts and slower net inventory growth are expected to have boosted occupancy levels.<br/><br/>Moreover, SHO portfolio’s revenue per occupied room is anticipated to have benefited from robust pricing power, as evidenced by strong realized renewal rate growth and improving street rates.<br/><br/>Per WELL’s February business update, improvement in full-time employee hiring trends and lower agency usage are likely to have reduced overall compensation expense growth.<br/><br/>Consequently, positive revenue and expense trends are expected to have driven the company’s SHO portfolio net operating income growth.<br/><br/>The above-mentioned factors, coupled with the increased healthcare expenditure by the rapidly growing senior citizen population, are anticipated to have aided WELL’s SHO portfolio performance during the first quarter.<br/><br/>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter resident fees and services is pegged at $1.12 billion, indicating an increase of nearly 2% from the previous quarter’s reported number of $1.10 billion and 12.9% from the year-ago quarter’s $994.3 million. The consensus estimate for quarterly rental income stands at $369.6 million, implying a 3.7% rise from the prior-year quarter’s $356.4 million.<br/><br/>Total revenues for the quarter are pegged at $1.55 billion, suggesting a rise of 10.9% from the prior-year period’s reported number.<br/><br/>Welltower’s focus on strategic portfolio optimization and synergistic collaborations with health systems to invest in the next-generation assets of health and wellness care delivery bode well.<br/><br/>Also, the company’s portfolio restructuring initiatives are likely to have paid off well.<br/><br/>In January 2023, Welltower sold 15% interest in 31 skilled nursing assets to Integra Health for nearly $74 million, representing the second tranche of the earlier announced 85/15 joint venture (JV) between the entities as part of the transition of the 147-property skilled nursing portfolio. This portfolio was previously owned by Welltower and ProMedica in an 85/15 JV.<br/><br/>Furthermore, WELL’s capital-recycling efforts are likely to have helped maintain its solid balance sheet position during the quarter, supporting its near-term investment and development activities.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, higher interest rates and a stronger U.S. dollar are likely to have cast a pall on the company’s quarterly performance.<br/><br/>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter FFO per share has been unchanged at 82 cents over the past month. Moreover, the figure is likely to have remained on par with the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.",

			"<strong>UDR Inc.</strong> UDR reported first-quarter 2023 funds from operations as adjusted (FFOA) per share of 60 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a whisker.<br/><br/>Revenues from rental income of $398.3 million, too, lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $404.5 million.<br/><br/>Quarterly results reflect lower-than-anticipated revenues. A fall in occupancy and higher same-store expenses act as dampeners. Nonetheless, UDR benefited from a rise in blended lease rates and past accretive external growth investments. It also reaffirmed its 2023 outlook.<br/><br/>On a year-over-year basis, FFOA per share and revenues from rental income climbed 9.1% and 11.8%, respectively.<br/><br/>Per Tom Toomey, UDR’s chairman and CEO, “We are optimistic on the growth trajectory and resiliency of our business moving forward and continue to focus on what we can control: disciplined capital allocation to opportunistically create shareholder value, new and innovative initiatives to drive further margin expansion, and an investment-grade balance sheet with well-laddered maturities and plentiful liquidity.”",
			"In the reported quarter, same-store revenues (with concessions reported on a cash basis) increased 8.2% year over year. Same-store expenses were up 5.1%. Consequently, the same-store net operating income (NOI), with concessions reported on a cash basis, improved 9.5%.<br/><br/>UDR registered blended lease rate growth of 3.5% during the quarter.<br/><br/>The company recorded a residential bad debt reserve of $6.1 million in first-quarter 2023, down $2.6 million from fourth-quarter 2022. The figure was inclusive of $0.5 million related to its share from unconsolidated joint ventures.<br/><br/>The residential REIT’s weighted average same-store physical occupancy decreased 50 basis points year over year to 96.6%. Our estimate for the same was pegged at 96.7%.",
			"In the first quarter, UDR completed the construction of The MO, a $145 million, 300-home apartment community in Washington, DC. In addition, it achieved stabilization on two development communities — Vitruvian West Phase 3 in Dallas, TX, and The George Apartments in Philadelphia, PA.<br/><br/>UDR’s development pipeline totaled $187.5 million at the end of the reported quarter and was 41% funded. The active pipeline includes two communities for 415 homes.<br/><br/>At the end of the quarter, the company’s redevelopment pipeline of 1,623 homes aggregated $88.6 million and was 35% funded. This includes densification projects featuring the addition of 30 new apartment homes in one community.<br/><br/>The company’s Developer Capital Program investment aggregated $479.7 million with a weighted average return rate of 9.7% and a weighted average estimated remaining term of 3.5 years at the end of first-quarter 2023.",
			"As of Mar 31, 2023, UDR had $957.4 million of liquidity through a combination of cash and undrawn capacity on its credit facilities.<br/><br/>The total debt was $5.6 billion as of the same date, with no remaining consolidated maturities until 2024. In addition, net debt-to-EBITDAre declined to 5.7X in the first quarter from the year-ago quarter’s 6.4X.<br/><br/>UDR ended the first quarter with a weighted average interest rate of 3.25% and weighted average years to maturity of 6.3 years.",
			"The company provided second-quarter 2023 outlook and reaffirmed its full-year guidance.<br/><br/>It expects second-quarter 2023 FFOA per share in the range of 60-62 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at 63 cents currently.<br/><br/>For the full year, FFOA per share was maintained in the range of $2.45-$2.53. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is presently pegged at 2.50 cents, which lies within the guided range.<br/><br/>The company projects 5.5-7.5% year-over-year growth in same-store cash revenues and 6-8.5% growth in same-store NOI growth for 2023, remaining unchanged from its earlier projections.<br/><br/>Currently, UDR carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).<br/><br/>You can see <strong>the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.",

MAA also raised its outlook for 2023 core FFO per share.<br/><br/>Rental and other property revenues were $529.03 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $525.1 million. The reported figure was 11.1% higher than the previous-year quarter’s $476.1 million.<br/><br/>Per Eric Bolton, the chairman and chief executive officer of MAA, “Results for the first quarter were ahead of expectations as the demand for apartment housing across our portfolio remains strong.  Our portfolio is well positioned as we head into the busy summer leasing season.”",
			"The same-store portfolio’s revenues grew 11% on a year-over-year basis due to a rise of 12.6% in the average effective rent per unit.<br/><br/>However, the average physical occupancy for the same-store portfolio in the first quarter declined 40 basis points year over year to 95.5%. The reported figure met our estimate of 95.5%. The resident turnover for the same period was 46%. Same-store portfolio operating expenses flared up 8.3%.<br/><br/>On a blended basis, effective during the first quarter, the same-store portfolio leasing pricing of both new and renewing leases rose 3.9% from the prior lease. An 8.6% increase in renewing leases supported this growth, partially offset by a 0.5% fall for leases to new move-in residents. This mirrored usually slower seasonal leasing volumes.<br/><br/>Moreover, the same-store net operating income (NOI) reflected year-over-year growth of 12.5%.",

Its total debt average years to maturity was 7.7 years. As of Mar 31, 2023, unencumbered NOI was 95.1% of the total NOI.<br/><br/>Furthermore, during the reported quarter, MAA’s long-term debt rating was upgraded by Moody's Investors Service to A3 with a Stable outlook.",
			"As of the end of first-quarter 2023, MAA redeveloped 1,328 apartment homes, while Smart Home technology installations completed were in 18,254 units.<br/><br/>As of Mar 31, 2023, MAA had six communities under development, with a total projected cost of $731.5 million and an estimated $388.9 million remaining to be funded. The projected average stabilized NOI yield is 5.6% for the same.<br/><br/>During the first quarter, MAA closed the buyout of a six-acre land parcel in Orlando, FL, for around $12 million. The purchased land parcel will be utilized for future development.  <br/><br/>MAA also disposed of land parcels in the Gulf Shores of Alabama market, totaling 21 acres.",
			"MAA raised its guidance for 2023 core FFO per share.<br/><br/>This residential REIT now estimates the same in the range of $8.93-$9.29, with a midpoint of $9.11. The earlier projected range was $8.88-$9.28, with a midpoint of $9.08. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $9.12, which lies within the guided range.<br/><br/>For the full year, management maintained its outlook for same-store property revenue growth at 5.25-7.25% and operating expense growth between 5.15% and 7.15%. As a result, the same-store NOI growth was retained in the range of 5.30-7.30%.

A fall in occupancy and higher same-store expenses act as dampeners. Nonetheless, UDR benefited from a rise in blended lease rates and past accretive external growth investments. It also reaffirmed its 2023 outlook.<br/><br/>On a year-over-year basis, FFOA per share and revenues from rental income climbed 9.1% and 11.8%, respectively.<br/><br/><em>Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent FFO — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.</em>",

			"<strong>Kimco Realty Corp.</strong>’s KIM first-quarter 2023 funds from operations (FFO) per share came in at 39 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure was on par with the year-ago quarter’s tally and our estimate.<br/><br/>Results reflect better-than-anticipated revenues, aided by rental rate growth and a rise in occupancy. It revised its 2023 FFO per share outlook.<br/><br/>This retail REIT clocked in revenues of $442.9 million, beating the consensus mark of $440.2 million and our estimate of $432.2 million. Quarterly revenues improved 3.7% year over year.<br/><br/>According to Conor Flynn, Kimco’s CEO, “Our team continues to drive strong leasing performance, with the 4.5 million square feet leased this quarter further validating the demand for our well-located, high-quality portfolio of open-air, grocery-anchored shopping centers in the most coveted locations across the country.”",
			"Pro-rata portfolio occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 95.8%, reflecting an expansion of 110 basis points (bps) year over year and 10 bps sequentially. Pro-rata anchor occupancy was 97.8%, up 50 bps year over year. Pro-rata small shop occupancy ended the quarter at 90.7%, representing an uptick of 230 bps from the prior-year quarter.<br/><br/>The company signed 600 leases, aggregating 4.5 million square feet in the quarter. Blended pro-rata rent spreads on comparable spaces increased 10.3%, with rental rates for new leases jumping 44% and renewals and options rising 7.7%.<br/><br/>Same-property net operating income (NOI) grew 1.4% year over year to $326.2 million, backed by a rise in minimum rent of 4.3%.",
			"In the reported quarter, Kimco acquired the remaining 85% interest in three California grocery-anchored shopping centers for $127.5 million.<br/><br/>The company also purchased two improved, adjacent parcels at existing shopping centers for $14.6 million.<br/><br/>Kimco disposed of three power centers and two land parcels covering 592,000 square feet for $98.9 million. The company’s pro-rata share of the sales price was $96.9 million.",
			"This retail REIT exited the first quarter of 2023 with more than $2.3 billion of immediate liquidity. This included full availability under its $2-billion unsecured revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents of $329.2 million.<br/><br/>Kimco generated net proceeds of $137.4 million from the sale of 7.1 million shares of<strong> Albertsons Companies, Inc. </strong>ACI common stock during the first quarter. Following the quarter end, Kimco sold an additional 7 million shares of ACI common stock, generating net proceeds of $144.9 million. Kimco held 14.2 million shares of ACI common stock as of Apr 27, 2023, which are valued at roughly $300 million.<br/><br/>Its net-debt-to-EBITDA was 6.2X on a look-through basis at the end of the reported quarter, down from 6.4X year over year.",
			"Concurrent with the first-quarter earnings release, Kimco’s board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 23 cents per share, representing a 15% increase year over year. This dividend will be paid out on Jun 22 to its shareholders on record as of Jun 8, 2023.",
			"For 2023, Kimco projects FFO per share in the range of $1.54-$1.57, revised from the prior outlook of $1.53-$1.57. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $1.56, which lies within the guided range.<br/><br/>Kimco also lowered its assumption for lease termination income for 2023 from $14-$16 million projected earlier to $4-$6 million. Other assumptions, such as that of same property NOI growth of 1.0-2.0% and total property acquisitions (including structured investments), net of dispositions, of $100 million remained unchanged.<br/><br/>Kimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

			"We now look forward to the earnings releases of other retail REITs like <strong>Simon Property Group </strong>SPG and <strong>Federal Realty Investment Trust</strong> FRT. While Simon Property Group is slated to report on May 2, Federal Realty is scheduled on May 4.<br/><br/>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Simon Property’s first-quarter 2023 FFO per share is pegged at $2.80, suggesting a marginal increase year-over-year. SPG currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.<br/><br/>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Federal Realty’s first-quarter 2023 FFO per share is pegged at $1.57, implying a year-over-year increase of 4.7%.

Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.",

Our full-year outlook is supported by the same dynamics we saw in the first quarter – benefits from the diversification of our business and our intense focus on cost. There is more uncertainty in our outlook than there was 60 days ago, with our expectations underpinned by our view that a recession this year will be moderate and that an eventual easing of the Fed’s monetary policy will spur a rebound in economic activity in 2024.\"",

			"Our management generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes. The company believes these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected charges that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business. The company further uses certain of these measures, and believes that they are useful to investors, for purposes described below.",
			"With respect to net revenue, net revenue is gross revenue less costs largely associated with subcontracted vendor work performed for clients. We believe that investors may find this measure useful to analyze the company’s overall financial performance because it excludes costs reimbursable by clients that generally have no margin, and as such provides greater visibility into the underlying performance of our business.",
			"With respect to Core EBITDA, business line operating profit/loss, and segment operating profit on revenue and net revenue margins, the company believes that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the accounting effects of acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions, the effects of financings and income tax and the accounting effects of capital spending. All of these measures may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. In the case of Core EBITDA, this measure is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management’s discretionary use because it does not consider cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. The Core EBITDA measure calculated herein may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our credit facilities and debt instruments, which amounts are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt. The company also uses segment operating profit and core EPS as significant components when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs.",

			"<strong>Mark J. Parrell</strong>",
			"Thank you, Marty. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today to discuss our first quarter 2023 results. We had a very good quarter to start the year with same-store revenue results exceeding our expectations. And while same-store expense growth was higher than we projected due in large part to California storms, that still left us with first quarter net operating income and normalized FFO better than we expected.<br/>In a moment, Mike will take you through our first quarter operating highlights. The strength of our revenue results point to the durable nature of our business in the face of volatile economic conditions. <br/>We continue to see substantial demand from our affluent renter demographic and moderate levels of supply in most of our major markets, with the new news in the quarter being the rapidly improving regulatory conditions in California. Based on these continuing positive business conditions and the good prospects we see for our business going forward, during the first quarter, our board raised our common share dividend by 6% on an annualized basis. Despite headlines and layoffs, demand feels solid. <br/>The unemployment rate, particularly for the college educated, remains very low, which gives us a good feeling about the employability and earnings power of our affluent renter customer. In our portfolio, we are not seeing increases in residents downsizing their units or giving us their keys because of job loss. In terms of competition from homeownership, monthly costs and down payment requirements remain high in our markets, especially relative to rents, making renting a high-quality equity residential apartment a better value.<br/>Only 8% of our residents who moved out in the first quarter bought a home, and that's down from 12% in the first quarter of 2022. On the apartment supply side, as we have discussed with you on previous calls, we expect 2023 national apartment new supply to run at record levels. But we generally feel good about the level of direct competition that supply will pose to us, given our market mix and importantly, the location of supply within markets relative to our properties. In our coastal markets where we still have 95% of our NOI, we see very manageable competitive new supply in most markets, with Washington, D.C. being the exception, though D.C. is holding up remarkably well so far. <br/>In the Sunbelt markets, including the Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin and Atlanta markets in which we are increasingly investing. And in Denver, we are seeing higher relative supply and more impact. We anticipated this when we acquired our Sunbelt in Denver properties, and these properties are generally tracking consistently with our underwriting. <br/>As we look to expand our portfolio in these markets, we expect that these new deliveries will present buying opportunities for us. Mike will also discuss first quarter same-store expense growth, which was higher than we expected, especially in the repairs and maintenance and other on-site operating expenses lines. <br/>We think this growth was inflated for discrete reasons that will pass, and we continue to be comfortable in attaining our full year same-store expense range in part due to lower than previously anticipated real estate tax growth, combined with modest on-site payroll expense growth. We have created at our company a culture and system that uses technology and centralization to improve the customer and employee experience and to contain our payroll costs. <br/>While the transaction markets remain unsettled, we did do a couple of deals to start the year. We sold a small collection of 25-year-old properties that totaled 247 units in Los Angeles for about $135 million in advance of the transfer tax increase. Also after the end of the quarter, we purchased a newly developed property in Atlanta for about $79 million that is currently in lease-up.<br/>The property is located directly on a portion of the Atlanta beltline that is being improved and paved. The beltline is a desirable amenity to our demographic and has been a catalyst for economic growth and densification across the area.<br/>The property's economics benefit from various tax credits and when fully stabilized next year, we expect to attain a 6.6% acquisition cap rate. Removing the tax benefits, which will burn off over time, we see the stabilized fully taxed acquisition cap rate at 5.7%. We also love our basis in this property, which is at $288,000 per unit, and we see that as a 15% to 20% discount to current replacement costs. Alex Brackenridge, our Chief Investment Officer, is here with us to answer your questions on the transaction market. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.",
			"<strong>Michael L. Manelis</strong>",
			"Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This morning, I'm going to review key takeaways from our first quarter 2023 operating performance in our markets, along with same-store operating expenses. As Mark mentioned, we produced very good same-store revenue growth of 9.2% in the first quarter. These results were ahead of our expectations, primarily due to continuing improvement in delinquency along with continued healthy fundamentals in the business.<br/>Before I get into more details on these topics, I want to emphasize that as we sit here today, the early stages of the leasing season and its setup remains strong. With year-to-date pricing trend improvement just above 3.25%, which is where we would expect it to be at this point in the year and is also consistent with expectations underpinning guidance. During the quarter, we continued to see good demand and strong resident retention that produced low turnover, stable occupancy and solid pricing power. <br/>Despite some recent negative job headlines, our average resident remains in great financial shape. With rent income ratios during the quarter for new residents continuing to hover around 20%. The Resident lease breaks due to job loss and transfer activities to reduce rent, often early indicators of resident economic threats remain below pre-pandemic levels and in line with seasonal expectations. A resilient labor market, along with a large number of young adults choosing the exciting attractive lifestyles our markets provide, along with the convenience and cost benefits of renting continues to result in application volumes that are on par with the same period last year and continue to grow as expected into the leasing season.<br/>Couple this with the favorable supply position and lack of single-family home ownership competition that Mark outlined, and we should be positioned for another good year. Results to date support the view we shared on our February earnings call that we expect pricing trends for this year to follow a normal, albeit slightly muted seasonal trajectory. Given the difficult comparison periods for 2022 for the back half of the year, along with the return to normal rent growth patterns, we expect that the first quarter will be our highest reported same-store revenue growth with more moderate but still above historical growth in subsequent quarters.<br/>While there may be some uncertainty about the economy, including increasing layoff announcements, as I said previously, we are not seeing this impact our day-to-day operations. While we acknowledge that we are generally a lagging indicator, so far so good as we head to our primary leasing season. Now let me spend a few minutes talking about our market performance. Let's start with the East Coast. New York and D.C. are both exceeding expectations, while Boston is in line. New York was by far the top performer for the first quarter with same-store revenue growth of over 19%.<br/>With very limited and isolated supply, the outperformance in this market is consistent across all submarkets. Occupancy is currently 97.5% and all demand indicators continue to flash green, making this market the expected top performer for the year. Turning to D.C. Performance has thus far been a pleasant surprise with the market continuing to absorb significant new supply, while still delivering good revenue growth.<br/>Similar to New York, occupancy is strong, and so far, all submarkets remain resilient in the face of new supply. Now for the West Coast, Southern California continues to post good numbers. And most notably, we are starting to see improvement in delinquency, particularly in Los Angeles, which has the heaviest concentration. As the eviction moratorium expired, we are seeing more of our delinquent residents figuring out the best option that works for them, which is either paying rent or moving out.<br/>This activity started to pick up pace late in the first quarter, which was sooner than we expected and has continued into April. While these move-outs are pressuring physical occupancy, it will benefit our financial results later in the year as we have good demand in the market to replace these residents with new residents that will pay their rent.<br/>Our remaining 2 West Coast markets of San Francisco and Seattle have posted respectable quarter-over-quarter revenue growth with good demand, but pricing power remains less than desired, especially in the urban centers of both of these markets. The San Francisco market is performing in line with our expectations, which already assumed a slow recovery. Use of concessions, mostly in the downtown submarket remains common along with limited pricing power.<br/>Meanwhile, the South Bay submarket is demonstrating signs of improving pricing power and stronger occupancy with less widespread concession use based on a combination of factors that includes a greater variety of stable employers who are committed to the area, coupled with just a better overall quality of life. Heading to Seattle, the overall market continues to demonstrate a lack of recovery, which wasn't completely unexpected, but is behind our forecast.<br/>Similar to Downtown San Francisco, Downtown Seattle lacks pricing power with concessions being used on over 70% of our applications. The East side, which we felt may hold up a little bit better, is still outperforming downtown, but is a little more challenging than we thought based on supply pressure, layoffs and overall just less hiring in the submarket.<br/>Amazon's May 1 mandatory return to the office date has a potential to be a catalyst for this market. Finally, in our expansion markets, which currently make up a little less than 5% of our same-store NOI, revenue performance has mostly been in line with our acquisition performance and guidance expectations. As we expected, we are being impacted by heavy new supply in Austin, Dallas and Denver.<br/>Meanwhile, Atlanta remained strong with double-digit revenue growth for the quarter. Now moving to expenses. We reported same-store expense growth of 7.2% in the quarter, which was slightly above our expectations. We had always expected Q1 growth to be higher than our full year guidance range, mostly because the growth during the first quarter of 2022 was so low, but also from pressure on a few specific items that outpaced positives in a few other expense categories.<br/>On the favorable side, we continue to benefit from good performance in real estate taxes and payroll, along with utilities, which were still elevated but lower than expected. On the unfavorable side, incremental cost in repairs and maintenance, other on-site costs and higher-than-anticipated insurance costs drove higher-than-expected first quarter same-store expense growth.<br/>For most of these costs, we had anticipated an increase but not quite to this degree. Elevated repairs and maintenance was in large part due to increased outsourcing in the quarter much of which stemmed from our own internal teams in California, focusing on the after effects of the severe rainstorms, which resulted in incremental outside vendor assistance. <br/>Higher legal and administrative costs related to faster progress in response to the expiration of the eviction moratorium, the benefit of which can be seen in our bad debt net. Insurance expense was higher due to tougher conditions than the already challenging environment we assumed on the renewal of our property insurance policy, which was completed during the first quarter. Despite this pressure, we remain comfortable with our existing guidance range on the full year same-store expense growth. At this point, we expect slower full year growth in real estate tax and utilities than we initially expected to offset the overages experienced in other categories in the first quarter.<br/>Lastly, I want to spend a minute on our focus on innovation and the technology evolution of our platform. In 2023, we have a positive NOI impact of just over $10 million included in our guidance with about 2/3 of that coming on the expense side primarily in payroll and repair and maintenance. This benefit will mostly be realized in second half of the year which will contribute to lower expense growth for that period. On the revenue side we will continue to focus on other income items like WiFi, parking and pricing optimization. We will also leverage data analytics to create opportunities to expand our operating margins. Our vision is to augment pricing and renewal strategies by combining our growing data science capabilities with streamlined execution while delivering self-service solutions to our customers.<br/>We will continue to leverage our mobile platform to create opportunities to share on-site employees across multiple properties. With a fully centralized and mobile operating platform, we are in a strong position to create a seamless customer experience with a platform that continues to allow us to innovate, experiment and rapidly scale what works across the portfolio.<br/>This uniquely positions our company to continue to create additional revenue streams while managing expenses to maintain and grow margins even in an inflationary climate. I want to give a shout out for our amazing teams across our platform for their continued dedication to their residents and focus on delivering these terrific operating results.<br/>With that, we will turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&amp;A session. Thank you.",

			"(Operator Instructions) <br/>And our first question is going to come from Eric Wolfe from Citi.",
			"<strong>Eric Wolfe</strong>",
			"Just looking at your same-store revenue guidance, it looks like you're expecting roughly 4% growth for the rest of the year, maybe a bit higher if you're accounting to be better trends in bad debt. But just curious whether it's sort of the majority of the drop-off happens in 2Q and then sort of stabilizes? Or if the drop-off is a little bit more ratable through the year?",
			"<strong>Robert A. Garechana</strong>",
			"Eric, it's Bob. I would say that the drop-off is more ratable through the year because what's going on in the 2023 kind of guidance is really more about what's happened in 2022, than the kind of core trajectory of the business. So we continue to expect kind of that sequential leasing component, but you start getting into -- starting in Q2 and really into Q3. Difficult comp periods from 2022. And so you'll see Q1 as the high point and then a pretty consistent but above trend quarter-over-quarter rate of growth as you go through the back end of the year.",
			"<strong>Eric Wolfe</strong>",
			"Got it. And then I think you said you expect the peak leasing season to play out as it normally would. But I also thought I heard you say that rent growth might be a bit more muted for its history. So just trying to tie those 2 statements together? I'm just trying to understand if market rents are sort of growing as they normally would during the peak leasing season.",
			"<strong>Michael L. Manelis</strong>",
			"Yes. Eric, this is Michael. So I think there's 2 factors. One, the way that the rents are moving, and I said, albeit a little bit muted, that's more indicative to when we think about normal rent patterns of pricing trends. We came into the year with our guidance expecting the sequential build. We just didn't think we were going to see kind of outsized momentum anywhere near the pace that we saw last year. And in terms of the setup right now, I guess I would just say the portfolio is sitting at 96.1% today. We've got great momentum. The blended rate for April sitting right at 4%, you get the sequential build and pricing trend at 3.25%, which basically positions us right where we thought we would be heading into this peak leasing season.",
			"<strong>Mark J. Parrell</strong>",
			"Yes. Just to supplement that, Eric, it's Mark. It's the difference between guidance when we gave our guidance, we talked about the year being kind of like a normal year 2023, but maybe a little bit less of intra-period growth and what's going on so far this year. And so far this year, absolutely consistent with that expectation. So it's -- those 2 terms are being used to describe different things, guidance versus so far so good this year.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question is going to come from John Pawlowski from Green Street.",
			"<strong>John Joseph Pawlowski</strong>",
			"Bob, the first question is on real estate taxes. I know this year is faring well. Just be curious, as you stare out the next few years, are you seeing any early examples or hearing any chatter that cities need to tax apartments a little bit harder to fill the hole left by office and other commercial real estate sectors that are seeing impaired valuations?",
			"<strong>Robert A. Garechana</strong>",
			"Yes, I would say that not a lot of chatter yet because we're really just focused on 2023. And to your point, John, 2023 is actually better than what we anticipated. <br/>Obviously, we have that Anchor with prop 13 in California, which is helpful. As you move beyond, you always deal with that issue of revenue gaps and budgetary gaps and where people are going to get money out of what pocket. So far, we feel good about where we are, very good about where we are in 2023. And it's too early to tell -- but with these municipalities, what they'll do in 2024, what those revenue gaps will look like and where -- what pockets they'll come to get it. So, so far, I'd say too early to tell for '24.",
			"<strong>John Joseph Pawlowski</strong>",
			"Okay. And then last one for me. Michael, just curious if you could expand on the softness in pricing power you're seeing in Denver and your expansion markets. I know it's a small sample size of properties, but just curious how you're seeing fundamentals on the ground there relative to some softer West Coast markets.",
			"<strong>Michael L. Manelis</strong>",
			"Yes. I mean I think I would carve them out a little bit different. So Denver, you clearly have supply pressure sitting on top of us in the downtown submarket, but yet the suburban portfolios are actually doing pretty well. When we go into the Texas markets, we clearly are seeing just more concessions being used. You have demand, right? But when you look at across all of these expansion markets, any of the reported data, including our own portfolio, which again is a pretty small subset.<br/>It's less than 5% of the company's NOI. The occupancies tend to be running lower in these kind of expansion markets for us. The one exception I would say for us is Atlanta, seems to be doing a little bit better than even what we thought coming into the year. We just don't have quite as much supply pressure on us. So we see a little bit better pricing power than what we thought.",
			"<strong>John Joseph Pawlowski</strong>",
			"Okay. Would you expect Denver and Texas NOI growth to lag or outpace your legacy footprint over the next year or 2?",
			"<strong>Michael L. Manelis</strong>",
			"Oh, I mean I think clearly, our coastal markets right now are set up not even for this year, but just the entire setup, the demand drivers that we see, the cost of housing in those markets has really positioned them to outperform. But again, as we went into these sunbelt, we knew like what to expect for these first couple of years. So for us, the positive is that -- the large majority of our acquisitions are trending slightly ahead of how we perform in them and clearly in line with our expectations for this year.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Next question is from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI.",
			"<strong>Stephen Thomas Sakwa</strong>",
			"Just a couple of follow-ups on the topline growth. Michael, I know you don't necessarily guide to leasing spreads, new renewals or blend. But just any thoughts on kind of where our spreads might be for the year? And it certainly sounded like bad debt is trending better. I realize it might be a little too early, but how much of a tailwind could that be if things continue sort of on the path they're on today?",
			"<strong>Michael L. Manelis</strong>",
			"Yes. Well, maybe I'll start, and Bob, you can kind of build a little bit on the bad debt. So in terms of just the leasing spreads and kind of guide, a lot of that had to do with where we were with our embedded growth, where we were with loss to lease, capturing the loss to lease. And I think I said, right, as we were working through the call back in February, we expected roughly 2%, 2.25% on new lease change for the full year, renewals right around 5% and blended is right around 4% for the full year. When you look at where we sit today, we're set up going into our peak leasing season, where, again, we're going to do 60% of the transaction.<br/>We're set up right where we thought we would be relative to the guidance. We have a little bit of pressure that we're doing more concessions in those downtown submarkets in Seattle and San Francisco. But that's kind of being offset by some of the outperformance we're seeing in the East Coast markets.",
			"<strong>Robert A. Garechana</strong>",
			"Yes. And Steve, on the bad debt side, just to fill out the question, we are -- we certainly did better in the first quarter. We expected the first quarter to sequentially be equivalent, excluding governmental rental assistance to the fourth quarter, and we're a couple of million dollars better. And that equates to a little bit under 10 basis points on a full year basis for revenue.<br/>That trajectory is continuing into April, so it's still early. And so we would expect to perform better overall. But keep in mind, the 90 basis points assume that we're having improvement. So it's just how much that improvement is better relative to what we embedded in guidance, but we do think there's potential upside there. To the extent we continue to see that same pace as we play out through April into May and the rest of the year.",
			"<strong>Mark J. Parrell</strong>",
			"And Steve, it's Mark. Just to help you with your mod a little. The governmental payments are really key to the volatility because in the first quarter of '22, we got about $9.5 million of governmental rental relief. In the second quarter, we got almost $15 million in 2022. So we need to make up that difference in terms of improved delinquency performance in the second quarter. And then you drop all the way down to a little below $6 million in the third quarter and then only $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. So you can see that those rental relief payments are key to understanding. So the delinquency, we think, will improve the whole year, but there could be quarters where bad debt net because it's being compared to a number with so much governmental rental relief in it is just not as good as it appears to be, and then the next quarter, you'll see it even back out.",
			"<strong>Stephen Thomas Sakwa</strong>",
			"Okay. And then just, I guess, second question is on sort of capital deployment. I mean, you guys did raise acquisitions and dispositions to still be net zero. But I'm just curious what -- and maybe distress you're sort of seeing in the marketplace and what opportunities that might afford you thinking back to the coming out of GFC, you guys were early to buy broken condos and did the [Macro] transaction. I'm just curious if you're starting to see things percolate and -- and I guess secondly, are you seeing a big slowdown in new starts or planned starts from maybe some of the competitors and merchant builders?",
			"<strong>Alexander Brackenridge</strong>",
			"Steve, this is Alex. Well, first of all, transaction volume is down pretty dramatically. So the closings will be down about 60-plus percent across the country. And that's pretty evenly spread among the different markets. So a lot less activity, but the sellers that do act now understand that cap rates are somewhere between 5% and 5.25%. So they're eager to transact. And that comes from really 3 different types of sellers. There's the private REITs that have the redemption request that they have to fulfill. <br/>So we're seeing some activity from them. The merchant builders aren't really capitalized to own property in the long run. They always expect it to be able to execute and get out of the deal. So a little bit of that. And gives some floating rate borrowers who have caps that are expiring that they are not able to cover. So there are sources of opportunity, but it's really been slow so far. But I would expect all 3 of those areas are more likely to pick up than not in the next 6 months. <br/>So we are excited to deploy more capital as those opportunities arise. And as you mentioned in the past, we've taken advantage of dislocation in the market. So we're certainly set up to that. But in the meantime, we're trading in and out of properties, so selling -- dispose opportunistically and taking advantage of acquisitions that we see.<br/>In terms of starts, I mean, they're dramatically down. Already this year, what we were thinking in our markets would be, say, 110,000 starts is now looking like it might be half of that today, and I expect even more things that we thought might start will drop off the list through the rest of the year.<br/>It's really hard to make a development work in an environment where cap rates are, as I said, 5% to 5.25%, you need a yield at least around a 6%. And you just can't get there with costs that may not be rising as high as quickly as they used to a year or so ago, but they're still going up, and obviously, financing costs are higher. So it's just really hard to make a development underwrite. So we expect to see more and more deals drop out, development deals.",
			"<strong>Mark J. Parrell</strong>",
			"Yes. And Steve, it's Mark. Just to supplement that. I mean all this supply in the Sunbelt markets, Denver, places we'd like more long-term exposure, but we recognize that it's going to be a tough couple of years, that's an opportunity for us. I mean we're going to sell low performing assets in the coastal markets are assets where we have an over concentration in the sub market and kind of trade in and accepting that there might be a little near-term decline and putting it in the pro forma. But as you said, I mean, I'm very hopeful. I think we're in a really good spot where our numbers are going to show well comparatively in the costal markets, we'll exercise our usual good expense control, and then we'll turn around and deploy capital. And Alex got a big team, a very capable, experienced people out there ready to buy. So I think we'll be active as soon as those opportunities are more substantial.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Chandni Luthra from Goldman Sachs.",
			"<strong>Chandni Luthra</strong>",
			"This is Chandni Luthra, Goldman. Could you guys help us understand what the collections process will look like from here? And what the magnitude and timing of recovery from past accounts could shape up to be. Like do you have to go to courts to get rents from tenants who are perhaps no longer active with you or you're just evicting now? And what kind of experience are folks witnessing with the court processes these days?",
			"<strong>Michael L. Manelis</strong>",
			"Yes. Chandni, it's Michael. So we clearly have evictions filed right now with the courts. You are seeing a little bit of momentum pick up. I would tell you across the country right now, it feels like most of this stuff is set up at about a 6-month timeframe from the time you file to the time you actually get to your proceeding with a court date. <br/>But really what's happening on the collections front is twofold. So one, you have individuals that you are filing on that have a lot of past balances with you. But if they start paying you current month's rent, those past balances are somewhat protected still to date and go out into like '24. I think maybe some of them even stretch into '25. So you have a little bit of a longer tail to go after the previous balances to collect.<br/>But we are starting to see this resident behavior where they're making decisions either to move out in front of any kind of eviction proceeding or actually just start paying us their current month's rent knowing that we're ultimately going to have to come to terms with what happens with this previous balance. In areas where those balances are not protected, we have sent much of that over to the collection agencies and let collection agencies start working. <br/>That's a slow process because typically, what you need to see is a lifestyle change. You need to see somebody needing to go buy a car or a home or some other thing that then causes them to come to terms that they got to clean up that balance. So I think what you should expect to see is the court system is going to continue to move at this pace of, call it, the 6-month window. And you'll see us gradually just start chipping away at this delinquency and gradually start to improve the recovery of this -- of the past balance.",
			"<strong>Chandni Luthra</strong>",
			"So then can there be a reversal to some write-offs or some reserves that you've taken in the past as we sort of think about the magnitude going forward?",
			"<strong>Robert A. Garechana</strong>",
			"Yes, certainly. To the extent that all of those historical balances that Michael just described have been written off. So to the extent that you collect them, you would see that as a current period pickup offsetting bad debt. So those collections would flow through. But as Michael mentioned, we would expect that. We don't -- haven't really incorporated much of that overall that we'd expect that to really trail.",
			"<strong>Chandni Luthra</strong>",
			"Got it. Very helpful. And a follow-up question is on L.A. mansion tax. So obviously, you guys sold a property ahead of that sort of tax change on April 1. But as we think about the composition of your current portfolio and what you've laid out in the past that you want basically 33% of your portfolio. It's sitting in sort of each of the coasts and then 33 in the Sunbelt. How do you think about the impact from this policy change to affect how you think about sort of selling properties in L.A. going forward and you're reaching towards that optimal mix of geography that you've laid out in the past?",
			"<strong>Alexander Brackenridge</strong>",
			"Well, clearly, it has an impact. It's a big move in the rate from 1.5% to 5.5% in L.A. And it was designed to raise cap the (inaudible) money for cities to build affordable housing. I think it probably had the reverse effect and that there won't be that many transactions, so they're not going to collect very much. So it may be that this gets reduced over time.<br/>So we don't know that it will be around forever because it doesn't seem to be well thought out public policy. But in the meantime, there are other ways -- other properties that aren't subject to the tax within California that we can transact on. And we can also consider joint ventures as an opportunity to lower exposure in a market like L.A., where selling a property may not make a lot of sense.",
			"<strong>Mark J. Parrell</strong>",
			"Yes. Chandni, it's Mark. And just to supplement Alex answer. We -- I mean, it certainly impacts the tactical way to get to the success to lower that exposure. But mean we remain committed to the goal, and we're just going to figure out different ways to do it. And again, maybe you're selling properties in Ventura County instead or in -- outside the city of San Francisco and the County of Los Angeles, and we have plenty of those, too. So we've got other levers to pull, and we'll be thoughtful about that.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Next question goes to Michael Goldsmith from UBS.",
			"<strong>Michael Goldsmith</strong>",
			"On the concessions, have they gotten better or worse as the year has progressed? And is the gap between markets? Is it getting lighter or narrower?",
			"<strong>Michael L. Manelis</strong>",
			"Yes. So Michael, this is Michael. So concessions for us right now are really concentrated in those urban centers of Seattle and San Francisco. I think what you saw when we turned the corner into January, and we were getting on that first -- or the fourth quarter call, I was telling you that the demand was picking up, and you saw the concessions starting to slow down across most of the markets that absolutely held true almost all of the markets now have weaned themselves off of the concessions, except what we saw in somewhere around that middle of February and into March, you really saw the concession use pick up in those downtown urban centers of Seattle and San Francisco, and they've been fairly constant.<br/>I'll tell you the last couple of weeks, we see a little bit of hope right now that the demand is picking up. Application volume is picking up in those areas, and you could start to see us get to a place where we could start pulling them back again. But for the most part, just in the rearview mirror, they've been constant for the last couple of months for us.",
			"<strong>Michael Goldsmith</strong>",
			"That's very helpful. And then my second question is on the transaction market. Does this 5.7% stabilized cap rate on the Atlanta deal, does that represent a motivated seller or a function of the actual market? Is this where deals are going forward? And maybe just on a broader terms, like -- are you starting to see a reopening of the transaction market now that you're guiding to a modest amount of activity in the year?",
			"<strong>Alexander Brackenridge</strong>",
			"Michael, this is Alex. The 5.7% really isn't a reflection of market. It's more a reflection of the property being in lease-up right now. So we're taking it over the middle of a lease-up and we're going to finish it off. So we're getting compensated for doing that. So I would say, as I said earlier on the call, the rates are somewhere between 5% and 5.25% for a typical deal. And so yes, we're getting a little bit of a boost there because we're taking on a little bit of a lease-up, but that's not an indication of market. And then in terms of other opportunities, I mean, we're obviously always looking for other opportunities, and it has been pretty slow though so far.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question will come from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank.",
			"<strong>Nicholas Philip Yulico</strong>",
			"So I want to go back to the topic of job losses. And I know you said that you're really not seeing that much of an impact. But are there any indications yet of job losses of residents impacting expected turnover? I mean, is there anything you're learning now as you're sending renewal notices out for the spring? And I guess if there's any differentiation you're seeing on this topic between tech heavier markets like San Francisco, Bay Area, Seattle, where there has been more high-profile job losses announced versus other markets of yours.",
			"<strong>Mark J. Parrell</strong>",
			"Yes, Nick, it's Mark. I'm going to start, and Michael is going to supplement with some market specifics. I mean, again, when we look at the general economics, professional and business services, for example, still has positive job growth. And that's an area where we do have a lot of our residents employed. <br/>Finance and insurance kind of flat, information service is certainly down but not down that dramatically, and the unemployment rate remains very low, especially for the college educated. So I guess, I just want to point out again on the macro. The macro picture is very good for our company and for the markets we sit in, not just in the long term, but in the near term in the here and now. So certainly, there can be another shoe that drops, but the current numbers we're all seeing are certainly declined from the COVID recovery numbers, but they're still pretty good, and people losing jobs are finding them. And that's been the experience that looks to me like in the general economy. And I'll let Michael comment on what he's seeing in the rest of our portfolio.",
			"<strong>Michael L. Manelis</strong>",
			"Yes. And I think, one, you got to put into context that the reported turnover for the first quarter was really low. I mean it's not quite record little, but it's really low number. So the absolute number of move-outs that we're having is clearly below any kind of historical norms.<br/>And when we start drilling in and we look at those reasons for move-out, we're really not seeing anything indicative of changes. You're not seeing kind of job loss or job change pick up anything different than what you would expect for the first quarter of any given year. Specific into like a Seattle or San Francisco where you saw kind of more of the headlines and we said on the last call, we thought a lot of those layoffs were being dispersed across the country, not just heavily concentrated in those markets. I think what you've seen, we have not seen anybody really give us keys telling us they're breaking the lease or they're not renewing because they were laid off. <br/>What we do notice in those 2 markets is the in-migration, meaning what percent of brand new residents are coming to us from outside of that MSA. The in-migration in those 2 areas is less than what you otherwise would have expected, which I think makes sense given not only the layoffs, but more importantly, like the hiring freezes that have been taking place. So you're just not seeing them draw into the market like they used to.",
			"<strong>Nicholas Philip Yulico</strong>",
			"That's very helpful. My second question is going back to Los Angeles. And it's a market that doesn't look like it has much supply, except for Downtown. And you did talk about delinquent -- dealing with delinquent units going forward, right? In some cases, it's impacting occupancy right now or at some point, it will. And I guess what I'm wondering is how you think -- how you feel comfortable with this.<br/>It's almost like a shadow supply type of scenario where you and other landlords are finally getting tenants out in L.A. and that you feel confident that there's enough demand to fill tenants leaving?",
			"<strong>Mark J. Parrell</strong>",
			"Yes. Again, it's Mark, Nick to start, and Michael may have something to add here. But I'll start by talking about the employment base of our residents as we see it in the market. So we looked at sort of the big tech majors, and we said what percent of our residents have stated that they're employed by those big companies in Los Angeles, and that's something on the order of 3%. So I think we just have very low exposure to those sort of tech folks in the very diversified L.A. economy.<br/>So I think L.A. just, frankly, is stronger than San Francisco Bay Area and stronger than Seattle right now where we have higher numbers of our residents employed by those sorts of people and probably bigger local economic impacts. So I think we're, in your opinion -- it's almost like we have 2 empty buildings in Los Angeles, we're delivering into same-store over the rest of this year and that we're going to fill up, and we've got the demand for it.<br/>So I think when you look at the local economy, that matches up very well with our portfolio. They're in content creation. They're in other businesses, some of which feel some pressure. But this disproportionate tech layoff, that isn't a Los Angeles phenomenon that's occurring to all over the country. In the extent there's any concentration, it's more San Francisco and Seattle than it is L.A.",
			"<strong>Nicholas Philip Yulico</strong>",
			"Yes, No, I wasn't specifically really wondering about tech in L.A. I just meant the issue of delinquent units coming back to market for you and other landlords, right, as you're getting people out and rates almost a supply issue in the market.",
			"<strong>Mark J. Parrell</strong>",
			"Yes, but the supply is being met by people that have jobs. That was the point of my comment. It isn't -- a lot of these people are in diversified industries. So it isn't like everyone is losing their job down in Los Angeles. There's -- it's very well employed down there. A lot of people looking for housing, a lot of demand, Michael sees good demand numbers in terms of applications and the like. So that's the source of our confidence, a diversified economy in which -- like I said, us and others are effectively delivering empty buildings into that, but I'm confident that demand will need it given what we see on the ground and given the composition of employment in the market.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Rich Anderson from SMBC is next.",
			"<strong>Richard Charles Anderson</strong>",
			"So back to the bad debt question. If you were to sort of magically flip a switch and you'd be back to 40 basis points bad debt like you'd see normally, would that recovery be less than the rent relief number that you -- gathered last year about $32 million. I'm wondering how much the rent relief overcompensated you or maybe under compensate you for the bad debt that you took on? I'm just trying to understand that math.",
			"<strong>Robert A. Garechana</strong>",
			"Yes. So -- the government -- you're right, the governmental rental relief in '22 was $32 million. You would have to get back to, call it, 40, 50 basis points normal, that's $1 million a month of bad debt. If you look at kind of the disclosure for Q1, we were averaging like probably around -- certainly in January and February, more like [$ 4 million]. So it's like a $3 million spread -- so you'd have to get $3 million times the 12 months or so is about where you'd be at, which would be a little bit more than what the governmental rental relief would be. But you're getting there if you got back to, call it, that $1 million a month right away. That's obviously not what's happening yet. We're hopeful that, that happens and the sooner the better from a growth perspective. Does that help, Rich?",
			"<strong>Richard Charles Anderson</strong>",
			"Yes, yes. That's great. And then my second question is, Michael, I think you mentioned you're running a 3.25% market rent growth at this point. If memory serves, I think you said your guidance presumed 3% market rent growth for 2023. And I know you guys are trying to be careful about overpromising having not updated guidance yet, and that's coming later. But it seems to me you're ahead of the schedule from a market rent growth, particularly at this point in the year, shouldn't 3.25% barring a major disruption from some sort of recession. Shouldn't that really be a maybe a significantly bigger number as you get into the heavy leasing season and maybe that will be another driving force to you upticking your guidance, just a better market rent growth trajectory than you expected? If you could comment on that, please.",
			"<strong>Michael L. Manelis</strong>",
			"Yes. I mean I think, Rich, you can look at that and say the 3.25% sequential build from January 1 is about where we peg where we should be of what a normal cycle is. The 3% for the full year, remember, you got to blend in what happens due in that first quarter and the fourth quarter. So when you put it all into the blender, could you be up at a 4%, 4.5% in the peak leasing season? Sure. And you still could average to the 3% for the full year. <br/>So I think I would just look at the trajectory that we see the sequential build of application volume and the sequential build of this net effective pricing trend is basically resulting in us being right on top of where we thought we would be from the blended rate growth, which is what manifests itself to the P&amp;L.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets.",
			"<strong>Bradley Barrett Heffern</strong>",
			"Circling back on bad debt. So it was 1.7% of revenue in the first quarter, excluding the assistance payments. But you obviously mentioned that it improved in March and April. So I'm curious if you can just compare the whatever leading-edge figure you have to that 1.7%.",
			"<strong>Robert A. Garechana</strong>",
			"Yes. So that would probably be -- the 1.7% would probably be something, call it, 20 basis points better, maybe a little bit more, maybe 30.",
			"<strong>Bradley Barrett Heffern</strong>",
			"Okay. Perfect. And then going back to next question. You gave the 3% employed by Big Tech in LA figure. I'm curious if you have the figures handy for the Bay Area and for Seattle and if there are any other markets like, I don't know, New York that have a larger number too.",
			"<strong>Mark J. Parrell</strong>",
			"Yes. I've got some numbers for you. I don't have the East Coast, but the Bay Area is about 14%. And Seattle is about 30%.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Next question comes from Haendel Juste from Mizuho.",
			"<strong>Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste</strong>",
			"A couple for me. I guess first question is can you provide the new and renewal numbers for March specifically? And where are you sending out renewal rates today for May? And what's the loss to lease in the portfolio today?",
			"<strong>Michael L. Manelis</strong>",
			"Yes. Okay. So let me just start with loss to lease. So we snapshot that on the 15th of every month. By April 15, we were at 3.4%, which basically compares to, I think we are 1.5% on January 15 again, trending in line with where you would have expected it to be. <br/>In terms of like the March, April, I will tell you both new lease and renewals are basically flat when you look at it sequentially. You look at the blended rate, and you can see that we're moving from a 3.8% in March to a 4.0% expected in April. So again, right in line with what we would think based on the sequential build heading into the peak leasing season. <br/>If I look forward to think about transactions that are on the books for May, so we have renewals on the books, we've got some expected move-ins for leases that just haven't started yet. Those are also trending in line with what you would expect, which you're starting to see that improvement kick into gear on new lease change and you got that consistency on renewal. In terms of the forward view on renewals, we've got quotes sitting out there for the next 90 days. I think I said in the prepared remarks, we really do expect a lot of consistency here.<br/>We're renewing about 55% to 60%. We don't see any reason not to expect that in the next several months going forward. We're achieving somewhere in this 5.5% to 6% achieved renewal rate increase each month. We don't see a significant change there. We have a lot of confidence in this renewal process. My expectation is we turn to corner to the second half of the year. We do expect to see a little bit of moderation on renewals, probably more like in that 4% to 5% range, which is just a function of the comp period and what we see as we return to more of a normal pricing trend.",
			"<strong>Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste</strong>",
			"Very helpful. Another question on, I guess, some of the charges in the quarter. It sounds like the property, legal and admin charges are tied to the eviction process, but can you comment on the other charges, the $5 million environment settlement and the $2 million data transformation project and if we should expect those in future quarters, too.",
			"<strong>Mark J. Parrell</strong>",
			"And I'll start. Bob will help here a little. The data transformation project is something we're working on. We mentioned this before in prior calls. It's a big data analytics project with an outside vendor. You can expect a couple of million dollars more there and then it should be at an end. <br/>All of our internal employee hires and all that, that's in our normal overhead load. So continuing costs are in the run rate of the business. The sort of discrete onetime sort of events are separately categorized, as we said on the Page 24 of the release. And I don't know, Bob, if you want to comment on the risk.",
			"<strong>Robert A. Garechana</strong>",
			"Yes. The other components are adjustments to various kind of regular course litigation reserves that we made during the quarter as we got more information and adjusted our outlook. So those are all case-by-case dependent and depend on facts and circumstances at the moment.",
			"<strong>Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste</strong>",
			"Got it. Got it. And one more question on cost. Is there any part of the property damage from the cost in California at the rain storms. Any part of that recoverable perhaps from insurance?",
			"<strong>Mark J. Parrell</strong>",
			"No, this all falls, it's Mark, below our deductible handouts. So this is all covered by us.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler.",
			"<strong>Alexander David Goldfarb</strong>",
			"So two questions. First, on the insurance, you guys mentioned that and we've heard from others that insurance has become more challenging, expensive, especially in like Florida and Texas. So 2 parts to this. In your experience, do you would expect that the insurance provider will rapidly adjust new capital come in and that this won't really be a problem? Or do you think that it's actually could give you some opportunities to buy deals where the existing owner can't get insurance on their property and therefore, provides you guys with some opportunity to buy some of those in some of the expansion markets.",
			"<strong>Mark J. Parrell</strong>",
			"It's Mark. It's a good question. The insurance market typically has, as you suggested, when you see costs go up as much as this capacity has gone up. We don't yet see that. And the difference now is that fixed income is a real alternative. I mean folks that are reinsurers can invest in a lot of different things. And the fixed income market and maybe even these beaten down equity values may be more interesting to them.<br/>So there's a little more competition for those reinsurance dollars that investment. So in the off-season here because we just renewed our policy program -- our property program last month, Alex, we're going to be out there looking for other capacity in other places because I'm not sure given the severity of this named windstorm risk that we're going to be able to find additional capacity for that risk. Now EQR doesn't have Florida exposure, and we don't have that risk, but it has impacted other spots in the market.<br/>And other folks have much larger increases than we had. Ours was about 20% on our property program. So I would say I would expect normally for the market to get bigger, I wonder this time how quickly that's going to occur, given concerns that these sort of wind storms, especially are going to be more continuous than they've been in the past and just alternatives that insurers have and reinsurers have to invest elsewhere. So hopefully, that's helpful.",
			"<strong>Alexander David Goldfarb</strong>",
			"That is. The second question is the tax deal that you did in Atlanta, you guys have previously spoken about the 421a is here in New York and the drag it cost to earnings when those tax incentives dried up -- or sorry, matured off -- burned off. Do you see similar with the Atlanta and in general, are you looking to do more tax deals or your preferences to shy away from them except where on a case-by-case basis.",
			"<strong>Mark J. Parrell</strong>",
			"Yes, a great question. We certainly like not to repeat things like that. You got to look at the IRR in the deal. You start with these elevated cash flows, you're getting a little bit better cap rate because of the fact that later on, you're going to be paying these higher taxes. So for us in year 8 or 9, taxes are going to go up and you're going to really have this flatten out. But it's not the order of magnitude of the 421a program. So -- and we also keep track, Alex, of these. So we're not allowing any 1 year to be overburdened.<br/>So we don't feel like we're robbing Peter to pay Paul as long as we're comfortable with our IRR. So as our overall IRR, we being paid upfront, for the cash flow growth flatness that will occur 8, 9, 10 years from now. And I think we feel like we were, and we'll do deals like that. <br/>And most of the new product is going to have stuff like this. So we'll also buy some stuff that's a little bit older. Alex and his team are looking at those kind of deals as well where you won't have that but if you have an older deal, remember, you're going to be putting in a lot more capital. So it's not possible to avoid some sort of cost here because if we bought something 10 years old that had fully stabilized taxes in Atlanta, it probably would require more capital, and that would affect the IRR. So we're going to look at the IRR and use that as our check on that.",
			"<strong>Alexander Brackenridge</strong>",
			"And in some cases, Alex, this is Alex. As the abatement burns off or when it burns off, some of the units might go to market. So you got to pick up there, too. So it's not all downside.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And Jamie Feldman from Wells Fargo.",
			"<strong>James Colin Feldman</strong>",
			"I guess just big picture to your comments on maybe assets come to market for investment. Your leverage tick lower in the quarter. It looks like you've been met -- this year, you plan to match fund acquisitions with dispositions. To the extent you want to put incremental capital to work beyond asset sales just because you see so much opportunity. Can you just talk about the sources of capital to do that, you're having conversations with potential JV partners? If so, what kind of capital looks interested? And then what would you be willing to do in terms of leverage? And how do you think about your liquidity position today for investment?",
			"<strong>Mark J. Parrell</strong>",
			"So first off, there isn't such a significant opportunity out there that it's worth using our precious leverage capacity or issuing a bunch of equity below what we think the intrinsic worth of the business is. So I haven't been presented yet with that issue. Talking to the Board, we're certainly willing to take leverage up. We have a stated leverage policy, Bob?",
			"<strong>Robert A. Garechana</strong>",
			"By 5 to 6x net debt to EBITDA.",
			"<strong>Mark J. Parrell</strong>",
			"Yes. And we're approaching 3x so into the 3x. So I would say to you that there are several billion dollars of capacity in the system to buy great assets at great prices using debt when and if we see those opportunities, and we're looking hard for those. We don't see them yet.<br/>But I'd start with debt. But certainly, the JV market is another source of capital. We're very aware of that. The private market continues to love the apartment industry, even if the public markets are being buffeted a little bit by some of these cross wins. So we're out there looking for other sources of capital for sure.",
			"<strong>James Colin Feldman</strong>",
			"And can you talk about the returns that private market is looking for. Are those sources of capital are looking for? How are they underwriting apartments today? And what kind of trends are they looking for?",
			"<strong>Alexander Brackenridge</strong>",
			"Generally, there -- this is Alex. Generally, they're looking for the same kind of return, a cap rate of, say, 5%, 5.25%, depending on the assets that we would see in the transactions market.",
			"<strong>James Colin Feldman</strong>",
			"Okay. And then finally, I mean, to your comments and everyone's comments, I mean, there's so much talk about supply. When you just think about the next 6 months, 9 months or 12 months, 24 months, like when do you think the supply chain really starts to kick in based on the delivery scale?",
			"<strong>Mark J. Parrell</strong>",
			"Just to make sure I understand the question. When do we think supply will start going down based on deliveries? I'm sorry, didn't near the end of that.",
			"<strong>James Colin Feldman</strong>",
			"No. I mean I know in your comments, you feel somewhat protected from supply based on where your assets are located. But clearly, a very large pipeline set to deliver over the next 2 years. When do you think that supply really starts to be felt nationally? It certainly doesn't feel (inaudible) several months.",
			"<strong>Mark J. Parrell</strong>",
			"I think you've got the stuff it's going to get completed. I would say you're looking more in like '25 and '26. I mean stuff you start now -- I mean, if you've got your capital stack and you're able to start, you're going to deliver. I mean, you may deliver a quarter late because of the supply chain, but you're going to deliver. So I think the starts Alex referred to, will impact '25's count will be lower and '26's count will be lower but stuff for this year and next, that's expected to deliver will deliver. And I think some of the numbers in some of the markets, some of which we're interested in, like Denver and Austin are really large. <br/>And that's a terrific opportunity for us to buy. And to sell some of these assets where we're overallocated in some of the coastal markets. And I think that's going to be an attractive play for us.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And John Kim from BMO Capital Markets.",
			"<strong>John P. Kim</strong>",
			"I realize unemployment remains pretty healthy. It seems like demand is going very well for you guys. There have been some reports of employers delaying start dates for new hires. And I'm wondering if you've seen any softness in demand as it pertains to the upcoming graduate pool?",
			"<strong>Michael L. Manelis</strong>",
			"John, this is Michael. I don't -- I haven't heard that. I mean I did hear a few kind of comments from prospects around what time they're looking for. So typically, they're showing uptake in tours. And these folks were thinking more like the June, July timeframe. There's definitely a little pause in the prospects decision-making process right now around, are there going to be more layoffs, will they actually get the offer to start when they want it. But it's nothing of a material nature because, again, our sequential build of application volumes, our foot traffic year-over-year, all of those things are trending in line with what we would say is a normal seasonal pattern. So we haven't seen anything like that.",
			"<strong>John P. Kim</strong>",
			"Okay. My second question is, I think, for Bob, but on the litigation reserve that you incurred this quarter, is this something that may be ongoing? And is this related to RealPage?",
			"<strong>Mark J. Parrell</strong>",
			"Yes, it's Mark. I'll take that. So being in a consumer-facing business, there's always some level of litigation costs. They're widely varying. There's no significant amount of RealPage related costs in there, but they are in there, but it's relatively small. The reason for that is that the case is at its early stages. And you should think about that going on for a longer period of time. <br/>They aren't resolved in weeks or months. It's more like years. But again, we feel very strongly about our position. We think these claims are without merit, and we're going to defend ourselves, and we continue to feel really confident in our prospects there. So there is some small amount, but it's small. Most of that just relates to just continuing legal costs from being in a customer-facing business in an industry that has regulation.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Next question comes from Adam Kramer from Morgan Stanley.",
			"<strong>Adam Kramer</strong>",
			"Yes, I just wanted to ask about this California storm damage kind of cost. Look, I appreciate kind of the disclosure around 1Q impacts. Wondering just on if there will be further impacts in particular, if you could kind of quantify maybe the 2Q impacts or any other impacts going forward?",
			"<strong>Robert A. Garechana</strong>",
			"Yes. Thanks, Adam. It's Bob. Our expectation is that there won't be anything material going forward into Q2 related to these specific storms. Obviously, if there's a different event, then we don't know. But as it relates to this, there's nothing material that's moving the numbers soon for Q2.",
			"<strong>Adam Kramer</strong>",
			"Great. And then just on thinking through occupancy and kind of the occupancy versus renewal, renewal kind of pushing renewals kind of trade off. Look, recognizing occupancy, there's some drivers there in terms of physical occupancy, right, kind of what's happening on the on the bad debt and eviction side. <br/>But just thinking through how was that kind of -- that trade-off that you guys going through, right, managing occupancy versus pushing renewals? How would that conversation maybe evolved from 4Q to 1Q to today? Is there a change in kind of how you're approaching that and how much you're kind of willing or able to push renewals?",
			"<strong>Michael L. Manelis</strong>",
			"Yes. Well, I think you could see just that sequential build that we have right now and the achieved renewal increase shows that we are pushing on that front. I mean every market has a different balance act that's going on between the trade-offs of occupancy and renewals. I mean for us, the preference clearly would be to continue to renew as many residents as possible because, one, we avoid the turn cost; and two, we avoid the vacancy loss with that. So you're seeing us do a little bit more negotiation across many of the markets right now. But again, we're well positioned, which gives us that confidence to keep kind of pushing on that rate in the marketplace that not only fuels the new lease change, but also helps the future months renewals as well.<br/>So I think this trade-off is constantly balanced. And honestly, we're looking at these markets every week going through that conversation now that we have the centralized renewal team, which is which way are we leaning.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And Linda Tsai from Jefferies.",
			"<strong>Linda Tsai</strong>",
			"I know you just emphasized IRR of individual deals, but the higher taxes and insurance occurring in the expansion markets, does this shift the attractiveness of these regions long term?",
			"<strong>Mark J. Parrell</strong>",
			"There's no riskless apartment market, and it's Mark. I'll start, and Alex may supplement it. I mean, if you're buying in some markets, you're going to have higher insurance costs, but maybe lower political risk. <br/>And then another market, you may have slightly higher political risk and a lot better resilience and maybe a better supply picture. Our whole investment thought process of being diversified is premised on the idea of kind of accepting these risks in small doses across the whole country and staying tied to these affluent renters so it doesn't change our mind. <br/>We just underwrite it and the deals will either work or they won't. I do think that some of the markets that have outperformed lately in the Sunbelt that have resilience challenges are really going to be pressed by these insurance costs. And frankly, maybe even the availability of financing if insurance is unavailable at some of the issue lenders are very sensitive to. But from our point of view, I mean, we're just going to run the numbers. I think these markets continue to have other subjective factors that are valuable to us. And I think they're going to remain investable the ones that we're interested in, for sure.",
			"<strong>Linda Tsai</strong>",
			"And then just on the strength you're seeing in New York and Atlanta. Could you talk about that a little more?",
			"<strong>Michael L. Manelis</strong>",
			"Yes. I mean -- this is Michael. I said in the prepared remarks, I mean, New York, the strength is really kind of widespread across all of the submarkets where you have good demand, you have pricing power, you have the sequential build of the demand and rents moving up with really strong kind of results, both on the retention as well as the achieved renewal increase. In Atlanta, I think right now, relative to our expectations, we feel really good. We're not having that like direct supply pressure on us.<br/>We're not seeing kind of heavy use of concessions in our portfolio, and we have demand. And even the deals that we're looking at, one that we have to go through the lease-up or finish the lease-up on, we got a lot of confidence in the velocity, the weekly velocity of application volume there that they're going to perform really well.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Omotayo Okusanya from Credit Suisse.",
			"<strong>Omotayo Tejamude Okusanya</strong>",
			"Yes. On just capital recycling and the updated guidance there. I get it of buying assets that higher cap rates and selling us at a lower cap rate and kind of creating value that way. But I'm curious with your implied cap at like 6% at this point, according to our math, you did make some comments earlier on about kind of development starts slowing because that development doesn't tend to allow. How do you kind of think about that on the other side of the story, which is the acquisition side, are still -- is the idea still things are not going to be able to kind of pencil out for a while? And unless you're kind of matching asset sales versus acquisitions, you don't expect to kind of be doing much out there on the acquisition side as well?",
			"<strong>Alexander Brackenridge</strong>",
			"It's really -- as you said -- Tayo, this is Alex, about matching the sales and the acquisition. So we keep track of that. We don't get ahead of ourselves on either side and just match them up and it's a neutral bet, but we feel like we're accomplishing our goal of diversifying the footprint.",
			"<strong>Omotayo Tejamude Okusanya</strong>",
			"And the focus from an acquisition perspective remains in your newer markets rather than some of the more established markets.",
			"<strong>Alexander Brackenridge</strong>",
			"Quiet primarily, but also in the sub of our established markets. And as we've talked about, being opportunistic, there may be opportunities that come up. There's more dislocation that are appealing anywhere and we would chase those.",
			"<strong>Omotayo Tejamude Okusanya</strong>",
			"Got you. Okay. That's helpful. Would there be any interest in doing something in regards to office to resi conversion from your end or just the development risk and everything is just way too great for you?",
			"<strong>Mark J. Parrell</strong>",
			"Well, I'm going to split it up because there's the urban conversion of these office buildings that are really giant 1-block floor plates. It's very challenging in urban locations to take a property on LaSalle Street in Chicago or in Midtown Manhattan, it spans a block and doesn't have a lot of windows relative to the total floor space, doesn't have a lot of plumbing fixtures. There's been work done by engineering firms in Boston, for example, on this. And there's relatively few of these buildings -- these large buildings that are going to work as repositioning plays. They may work if the building isn't there anymore, but they're just taking that building and some of our reengineering it is going to be tough.<br/>In the suburbs, you may -- and this has been common in the Bay Area and in suburban Washington. You may scrape an office park and build apartments there. And we've been involved in those sort of plays, but those are different altogether because you're not reusing the building. So I think reusing an office building is tough in an urban situation just because of the need for plumbing fixtures in the unit and the need for windows that these larger office buildings just don't allow very well. But I would say, as urban owners, we'd like to see the central business district -- office districts thrive. I mean they pay taxes that support transit, that support public safety, we want those to be repositioned. <br/>It will just take more time and likely be more costly and extensive than some observers seem to think. I just don't think you can snap your finger and take a 4-year-old office building and turn it into a livable awesome apartment building in the center of whether it's Manhattan or the center of Los Angeles. So we'll kind of play wait-and-see on that, but urban repositionings for us are not likely in place.",
			"<strong>Alexander Brackenridge</strong>",
			"And in New York, downtown where it was done a lot. That was on the back of a tax abatement that since expired. The 421g was specifically to promote the conversion. So it doesn't happen easily and it does need -- it generally does need public policy support.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And our next question comes from Josh Dennerlein from Bank of America.",
			"<strong>Joshua Dennerlein</strong>",
			"I just wanted to touch base on the new lease change in April relative to 1Q. It looks like it kind of stepped up 30 basis points. How does that compare to kind of the typical acceleration in April versus 1Q?",
			"<strong>Michael L. Manelis</strong>",
			"I don't know if I looked historically back, I will tell you it's sitting right on top of what we modeled at the beginning of the year, which is what we would say more like a 2019, 2018 kind of curve and expectation. Some of this just has to do with the timing of who moved out? What was their previous lease? So when I look at the 30 basis points growth, I would just tell you any time you look at these statistics or these metrics on such a short time period of time, it does create some volatility with it. So we tend to look at this over the longer stretch. And right now, I've said this a couple of that, we're sitting right where we kind of modeled for the year and write what we would expect based on just the normal sequential build.",
			"<strong>Joshua Dennerlein</strong>",
			"Okay. It sounds like concessions use picked up in March and April in Yale in San Francisco. If you stripped out those 2 markets, how is kind of new lease rate trending?",
			"<strong>Michael L. Manelis</strong>",
			"I think the impact on the overall portfolio was like 20 or 30 basis points on the net effective, like new lease change. So if you just pulled out those 2 markets with the heavy concession use, I think that was what the impact was.",
			"<strong>Joshua Dennerlein</strong>",
			"Okay. And then just digging down into same-store expenses, I don't think we've touched on the other on-site operating expenses on the call. I think that's where kind of people kind of use flow through for the evictions. What's kind of the expectation in that line item going into 2Q, just given the move-outs?",
			"<strong>Robert A. Garechana</strong>",
			"Yes. Josh, it's Bob. Our expectation is that, that could be pretty bumpy because -- if you think about the expense, the expense is really in advance, oftentimes is in advance of the actual move-out. So it depends on how quickly and how fast the cases get filed, which we've made a good amount of progress faster than what we thought in the first quarter. <br/>We'll have some go into the second quarter. That line item is normally a line item that barely grows for us. And so it will be bumpy because of this elevated activity, but it will be lumpy. So just expect it to be kind of grow above trend relative to history and be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, hopefully tailing off as we get to the back end of the year.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And there's no further questions in the queue. I'll turn the call back over to Mark for additional and closing remarks. Please go ahead.",
			"<strong>Mark J. Parrell</strong>",
			"All right. Well, thank you all for your time on the call today and for your interest in Equity Residential. Good day.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Everyone else has left the call. This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

			"<strong>Adam Smith</strong>",
			"Good morning, and thank you for joining American Tower's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. We have posted a presentation, which we will refer to throughout our prepared remarks under the Investor Relations tab of our website, www.americantower.com.<br/>On this morning's call, Tom Bartlett, our President and CEO, will provide an update on our U.S. tower and data center businesses.

After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. <br/>Before we begin, I'll remind you that our comments will contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding future growth, including our 2023 outlook, capital allocation and future operating performance. Our collections expectations associated with Vodafone Idea in India, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. <br/>You should be aware that certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Such factors include the risk factors set forth in this morning's earnings press release, those set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and in other filings we make with the SEC. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. <br/>With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.",
			"<strong>Thomas A. Bartlett</strong>",
			"Thanks, Adam, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. As is customary for our first quarter call, my comments today will focus on our U.S. business, which is principally comprised of our tower and data center platforms, which made up 55%of our consolidated property revenue and 64% of our property operating profit in the first quarter of 2023. <br/>With regard to our tower platform, the secular tailwinds that have supported outstanding growth over the last 2 decades remain consistent. Every year, U.S. wireless subscribers consume more mobile data through a growing number of devices and applications requiring faster speeds and lower latency performance. As a result of the increasing levels of data being consumed, our customers are deploying more equipment on our towers to meet that demand. <br/>In addition, and more than ever before, our customers are utilizing multiple bands of spectrum to deliver those high-quality, ubiquitous levels of service. In 2022, U.S. carriers deployed around $40 billion in network capital to provide nationwide 5G services on mid-band spectrum. This record level of activity is reflective of the first major wave of the typical investment cycles we've seen over the last 20 years, during which carriers amend existing sites to provide initial coverage and capacity with the new technology and harvest benefits from core network enhancements and spectral efficiencies.<br/>In previous cycles, these initial peaks have typically been followed by periods of moderation in overall spending, driven in part by reductions in spend on core upgrades, fiber and other infrastructure assets. However, we've historically seen tower spend remain in focus as our customers look to support continuous growth in mobile data consumption and provide market-leading network quality and reliability. And we would expect more of the same over the 5G cycle.<br/>In 2023, while we're still in the relatively early stages of the overall 5G rollout, we continue to see customers making significant investments into their networks as part of their broader coverage initiatives, having yet to invest in densification at scale. These investments into adding and modifying equipment on our sites, which we've monetized to our MLAs, is driving 5.6% organic growth in Q1 or nearly 7%, absent the impacts of Sprint churn, our strongest quarter since Q1 of 2020 and for the full year, we expect $220 million in year-over-year growth contributions from colocations and amendments, a record for our U.S. business.<br/>Looking out over the next several years, we see an environment that is supportive of continued strong performance in the U.S. as the 5G investment cycle progresses and densification occurs. In American Tower, we've underwritten this expectation into the comprehensive MLAs that underpin our expectation to deliver average annual organic growth of at least 5% or 6% excluding the Sprint churn over the next 5 years, which closely mirrors the 6.2% average organic growth we experienced between 2016 and 2020.<br/>Further, industry estimates suggest total monthly mobile data consumption that will require increased speed and lower latency is set to grow at a compounded annual rate of above 20% over the next 5 years, which we expect to be driven by continuous increases in mobile network utility, irrespective of potential impacts from any one category of new applications.<br/>As a result, we believe our customers' networks will need to provide at least 2x the network capacity they have today in 3 to 4 years or roughly 3x today's capacity as we approach the end of the decade.<br/>Over time, we expect our customers to meet this demand through continued network upgrade and densification initiatives, spectrum refarming and the deployment of 5G on new spectrum. In this context, we believe our portfolio of over 43,000 sites is optimally positioned to serve our customers across the balance of the 5G cycle with significant capacity to accommodate additional equipment and new tenancies even beyond what's been contractually locked in today.<br/>As we've done historically, we anticipate leveraging our best-in-class internal processes to generate incremental efficiency in the business and higher levels of service for our customers with both resulting in increasing conversion of our top line growth to AFFO. <br/>Through a combination of organic growth and M&amp;A, we've added nearly $2.4 billion in annual property revenues to our U.S. and Canada segment since 2014, paired with less than $60 million in incremental SG&amp;A expense or roughly 2% of the corresponding revenue growth. This prudent approach to cost management and operational efficiency has helped to drive operating profit margin expansion in the segment by roughly 400 basis points over the period.<br/>Going forward, given the benefits of our established scale, demonstrated ability to maximize the operating leverage potential inherent to our model and concerted efforts to further drive cost efficiencies at every level of the organization, we see a tremendous opportunity for capacity utilization in our existing assets to drive high-margin growth and expanding returns on invested capital as the 5G landscape continues to mature.<br/>Now with respect to our CoreSite U.S. data center platform, we are equally excited about the prospects for value creation. Increasingly complex digital business demands require enhanced infrastructure performance and flexibility. CoreSite serves as an optimal nexus for the cloud service providers, service integrators, networks and enterprise customers interoperate to propel their business initiatives forward.<br/>We continue to see customers landing and expanding with CoreSite because it provides native access to key cloud service platforms and a diverse ecosystem, which allows them to serve their customers in a way that is flexible, scalable and it drives growth and efficiency in their businesses. This is reflected in the continued strength of CoreSite's leasing results, interconnection growth driven by both existing customers and new logos, as well as the ability to drive pricing, solid renewal rates and generate industry-leading returns.<br/>We also recognize that we're still in the early stages of a broader digital transformation and movement. Each year, data center workloads and compute instances continue to grow at a rate of approximately 12% in the vast majority of all new IT architectures deployed into cloud and hybrid environments that CoreSite is uniquely positioned to support.<br/>Additionally, we continue to expect to generate long-term growth from enterprise digital transformations and IT hybridization as organizations face workload management challenges that require the operational optionality, agility and critical interconnection capabilities that our CoreSite data center platform offers.<br/>Importantly, the absorption of this type of demand drives incremental value to our interconnection ecosystem and further builds on the momentum behind the CoreSite flywheel and the value we can provide our customers. So we see a long tail of opportunity to continue growing and scaling our campuses, and we have the added benefit of being able to prudently select opportunities that are accretive to our ecosystem.<br/>As a result, we'll continue to invest cash flows generated in the data center segment back into the business, provide our customers incremental confidence in a long runway for growth with CoreSite and generate highly attractive returns.<br/>Meanwhile, our teams continue working to develop solutions that leverage our combined communications real estate platforms to position American Tower as a leading infrastructure provider for the networks of the future and create incremental value for our customers and shareholders alike.<br/>In summary, our foundational U.S. tower and data center platforms are set to deliver continued growth and strong returns. We believe that the long-term secular tailwinds, the differentiated high-quality nature of both our U.S. tower portfolio and our data center interconnection platform, the value proposition they represent for our customers and the seasoned high talented teams managing them uniquely positions American Tower to create significant incremental value for the industry and our shareholders for many years to come.<br/>With that, I'll hand the call over to Rod to discuss our Q1 results and expectations for the balance of the year. Rod?",
			"<strong>Rodney M. Smith</strong>",
			"Thanks, Tom. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. As you saw in our press release, we are off to a solid start to the year with performance exceeding our initial expectations across many of our key metrics.<br/>Before diving into the results and the revised outlook for 2023, I'll start with a few highlights from the quarter. First, despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility, strong demand trends continue to drive favorable leasing and growth across our global footprint, which is a testament to the resiliency and stability of our business.<br/>In Q1, we posted consolidated organic tenant billings growth of over 6%, our highest rate since 2017 and an over 300 basis point acceleration as compared to Q1 of 2022. This includes growth through colocations and amendments of over 5%, our highest in 3 years, as carriers continue to leverage our leading macro tower portfolio to aggressively roll out their networks to meet customer demand.<br/>Organic leasing growth was further complemented by another quarter of strong new build volumes as we continue to leverage our scale and capabilities to attract accretive development opportunities from our leading customers across our international business.<br/>Finally, we had another record quarter of leasing from CoreSite, continuing the momentum from what was a record-breaking 2022 and exceeding our initial underwriting plan.<br/>Complementing our solid top line trends, our focus on cost management, combined with the inherent operating leverage in the tower model, drove margin expansion of approximately 270 basis points as compared to Q1 of last year to 63.7%, with the benefits being more noticeable given the absence of material M&amp;A.<br/>Going forward, we'll continue to manage our business with cost discipline, maximizing the profitability of our strong reoccurring organic growth profile. <br/>Next, we access the debt capital markets, successfully issuing $1.5 billion in unsecured notes and $1.3 billion in secured notes at attractive terms. Proceeds from these offerings more than cover our Q1 maturities and the remainder, together with the proceeds from various strategic initiatives, including the sale of the Mexico Fiber business, were used to pay down floating rate debt. As a result, we've reduced our floating balance by nearly $800 million year-to-date, now representing slightly over 20% of our debt structure.<br/>We'll continue to evaluate opportunities to further manage this balance over the course of the year. Finally, we continue to have constructive discussions with potential investors as we assess strategic options for our India business. We remain focused on executing an outcome that maximizes value and optimizes our global portfolio mix and the risk-adjusted return profile for American Tower and its stakeholders.<br/>As we move forward, we will keep our investors informed of any new developments. <br/>With that, please turn to Slide 6, and I'll review our property revenue and organic tenant billings growth for the quarter. As you could see, Q1 consolidated property revenue growth was over 4% and approximately 7% on an FX-neutral basis over the prior year period. This included U.S. and Canada property revenue growth of over 4%, international growth of over 3% or nearly 9%, excluding the impacts of currency fluctuations, and approximately 10% growth in our U.S. data center business.<br/>In the quarter, we benefited from accelerated decommissioning-related settlements in Latin America, totaling approximately $39 million, partially offset by Vodafone Idea or VIL, revenue reserves of approximately $33 million, representing a modest improvement to payment trends as compared to the second half of 2022.<br/>Moving to the right side of the slide, organic tenant billings growth was a significant contributor to our overall revenue growth, standing at 6.4% on a consolidated basis, which as I mentioned, was our highest quarter since Q3 of 2017.<br/>In our U.S. and Canada segment, organic tenant billings growth was 5.6% and nearly 7% absent Sprint-related churn, including a record quarter of colocation and amendment growth contributions of nearly $60 million, a nearly 65% increase as compared to the growth reported in Q1 of 2022.<br/>Growth modestly exceeded our expectations, driven by some delays in churn, which we still anticipate to occur in the year and, to a lesser extent, new business upside. Similarly, our international operations experienced improvements across nearly all reported segments, generating organic tenant billings growth of 7.5% and an over 180 basis point acceleration from Q4 of 2022, which includes the benefits of CPI-linked escalator commencements across various contracts. <br/>Africa generated its highest quarter on record with organic tenant billings growth of 12.1%, including escalator contributions of over 10% and a continuation of solid new business of nearly 7%. Growth in the quarter benefited from some delays in previously communicated carrier consolidation-driven churn, which we still expect to occur in the year.<br/>Turning to Europe, we saw a growth of 8.2% including over 6% from escalations, demonstrating our ability to monetize on CPI-linked escalators across the vast majority of our portfolio in the region.<br/>In Latin America, we saw a growth of 6.1%, which includes relatively consistent escalator and new business growth, partially offset by the continued elevated churn, as we've highlighted on past calls. Churn in the quarter was favorable relative to our initial expectations as the decommissioning events have been slightly delayed to later in the year.<br/>Lastly, in Asia Pacific, we saw a growth of 3.4%, demonstrating steady improvement over the past 3 quarters. This growth acceleration was mainly driven by colocation and amendment contributions as carriers ramp up 5G deployments. Organic tenant billings growth was further complemented by the construction of over 1,300 sites in the quarter, representing our 11th consecutive quarter of exceeding 1,000 sites, primarily in Africa and Asia Pacific, as carriers continue to invest in their network coverage and densification needs across the regions.<br/>Initial returns remained solidly in the double digits with Q1 constructed sites yielding nearly 14% on day 1. <br/>Turning to Slide 7. Adjusted EBITDA grew nearly 9% to approximately $1.8 billion or nearly 10% on an FX-neutral basis for the quarter. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, adjusted EBITDA margin demonstrated an approximately 270 basis point improvement year-over-year to 63.7% and still an over 190 basis point improvement when normalizing both periods of VIL-related revenue and bad debt reserves in India. This margin expansion was achieved through a continued focus on cost controls, allowing for approximately 100% conversion of revenue to adjusted EBITDA growth. Again, on a normalized VIL basis and driving cash, SG&amp;A as a percent of total property revenue down by approximately 50 basis points year-over-year to approximately 7.1% for the quarter.<br/>Moving to the right side of the slide, attributable AFFO growth was 1.5%. While roughly flat on a per share basis, which includes financing cost headwinds of around 7.5% and 9.5% against attributable AFFO and attributable AFFO per share growth, respectively, primarily driven by the rise in rates over the past year.<br/>Let's now turn to our revised full year outlook. As mentioned earlier, we had a strong first quarter, outperforming our initial expectations across the majority of our key metrics. While we are excited about the results to date and the sustainable demand trends that underpinned our performance, we have largely kept core and full year assumptions consistent to our prior guide, given our early position in the year and some of the timing benefits I alluded to earlier. This approach for our Q1 guidance is relatively consistent to past years. This also includes our assumptions around VIL-related revenue reserves, which we've held at $75 million for the year.<br/>As noted earlier, we did record approximately $33 million in VIL reserves in Q1 with the guide applying an improvement for the duration of the year, notably in the back half. This assumption is supported by certain factors that we've considered in our risk assessment, including the customers' contractual obligations for 2023, our latest conversations with VIL management, where they've committed to meet these contractual obligations, and a demonstrated improvement in payments by the customer in Q1 relative to the second half of 2022.<br/>Key updates to our revised outlook includes the impacts from the recent sale of the fiber business in Mexico, together with the upsides from FX derived using our standard methodology and several small adjustments below EBITDA at the attributable AFFO level.<br/>With that, let's dive into the numbers. Turning to Slide 8. We are reducing our expectations for property revenue by approximately $20 million versus our prior outlook, driven by $45 million related to the sale of the fiber business in Mexico, partially offset by $25 million associated with the positive impacts of FX.<br/>Moving to Slide 9. We are reiterating our prior outlook expectations for organic tenant billings growth across our regions, and we'll continue to assess the positive momentum coming from our strong first quarter as we work further into the year.<br/>Moving on to Slide 10. We are reiterating our adjusted EBITDA outlook with a decline of approximately $25 million related to the Mexico Fiber sale, offset by $25 million from positive impacts of FX. <br/>Turning to Slide 11. We are raising our expectations for AFFO attributable to common stockholders by $20 million at the midpoint and approximately $0.05 on a per share basis, moving the midpoint to $9.65 per share. Updates to our expectations, aside from FX, include the cash adjusted EBITDA reduction driven by the Mexico Fiber sale, offset by favorable net interest in part due to the use of the sale proceeds to pay down debt and some cash tax savings.<br/>On an isolated basis, the Mexico Fiber sale resulted in a $15 million decline to attributable AFFO as compared to our prior outlook midpoint.<br/>Moving on to Slide 12. I'll review our balance sheet and capital allocation priorities for 2023. Beginning on the left side of the slide, our capital allocation priorities for 2023 remain consistent with our prior outlook, which includes approximately $3 billion towards our common dividend, subject to Board approval, representing 10% growth year-over-year on a per share basis.<br/>In addition, our CapEx outlook midpoints remain unchanged across all categories and support our initial plans to construct approximately 4,000 new sites across our international footprint.<br/>Moving to the right side of the slide. And as I highlighted earlier, we further strengthened our investment-grade balance sheet in the first 3 months of the year, extending our average maturity profile to nearly 6 years while reducing our floating rate debt balance to slightly over 20%. Additionally, we closed the quarter with net leverage of approximately 5.2x, well on track towards our deleveraging target of 3 to 5x.<br/>Consistent with our past remarks, we remain focused on driving shareholder value through our growing dividend and accretive CapEx program while strengthening our balance sheet through deleveraging, maximizing liquidity, managing a diverse pool of capital sources and an ongoing assessment of market conditions to potentially further term out floating rate debt and extend our maturity profile.<br/>Turning to Slide 13 and in summary. Q1 was another strong quarter across our business with incremental steps taken towards strengthening our balance sheet. Underpinned by sustained demand trends across our global footprint, our leading portfolio of communications infrastructure assets generated accelerating leasing growth, while our capabilities as an operator and partner continue to afford us opportunities to deploy accretive capital to its high-yielding development projects.<br/>We believe we are well positioned to drive compelling growth, supported by attractive secular trends across our global footprint and deliver solid returns to our shareholders over the long term.<br/>With that, operator, we can open the line for questions.",

			"<strong>Brett Joseph Feldman</strong>",
			"I was hoping I can ask about some background on the sale of the Mexican fiber asset. What led to that? Was that something you were actively shopping? Or was there an inbound that came there? And then if we maybe just take a higher-level approach to this, you gave us an update you're considering and evaluating a potential equity sale in the India business. You just sold a piece of your Mexican business. Are you undertaking a broader portfolio rationalization strategy? And if that is the case or even if it was just India, where you would pull some additional proceeds in, how do we think about applying those proceeds especially now that you're getting close to the high end of your target leverage range?",
			"<strong>Thomas A. Bartlett</strong>",
			"Yes. Brett, I'll start, and Rod can also obviously add on here. We look at every one of our assets in our markets repeatedly. And continually, we're looking at where are the best rates of return that we can drive, are there better places for us to reallocate capital. And so this is -- it's an ongoing process that we do internally.<br/>We also do it with our Board every year as well. And the business that we've had in -- the fiber business that we've had in Mexico, we've had for several years, was really part of our kind of initial innovation and platform extension approach. And the piece of that particular business was just a business that we couldn't generate the kinds of returns on that we had expected. And we felt that it would be a better -- and could be in better hands with somebody who had broader scale in the marketplace.<br/>And so as a result of our kind of ongoing review, it was a business that we've actively marketed over the last several months. And this is consistent with how we're thinking about even a market like India, as we've talked about in the past. It goes through that same kind of disciplined approach that we have. And we look at, okay, in each given market, again, like India, is there a better place to be able to reallocate some of that capital or invest in other products and services.<br/>And so that's the process that we're going through right now, and Rod and I talked about it on the last call with you all. And we'll look to, as we did with the fiber, I mean, our goal from a balance sheet perspective is to delever, as we've talked about right now, and we use those proceeds from the fiber sale to do just that.<br/>And we will continue to look at kind of delevering the balance sheet really over the next 12 to 18 months until we get it to a spot that we're really comfortable with.",
			"<strong>Rodney M. Smith</strong>",
			"Brett, if I could just add a couple of points there. Thanks for the question. You see in our quarterly numbers here, we got our leverage down to 5.2%. And of course, as Tom said, we did use the proceeds from the fiber business to pay down debt. Not just to delever, but to actually reduce our exposure to floating rate debt, which we did, and we're down around that 20% number.<br/>And that really shows our commitment to our investment-grade balance sheet in this environment, looking to delever, that's definitely top of the list when it comes to capital allocation once you get beyond paying the dividend and the dividend growth that we have.<br/>And we'll continue to focus on delevering the business until we get down within our target range of 3 to 5x. And we're also continuing to focus on reducing our exposure to floating rate debt. So we're within our policy now right at about 20%. But we're going to be looking at that and working to try to reduce that exposure on the floating rate side even more than that in the coming quarter. So you'll see us pretty active in that space.",
			"<strong>Brett Joseph Feldman</strong>",
			"Great. If you don't mind as a quick follow-up question. I mean, just being at 5.2x, which is so close to the high end of your range. It doesn't seem like it would take 12 to 18 months to get into that target range. And so is the right interpretation of that statement to say that in this environment, all things being equal, you would likely just continue to delever and particularly to pay down floating rate debt absent something that's highly compelling, meaning you may drift below 5x and closer to 3, if that's just the case?",
			"<strong>Thomas A. Bartlett</strong>",
			"Absolutely right. You're exactly right. And now whether we go back down to 3x, it could be a bit of a stretch. But clearly, we want to get sub-5. And as Rod said, we really do want to lessen the exposure to the floating rate debt that we have on the balance sheet.",
			"<strong>Rodney M. Smith</strong>",
			"One thing, Brett, that I'll just alert you to is don't be surprised if you see the 5 float back up a little bit, even maybe a 5, 3 in the coming quarters before you see it trending back down. That will just be a function of kind of where our EBITDA -- our quarterly annualized EBITDA might end up landing.<br/>But that should not make you think that our commitment to delevering isn't as strong as we're suggesting it is. Because it is, but you may see it flow back up just a touch before you see it come back down.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"We'll go next to the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.",
			"<strong>Landon Hoffman Park</strong>",
			"This is Landon Park on for Simon. I'm wondering if we can start on the data center side. You mentioned another record bookings quarter for CoreSite. Can you maybe provide any more color there in terms of what you're seeing in the market and where that demand is coming from? And on the data center side, can you give us an update on your edge data center project that you were trying to get built out this year to start scaling on that front?",
			"<strong>Thomas A. Bartlett</strong>",
			"Yes, sure. Let me start, and then Rod, you can continue or can add to it. It's a continuation of what we saw in 2022. I mean, the demand from -- for the kind of the digital infrastructure that we have just continues to be strong throughout the country. And it's a really nice balance between enterprise accounts, between operators as well as the cloud. So the pipeline remains really healthy, and we've been able and have taken advantage of the opportunity to capture some strong pricing actions throughout the year, particularly as we really continue to drive all the interconnection growth.<br/>So we're really pleased with what the team has done, with the types of business that they've generated, and it really resulted again in a really strong Q1, and we continue to have really strong expectations for the business going forward. With regards to kind of all of the edge work, we continue to work internally on identifying particular locations where we can actually drive 1 meg or 2 meg of power. We have a number of sites that are shovel-ready at this point, and we're looking to move on them<br/>We continue to have conversations with all the service operators as well as the hyperscalers and all the cloud players to continue to move forward and figure out that value proposition that we think can be a profitable one for all of us. <br/>And so as we've said, it's still early stages of it, but we continue to remain really excited about the ultimate opportunity.",
			"<strong>Landon Hoffman Park</strong>",
			"And just 1 follow-up on that. Where are you at in terms of the design phase for that sort of edge data center that you guys were hoping, I think, to design this year and something that could be scaled relatively easy while going forward?",
			"<strong>Thomas A. Bartlett</strong>",
			"From a design and engineering perspective, we really have the specs really well laid out such that, as I said before, we're shovel-ready on a couple of locations to start to deploy it. And so the teams know exactly what it's going to look like, have identified who the vendors are that are going to be providing a lot of the resources and pieces of it. And so we're really far along on the overall design.",

			"Can we follow up on Brett's question a little bit on the Mexico Fiber sale. Let's go deeper into what lessons that you learned there. I think you were hoping to see some small cell, but is it just that the fiber business is dramatically different than the tower business and small cells weren't playing. But what specifically did you learn? And I got a U.S. question.",
			"<strong>Thomas A. Bartlett</strong>",
			"Rick, it's consistent with some of the experiences candidly that we've had in the past in the business, and we thought we might be able to do things differently and unique. That particular asset came with tens of thousands of sites in Mexico City, which was also very interesting to it and remains very interesting to us, and we still have the right to those particular assets as our customers deploy and densify in Region IX or in Mexico City itself.<br/>But what we continue to learn on the retail side, just how difficult it is to be able to provision circuits and make money providing Lit services to enterprise accounts and then just how competitive it is. And the SLAs that go along with them, how difficult it is to be able to maintain them in a very profitable manner. There's a tremendous amount of competition in the marketplace. And so as a result, it just makes sense for us to put those particular capabilities in the hands of somebody that just does that 24/7.<br/>And hopefully, they will find more success there. But it's consistent with what we see in the fiber business in all of our markets, including the U.S., where we think that there's really an opportunity for fiber is when you're bringing it to the tower. That's kind of a slam dunk for us because that's obviously improving the capability and the capacity of a particular site. So when we start to get into the retail aspects of it, it's just such a competitive, capital intensive, low margin opportunity that it just made sense for us to move out of it.",
			"<strong>Richard Hamilton Prentiss</strong>",
			"Yes. In this debt environment, good to reduce your floating rate and save some interest. On the U.S. side, can you update us as far as in aggregate what kind of percent of your towers do you think have been touched with mid-band spectrum by the carriers? And we've heard a lot of talk that private networks are going slowly, but starting to ramp, but that some of the carriers are wanting to see private networks before we get to the edge. So just trying to gauge in the U.S. where we're at as far as mid-band touches and what you're seeing on private networks?",
			"<strong>Thomas A. Bartlett</strong>",
			"Yes. I mean, Rick, it still is in that kind of that 50% range. Some are a bit higher, some are a bit lower. But in the aggregate, it's at that 50% range, I think, that have been touched. Again, it's largely been coverage. There are some pockets of densification going on, still largely amendment-driven, if you will, in terms of getting that ubiquitous coverage on a nationwide basis.<br/>So the carriers all remain active. And as Rod mentioned, the overall capital spend, we expect it to be lower in '23 versus '22. But as you well know, our comprehensive MLAs really protect us from that type of volatility, if you will. <br/>And so while the carriers may spend at different levels and on a consolidated basis, slowed down a bit as was -- as would be expected in '23. We really are protected from that. On the private side, yes, there is a lot more dialogue going on candidly relative to private networks. I mean I wouldn't say it's a surge of deployments, but I do see our sales teams entering into different types of conversations with carriers, enterprises, looking at deploying kind of private 5G types of networks.<br/>We have some that we're experimenting with and deploying. I think there's more to come on that. But clearly, 5G, I think, plays a -- will play a significant role in developing that aspect of the market.",

			"Just following up on the domestic leasing environment. Curious how much of the leasing strength is coming from outside of the big 3 national wireless carriers? And what's the sensitivity to performance, both for '23 and as you look out to your multiyear guidance, if that activity from these others, which could include DISH, were to significantly increase or significantly decrease.<br/>And then if I could just throw in a second question. The common theme from some of the market-by-market commentary was the delay of churn. And so just curious if there's more to unpack in what's causing those delays in certain markets. And if those delays should help the '23 outlook and just be something we should be considerate of in terms of a possible headwind for part of 2024?",
			"<strong>Rodney M. Smith</strong>",
			"Michael, thanks for joining, and thanks for the question. We've talked about in the past, we are seeing an acceleration in the leasing environment in the U.S. in terms of our numbers and specifically the incremental revenue that we're seeing from new business coming from colocations and amendment. So we had a really strong quarter in Q1 in the U.S. We booked about $60 million of incremental colocation amendment revenue, that's well on track to achieve our $220 million target for the year, which is a nice step-up over last year, which was about $150 million.<br/>So that's the acceleration that we're seeing. That is primarily coming from the primary carriers, the big 3 certainly. And DISH is also a contributor in that. And I think you know and most everyone on the call knows that we have holistic deals with the carriers in the U.S. environment. So not that we'll go through any specifics with how they work carrier by carrier, but what it does is it has our revenue contracted in there. So we have about 90% of our revenue and revenue growth for this year fully contracted, and there's no variability in that.<br/>So we feel really good about that. And then when you look at the long-term going out through 2027, you've heard us talk about that 5% on average OTBG in the U.S. We have about 75% visibility out over that long period of time of the underlying revenue as covered for revenue growth. So we feel really good about that. But the vast majority of that activity is the big 3 plus DISH.<br/>Certainly, we have kind of this other category with some broadcasters, some local independent radio companies and other people that use our towers like government agencies. And they always contribute a piece there, and they're kind of in the range that they've always been at. But the vast majority really is the big guys in the U.S.<br/>When you think about churn, we did have delays in churn, which helped support our growth rates for the quarter. So we're up to about 6.4%. Our churn came in at about 3.4% for the quarter. And the places where it's noticeable, a slight improvement in the U.S. because of churn, but that's not the biggest piece. It's probably more dropping down into Latin America.<br/>Within our overall guide for Latin America, we had 8 percentage points in for churn. And that is primarily coming from 2 big carriers: Telefonica, which everyone knows what's happening with Telefonica in Mexico as well as Oi down in Brazil. Oi represents about 2% within that 8%. And what's happening is just the delay. So we fully expect the churn for the Telefonica churn as well as the Oi churn to kind of catch up here during the year. That's why you're not seeing a change to our organic tenant billings outlook for the full year. So we do expect to kind of catch up with that.<br/>So we'll take the positive benefits for Q1, and we're still kind of being realistic and maybe a little conservative in terms of keeping our organic tenant billings growth consistent. But that's really where it is. We also have elevated churn in Africa with Cell C down in South Africa and even AirtelTigo over in Ghana. And again, we're not changing our full year outlook.

And then maybe to dovetail on the prior question. Obviously, this year has been impacted by interest FX, some VIL reserves. As we kind of move past that, is high single-digit type AFFO per share growth maybe a more viable aspirational target to consider in 2024 onwards? Or are there other maybe headwinds we should be contemplating as we start to roll the calendar?",
			"<strong>Rodney M. Smith</strong>",
			"Nick. Let me hit the India process first, and then I'll jump into the next question. So we are running a process, as Tom and I have talked about here on this call and in the prior call. It's very similar to the process we walked through when we sold an equity stake in our data center business in the U.S. as well as the European joint venture that we did.<br/>So we've gone out to the top couple dozen highly professional, large investors that are in the infrastructural space. Our goals remain the same that in the other transactions we did, really, which is to partner to or sell the equity to a very strong investor that understands the space, that can help run the business, has government connections, has carrier connections, all those sorts of things. So bringing more than just capital, but also a willingness and some experience to be a strategic partner in the business.<br/>So that process continues. I would say at this point, it's progressing. And we've got the list worked down from the full couple of dozen to a smaller list here, still very active. And I think we'll figure out where we head and what that transaction might look like in the coming quarter. So there'll be more to update you on probably in the next call. But we'll be patient.<br/>We'll be opportunistic as we kind of work through it, and we'll see what the opportunities there look like. And when we decide what we're going to do, we'll have the best interest of the shareholders in mind, of course, and as well as the employees and the customers there in India.<br/>But it's a very similar process that we've kind of gone through before. I guess when you think about the -- jumping into the next question here in terms of AFFO. You know we have AFFO per share growth in our guide here that's a little less than 0, so a negative growth rate.<br/>And I'll just remind you that the headwinds there, as you highlighted, is really the financing interest cost, but also the issuance of the shares that we did middle of last year to help finance the CoreSite business as well as FX. So we are seeing roughly an 8% headwind for the year around the financing pieces, including the spike in interest rates. We're seeing about a 1% headwind roughly on FX. And the VIL reserve that we're taking, that $75 million that we talked about, that represents about a 2% headwind as well.<br/>So when you put all that together, the core underlying business is in fact growing in that 8% to 9% range this year. So -- and we think that feels like a pretty good place for us. So to the extent that we drive 5% organic tenant billings growth in the U.S., we drive a little bit higher organic tenant billings growth in our international markets, we complement that with another 100 basis points or so with new builds. We expand margins as we drop down through the P&amp;L. And then we deployed capital in a prudent way. We certainly think that upper single-digit growth rate is achievable.<br/>Now with that said, there are a few things that could still be items that we need to watch. The VIL situation is a situation that's ongoing that we continue to need to watch. We don't know exactly where interest rates will go. So we're certainly being prudent in trying to reduce our exposure to floating rate debt, get ahead of refinancings and reduce refinancing risk.<br/>And this year, we've already issued just under $3 billion of new bonds, new notes. And that removes the refinancing risk from '23 entirely. Now we're beginning to look at '24 to remove that.<br/>But you put all that together, as long as interest rates cooperate, if that's kind of hangs in there, which we're seeing favorability in the spot rates. So that's kind of trending in a good direction. If we sort out the VIL kind of India volatility, then upper single digits certainly is achievable in this business. We've got a great portfolio of assets in a lot of really good places, and we've got customers that are actively leasing the site. So we feel really good about the (inaudible) core performance of this portfolio.",

			"We'll go next to the line of David Barden with Bank of America.",
			"<strong>David William Barden</strong>",
			"So 2, if I could. So first one for Rod. I just want to make sure I understand this Vodafone Idea situation. So when we came out of the second half and you gave guidance for 2023, you said that you assumed that the collections rate would be roughly equivalent to the second half run rate for 2023. And that number was -- and then you changed to a cash accounting method maybe 70% to 80% of what you expected would be realized.<br/>And yet then you said today that you're actually in the first quarter, had better-than-expected collections. But then you also made a provision, which was almost half the reserves that you expected for the whole year. So I don't know if I understand how all that's working. So if you can kind of help us through that and how it will work, that would be super helpful.<br/>And then the second piece would be, Tom, DISH, stock is hitting a 24-year low. The bonds are yielding 20% to 30% for the next 3 years. It's in a distressed position, and there's a lot of questions I field from people about kind of how comfortable you feel with your contractual relationship? How does that contribute to growth? And then for those of us who maybe aren't as grizzled as some of us veterans, how do you think if a bankruptcy emerged in the wireless space, how would that work in this day and age?",
			"<strong>Rodney M. Smith</strong>",
			"David, I'll take the first one on Voda. So the collections rate that we're seeing in Q1, it's not better than our expectation. It's right in line with our expectation. We expect the level of collections that we had in Q1 to continue into Q2 as kind of the way we're thinking about it.<br/>I'm not sure if I heard all the detail in your question, but I'll try to clarify for you. That collections rate that we experienced in Q1 is slightly better than what we experienced in Q4 of last year and what we experienced in Q3 of last year. So that's where we talk about the improvement in terms of the collections from Vodafone. It's really the first half of this year, let's say, compared to the last half of last year.<br/>The other part of your question, I think it kind of leads into what's happening later in the year. And we do expect an improvement in collections from Vodafone as we enter into the second half of this year. And so that's kind of where we're looking. And we talked to Voda quite frequently. We have -- you have seen -- we've seen that the government converted their equity. That does kind of clear the way a little bit for Voda to work on their balance sheet and to potentially raise equity and debt, and we gather that they're working aggressively on that.<br/>You may have seen a new Board appointment over in India. We think that's a really good fact as well. And we do believe that Voda management is committed to and capable of increasing their payments to us in the second half of the year, and that's reflected in our outlook. So that's kind of how those bits and pieces work. Most of the $75 million reserve that we have in there will be booked and realized in the first half of this year.",
			"<strong>Thomas A. Bartlett</strong>",
			"Dave, with regards to DISH. They remain very active in the market. They are investing throughout the country to meet all of their FCC requirements. They have always been a good partner. I have a lot of faith in their leadership team there in terms of being able to develop the network and drive strategies that make sense for them.<br/>So from our perspective, there has been a very strong player and a very strong partner. I'm not going to speculate on bankruptcies and all the other types of things candidly. But just to let you know that I believe that they're are a really strong leadership team, really smart and being, I think, very intelligent in terms of how they're building out their network.",
			"<strong>David William Barden</strong>",
			"Tom, if I could just follow up. I think that there is a spectrum of relationships that tower companies have with DISH. Some are activity-related, some are kind of minimum take rates with contractual escalators and such. And I think that you're in the latter camp. Is that fair to say?",
			"<strong>Thomas A. Bartlett</strong>",
			"I mean we've been working with DISH for a number of years in terms of helping them look at the engineering of their other network and building out their network. And I would say that our U.S. leadership team has had, I think, a really strong relationship with them right out of the gate.<br/>I can't speculate on other types of relationships with some of the other towercos. But we've been really comfortable with the relationship and how it's been built over the years. And I think that there's a mutual respect for -- between both entities.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"We'll go next to the line of Batya Levi with UBS.",
			"<strong>Batya Levi</strong>",
			"Can you talk a little bit about how you will approach M&amp;A? There seems to be a number of portfolios available in some of the Asian markets that you don't currently have a presence in and maybe some in Europe. If you could just talk about your interest and how you would prioritize portfolio growth in the next couple of years, that would be great.<br/>And a second question maybe just specifically in Europe. What do you see in terms of the carrier activity? And if there's any update on how one-on-one is contributing to your growth? And if they decide to grow the MVNO route, should we expect any impacts on your growth outlook?",
			"<strong>Rodney M. Smith</strong>",
			"Batya. Thanks for the question. So regarding M&amp;A, our view today is consistent with where it's been in the last couple of -- the last few months, certainly the last couple of quarters, which is in this environment, given what's available and kind of the differences that we see in pricing between private tower sales and, let's say, public tower equities, along with some terms and conditions that, of course, are important, when you look at portfolio by portfolio and region by region. We continue to look at the pipeline. And in our evaluation, there's nothing in there that we see that's compelling at the moment. Nothing in there that we see that would require us or prompt us to make any kind of a move.<br/>So then we settle back in and we're firmly kind of committed to our capital allocation approach here going forward. And one of the things that helps guide us is the uncertainty around rates and ensuring that we're reducing our leverage getting back below our 5x in a prudent amount of time, also reducing that floating rate exposure, making sure we're aggressively managing interest rates along with providing a dividend and a growing dividend to our shareholders.<br/>So when you look at the totality of opportunities available, we're fully committed to the dividend and dividend growth. Next, we allocate capital to our capital programs, our internal programs where we build towers. We'll build over -- around 4,000 this year around the globe. Those come in at very high day 1 NOI yields, roughly mid-teens. 14% is the number for the -- for Q1. So we feel that that's really good.<br/>We're also allocating some capital within our capital number for this year towards CoreSite in the mid-$300 million. So let's call it, $360 million or so. And as we've discussed, that's kind of within their cash flow generation. They produce EBITDA or gross margin, let's say, in the mid-$400 million . So we're comfortably kind of reinvesting their cash flow back into their business to make sure that we have capacity to continue to satisfy the customers and keep up with the record demand that we experienced last year in the first quarter of this year.<br/>And I'll highlight again for the folks on the call here that our capital program this year is slightly below last year, not materially below, but they're slightly below. And that's kind of a function of allocating capital towards balance sheet and reducing leverage and reducing our floating rate exposure.<br/>When you think about Europe and Asia, like we would want to be larger in there. We think that market is very constructive for us. We do think there are some interesting portfolios there, but nothing that we've seen yet in terms of terms and conditions and pricing and all the different pieces lining up where it would need to be. And we don't expect that to happen any time soon.<br/>But over the next several years, let's call it, 2 to 5 years, Europe is a place where we could be active in looking at different portfolios. We think there's really good backdrop in Europe. With that said, if we don't buy anything in Europe, we've got a really good portfolio and feel good about our position day 1.<br/>And when you think of Asia, where we spent a lot of time in the last couple of years looking at different transactions in Asia. And again, nothing kind of lined up and met our criteria. We're very disciplined when it comes to pricing terms and conditions, counterparty and also country evaluations and things like that. We'll continue to be disciplined.<br/>And I do think you'll see us be very committed to balance sheet, reducing leverage, reducing floating rate debt and not active in any major way in M&amp;A in the near term.<br/>And then maybe in Europe, the other thing just to hit your other question. We're seeing good activity across Europe. It's a -- when you think about Germany, kind of the center point that Drillisch 1&amp;1 is just beginning to ramp up their network build in a full greenfield 5G build. So we're seeing a little bit of revenue activity from that. But we're excited to support them in their endeavor to build out a network there. And we do think that we'll see more activity with them in the second half of this year and certainly in years to come.<br/>But then when you think about France and Germany and Spain across the board, we think there's a really good backdrop, a good set of counterparties and carriers there for us to support. And we feel really good about the growth rates and our position within those markets. We guided, when we did the Telxius transaction, that we would be achieving mid-single-digit organic tenant billings growth, we've been above that since we acquired the portfolio. And this year, we're again looking at upper single digits in that 7% to 8% range, which is a really nice place.<br/>We've benefited from the activity that we're seeing from the carriers in terms of the leasing. We're also benefited from the contract terms where we have untapped escalators in Germany and in Spain, which is very helpful. And then we're seeing very low churn rates again, because of the demand that we see from the carriers to build out networks and also the way the contracts work that we've been able to negotiate. So we feel really good about our position in Europe. We feel really good about our ability to support the carriers' endeavors to build out networks in Europe, and we think there are some good things to come in Europe.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"We'll go next to the line of Brandon Nispel with KeyBanc Capital Markets.",
			"<strong>Brandon Lee Nispel</strong>",
			"I guess when we look at the U.S. leasing [colo line], $60 million, I think, was a record for the company ever. Are we at the point where that colo number is peaking. And just because if we look at the midpoint of the guide, $220 million, it would imply some deceleration. And then can you just help us just refresh us in terms of how your master lease agreements work in terms of the use fee provided to your customers? I guess my understanding is in year 1 of those contracts, there's typically the highest use fee contribution and that those generally fall off as the term of the contract extends. But I was hoping you can help explain it for us.",
			"<strong>Rodney M. Smith</strong>",
			"Brand. Thanks for the question. So you are correct in terms of the organic new biz, the incremental new biz we get from colocations and amendments that $60 million number. We do see that as a peak for the year.<br/>But with that said, it will be -- we expect that number on a quarterly basis could be between $50 million and $60 million for the next 3 quarters for the full year. So it's not as though we're going to see a big drop off. It is pretty linear there the way things work. So -- but you will see it drift down a little bit, and that is kind of a function of the timing of the MLAs and the use right fees. I don't want to get into too much detail about the contracts and the way the contracts work.<br/>But you can have timing differences here where you have use rate fees that step up in a certain quarter. They're mostly front-end loaded. And then you also have the ability to get additional revenue over and above that, which can be more variable kind of throughout the quarter.<br/>I would say that, that the $220 million that we're seeing this year, there is kind of a function there with the MLAs and kind of some of the transition period that we had kind of moving in and out of different MLAs, that does help support that number a bit. So I wouldn't be surprised if that number is a little bit lower next year. But with that said, we're still seeing kind of the acceleration of that revenue kind of as we enter the beginning of this year. And again, it will taper off on a quarterly basis.<br/>But we'll hit the $220 million for the full year. That again is up almost 50% from the $150 million that we hit last year. And we continue to feel really good about everything that we see and work on in terms of the U.S. business being in a strong position to achieve 5% organic tenant billings growth on average out over the time period through 2027.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"And we have time for 1 more question. That will come from the line of Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo.",
			"<strong>Eric Thomas Luebchow</strong>",
			"Maybe just quickly touching on the data center business, obviously, continuing to perform well. Maybe you could talk about the accelerated growth you're seeing there and kind of disaggregate it between just new leasing and then also pricing. We've heard that supply is really historically tightened data centers and a lot of operators are continuing to push rents.<br/>And then you made a comment, I think, that you're seeing some pockets of densification in certain markets. Maybe you can talk about how you think the cadence of that evolves over the next few years, especially as some of the mid-band spectrum upgrades, amendment revenues start to taper off in the next couple of years?",
			"<strong>Rodney M. Smith</strong>",
			"Eric. Sure. Thanks for joining the call. So we're very excited about the data center business that we have. I think you've heard us say in the past that it's a differentiated set of assets to the extent that it's a cloud-rich center facilities, multiple cloud on-ramps and lots of the facilities that we have, their network and lots of enterprise customers in there.<br/>And that really means there's a lot of interconnection. People come into these facilities for those multiple cloud on-ramps and to interconnect with everyone else, the cloud, the networking companies and the other enterprise companies. That is helping drive this record growth that we've seen. So as we've talked about, we saw record new biz for CoreSite through the full year 2022. We also saw a continuation of that, where we had a record new biz performance for Q1 kind of quarter-over-quarter from prior year, I should say, from Q1 of last year. So that had strong performance certainly is continuing.<br/>That resulted in a 10% revenue growth year-on-year for that business. That's higher than what we underwrote that business for. We've talked about kind of upper single-digit 6% to 8% economic growth in that set of assets. That's the way we underwrote it. And we outperformed last year. We've got a really good start this year. Maybe that 10% thinks back a little bit. But we should be solidly in the upper single-digit growth rate and within our underwriting targets for that business.<br/>We're also seeing really strong growth in interconnection revenue, up about 9.5%. And that's really key because that really represents what these customers are doing within our facilities and why they're there. And it makes the revenue that we have a lot more durable, dependable and sticky because they've got these relationships with other enterprise customers and into all these networking companies. So that is a really good fact.<br/>We're also increasing prices within that market being sensitive to customers as well, but also trying to drive growth in that business and making sure we're getting the value that these assets are contributing to our customers.<br/>So we continue to see cash mark-to-market increases in the 3% to 5% range, 3% to 4% range, which is going well. We have escalators in lots of our contracts, so we generally see a 3% escalator kind of in our underlying contracts. The churn rate continues to be in the mid-single digits in that business, in the 6.5% range, well within our 6% to 8% target.<br/>And our maintenance CapEx is right within our target range of about 2% of revenue, runs in between $20 million and $30 million a year. So we're really pleased with the way that the team is running that business and the way those assets are performing for us. And quite frankly, what those assets do for our customers, which they're really important assets for the customers, and we're continuing at a gross margin that's almost 60%. So we couldn't be more thrilled with the performance of the data center business and the future outlook, quite frankly, and the optionality that those assets provide us when you think about the edge and potentially connecting those assets into our towers and into edge compute facilities closer to our customers' base radios on the wireless side, but also closer to network companies as well as enterprise customers that are scattered throughout the U.S. So that business and the future outlook there is really strong.",

			"Prologis, Inc. misses on earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.5 EPS, expectations were $0.53.",
			"Operator Greetings and welcome to the Prologis First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder this conference is being recorded.It is now my pleasure to introduce to you Jill Sawyer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Jill. You may begin.Jill Sawyer Thanks, Sean. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations.I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management's beliefs and assumptions.Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors.",
			"For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or other SEC filings.Additionally, our fourth quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures.I'd like to welcome Tim Arndt, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, our CEO and our entire executive team are also with us today.With that I hand the call over to Tim.Tim Arndt Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We began the year with results and conditions that remained strong. Market rents have continued to grow, demand has been consistent and we're seeing sharp declines in new construction limiting future supply.While logistics real estate is very healthy, the macroeconomic picture continues to be a concern and we anticipate it could weigh on customer sentiment over the balance of the year translate into some demand that could be delayed into 2024.",
			"However, this will overlap with a slowdown of new deliveries, creating a sustained dynamic for high occupancy and continued rent growth into next year.Beginning with our results, our core FFO excluding promotes was $1.23 per share and including promotes was $1.22 per share. Our results benefited from higher NOI in the quarter but offset by approximately $0.02 of higher insurance expense from an unusually active storm season experiencing a year's worth of claims activity in just the first quarter.In terms of our operating results, both ending and average occupancy for the quarter were 98%, holding average occupancy flat for the fourth quarter. Rent change was 69% on a net effective basis and 42% on a cash basis each a record. The unusually wide spread between the two is reflective of lower free rent and higher escalations in our new leasing.Despite the step-up of in-place rents, our lease mark-to-market expanded to 68% during the quarter as market rent growth remained strong and slightly ahead of expectations.",
			"With the remaining lease term of roughly four years, this lease mark-to-market represents over $2.85 per share of incremental earnings as our leases roll the market, providing visibility to future income and dividend growth. These results drove record same-store growth 9.9% on a net effective basis and 11.4% on a cash basis.During the quarter, our efforts on the balance sheet were focused on liquidity, raising over $3.6 billion in new financings for Prologis and our ventures at an interest rate of 4.6% and a term of nearly 14 years. This fundraising total does not include $1 billion of additional capacity from a recast of our global line-of-credit, which closed in April, and brings our total borrowing potential under our lines to $6.5 billion.As mentioned, fundamentals in our markets remain strong, but we expect that a more cautious outlook will weigh on the pace of demand.",
			"This is not a new perspective as our forecast 90 days ago prepared for a weakening sentiment and how the top-down view for some occupancy loss over the year. We haven't changed that outlook, but we also haven't upgraded it despite the quarter's outperformance.As an update on proprietary metrics, our proposal activity ticked up in absolute terms and is in line with strong market conditions as a percent of available space. Approximately 99% of the units across our 1.2 billion square feet are either leased or in negotiation. Utilization ticked down to 85%, which is normalizing to a level that our customers view as optimal.E-commerce leasing increased during the quarter to 19% of all new leasing. We avoid drawing conclusions from a single quarter of activity on most metrics, but it's notable here, that e-commerce leasing picked up meaningfully back towards its five-year average.",
			"As we've said before, we ultimately look at retention, pre-leasing and rent achievement as the best real-time metrics of portfolio health, and on that basis, our results are certainly very strong.We expect that the current 3.5% vacancy rate in our US markets will build to the low 4s toward the end of the year, before turning back to the mid-3s by late 2024, due to the lack of incoming supply and accounting for moderating demand. We anticipate a similar path in our European markets, and of course, even a 5% vacancy rate is historically excellent and supportive of strong rental growth.We expect this pattern to play out in our true months of supply metric, which was a very healthy 30 months in the US and should decline into the 20s next year. We are launching markets that have large development pipelines such as a few in the Sunbelt in the US, but so far that supply also seems manageable.In Europe, most of our focus is on the UK, where development starts have continued even as demand has moderated, which will lift market vacancies and may pressure rents.",
			"Gustavo Frazao/Shutterstock.com",
			"And Japan is also a market which is expected to see larger increases in vacancy over the year, but similarly, expects a slowdown in new supply due to surges in land and construction costs. Taking all of these movements into account, we are holding our market rent growth forecast for the year at 10% in the US and 9% globally.In capital markets, transactions continue to be few and far between, but the pickup in activity suggests, we will see a busier second quarter. Appraised values in our funds declined 1% in the US and 2% in Europe during the quarter and 8% and 18% respectively from the peak. It's worth noting that our view of public market prices and NAVs that they have adjusted much more than is warranted for these levels of write-down.Redemption requests and our open-ended funds have slowed significantly with the redemption queue nearly unchanged around 5% of net asset value.",
			"This is reflective of both a slower pace of new redemptions as well as rescissions of prior requests. Combined with over $150 million of new commitments made our net queue is essentially unchanged from last year.Last quarter, we described our approach to fulfilling redemption requests, which is based on an overarching objective to be consistent and fair to all investors, requiring a few quarters for valuers to catch up. In that regard, as appraisal seem to be nearing fair value, we plan to redeem units in this quarter, given the swift response to value changes in Europe and expect to do the same in USLF next quarter. In turn, we view this as an excellent time to invest more of our capital into the vehicles, which we'll be doing over the coming quarters and some meaningful numbers.Turning to guidance.",
			"We are tightening and increasing average occupancy to range between 97.25% and 97.75%, a 25 basis point increase at the midpoint. Our same-store will benefit from this increase driving our net effective guidance to a range of 8.5% to 9.25%, and cash same-store of 9% to 9.75%.We are forecasting our lease mark-to-market to end the year close to 70%. Extracting the 2024 component of this suggests rent change should exceed 85% next year, even without continued market rent growth, which is a clear illustration of how our exceptional rent change will not only endure but continue to grow.We expect G&amp;A to range between $380 million and $390 million and strategic capital revenues excluding promotes to range between $515 million and $530 million. We are maintaining our forecast for net promote income of $380 million, and given the size of USLF and the potential for small changes in value to have a meaningful impact, there is potential for upside here and we believe we have the downside covered.We had few development starts in the quarter, a reflection of our discipline, but our pipeline is deep and we are maintaining our guidance of $2.5 billion to $3 billion for the year.",
			"We expect the pace to remain slow in the second quarter, putting the bulk of the activity into the second half. It's noteworthy that following the belief that construction costs may decline in the coming quarters. We now see them as likely to increase mostly in line with inflation.As new fundraising has become visible, we forecast contributions to be concentrated in the second half totaling $2 billion to $3 billion when combined with forecasted dispositions. So in total, we expect GAAP earnings to range between $3.10 per share and $3.25 per share. We are increasing our core FFO including promotes guidance to a range of $5.42 per share to $5.50 per share, and further, we are guiding core FFO excluding promotes to range between $5.02 per share and $5.10 per share, with the midpoint representing 10% growth over 2022.I'd like to close with a few observations that we've made about our standing in the equity markets, which we found interesting and wanted to share.",
			"Today, we sit as the 68th largest company in the S&amp;P 500 ahead of names like GE, American Express, Cigna, Citigroup, as well as Ford and GM combined.Also of notice that with our planned $3.3 billion of dividends this year, we ranked 42nd in terms of total cash return to investors. Of these top 42 dividend payers, Prologis has outgrown the group by 500 basis points per year over the last three years. And in fact, since our IPO, we have paid over $15 billion in dividends at a 15% CAGR, ranking 13th on growth in the entire S&amp;P 100. While getting bigger has never been our objective, we thought the context would be eye-opening.So in closing, we feel great about the health of our business, even in the face of a slowing economy, most importantly, nothing we have seen alters the path of its underlying secular drivers for the long-term potential of our platform.",
			"In that regard, we're excited to tell you much more about that outlook and our platform later in the year.Last week, we announced our upcoming Investor Day to be held at the New York Stock Exchange this December. We hope to see many of you there in person and tuned into the live webcast, where we will showcase our deep bench of talents and the strong differentiators that define our company. More details on that to come.But with that I'll hand it back to the operator for your questions.",

			"<strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong>",
			"Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Caitlin Burrows Hi. Good morning, everyone.",
			"Maybe on development. Tim, you touched on it briefly, but the earnings release mentions how the build-out of your land bank is a driver of growth, and this quarter, like you mentioned starts for only like $50 million versus recent quarters over a billion. And it sounds like that is expected to ramp up significantly to over a billion again in the second half. So just wondering what metrics or other things that you're looking at to drive the starts activity? And what makes you confident that increasing starts so significantly later this year is kind of possible and the right thing to do?Dan Letter Hi, Caitlin. This is Dan. I'll take a stab at that. Maybe Tim can pile on then. But first of all, let me just say, our teams are very much on the offense out there.",
			"Every day our teams around the globe looking at new opportunities. We have over $38 billion of potential TEI embedded in our land bank, and we could flip the switch tomorrow and start $10 billion if we wanted to. We're going to continue to look at these deals on a case-by-case basis, but when you see the overall volatility in the market, you see the 10-year move 50 basis points, 60 basis points on a weekly basis like we have, we're maintaining the discipline, and we're disciplined because we can be. And we're ramping-up our starts towards the end of the year, while we expect to see the overall marketplace ramp down.Operator And our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Please proceed with your question.Ki Bin Kim Thank you.",
			"Good morning. So net absorption across the US in the first quarter was a little bit lighter than what we've seen in recent memory. So I was just curious what kind of risk do you see to occupancy or rent growth as a sector tries to in the near term absorb the new supply coming through?Hamid Moghadam Hi, Ki Bin. This is Hamid. There's always a risk in this environment. I mean there's so many unknowables, but we've gotten spoiled to 350 million square feet of demand in the last couple of years. Let's just put this in a context. I mean in the past, we would have been very happy with even these lower levels of absorption, particularly when you consider that starts are way down and they're going to -- deliveries are going to really slow down as we go into 2024.So it's normalizing.",
			"That's the best way I can describe, but I wouldn't even be surprised if it falls further given all the stuff that we read in the papers. The CEOs that are making big CapEx decisions, basically push their people to see if they can start the week -- a quarter later or two quarters later. But that's all borrow demand, if you will, that is future demand that is getting deferred. So we're not that excited by one way or another.And just to finish the previous question that Dan started, our view, we don't have a forecast for development starts. We only have one because you guys asked us for one. We don't internally have one. We have a plan. We have entitlements on much of that land, about 80% of that land, we can start at any time.And we don't just look at our data at the end-of-the quarter.",
			"We see it every day as we lease a million square feet a day, so we can meter that development into the marketplace, as we see fit and make those adjustments. We're ready to go if we need to do more or less either way.At the end of the day, our company's story is about organic growth, and that's the high value form of growth and that's the one that we pay the most attention to, and actually, that's easier to figure out in this environment, given the very big mark-to-market which I've never seen in this business before. So in a way, our job is actually easier in terms of predictability of earnings and growth.Operator And our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.Steve Sakwa Yeah. Thanks.",
			"Good morning. I just wanted to focus a little bit on the acquisitions, which is not a very large number in there, Hamid, but I'm just wondering what you're seeing from a distressed opportunity said, and then maybe tie into the comments Tim made about the funds and you know you tend to like you'd be putting more money into the funds as you redeem some of the partners. So just trying to put tie those two I guess capital uses together.Hamid Moghadam Sure. I think there is very little distress in the marketplace. Industrial real estate has done really well. I assume other people have significant mark-to-market, although I doubt if there -- it's quite the same level as ours. But there is protection in terms of that mark-to-market and other portfolios, and there are no fore sellers because leverage in the industry is pretty low.So we're not looking for distressed opportunities, but we are looking for opportunities that reflect the increasing cost of capital compared to call it a year, year and a half ago.",
			"And you should know, we look at every deal that anybody does and reads in the papers. Not hard to figure out that if you want to sell something, you call Prologis.So, you know, our feeling is people are still stuck on the old values, and buyers are expecting a substantial discount for those values. I suspect that most of those numbers will move closer together in the next couple of quarters and the market will start transacting.The funds have always been a place where we either take capital out or put capital in, and depending on the cycle of the marketplace. And back even in the global financial crisis, when AMB was much smaller and the balance sheet was weaker, we stepped in and put a couple hundred million dollars in our funds, when I thought -- when we thought that the time was right.So we continue to do the same thing.",
			"I don't think it's a big deal one way or another, but it's a great place to buy a high quality real estate that we know and we like. So that's the way we think about it.Operator And our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.Blaine Heck Great. Thanks. Good morning out there. Can you talk about demand related to near-shoring or on-shoring? Which markets are seeing an outsized impact related to the trend and maybe how Prologis is positioned to benefit from it?Hamid Moghadam Sure. Let me start and then I'll pitch it over to Chris. The biggest impact is on Northern Mexico. Those markets along the border are literally on fire. There is no vacancy and we're seeing a lot of near shoring happening there as sort of a diversification move.We're also seeing some of the China manufacturing bleed out to the rest of Southeast Asia, but we're not really active in those smaller markets, but we do see that.",
			"And it's moving west in China and it's moving to other areas in Southeast Asia. But Mexico is the big story here.The on-shoring part, I mean, honestly, other than what I read in the papers, and the chip business which is real, the rest of it is wishful thinking mostly. So they're very isolated examples, but you look at the numbers and they are not that significant. Chris, do you want to add to that?Chris Caton Sure. I think that's really well described. Blaine, I'd say there isn't great data on this, but that which we see is that it is a building trend in Northern Mexico. So it takes time for those supply chains to relocate instead of the ecosystems they need to really function properly and resiliently. And that is happening and will continue to happen, so I would expect it to grow in the coming years as well.Operator Thank you.",
			"And the next question is from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed with your question.Craig Mailman Thank you. Maybe just a clarification and a follow-up question. Tim, I think in your prepared remarks, you said that the mark-to-market could end this year by 70% and be 85% by the end of next year in the absence of rent growth. So maybe clarify that if I misheard it. And then second question, just as you guys are seeing conditions on the ground, clearly, we saw some of the numbers you guys discussed it normalize here in the first quarter, but could you just talk about maybe how we should think about the cadence or anything incremental, what tenants are saying so that we don't get surprised the next quarter or two with some of the fundamental numbers here coming through as supply does deliver in some of the markets that have had more in the pipeline, like L.A., Inland Empire, Dallas sort of market.",
			"So then just also, you guys maintained your 10% market rent growth. Has that shifted dramatically within markets where some may have weakened significantly while others have grown? Or is it pretty consistent across the border? I apologize. I know that was a lot at once.Hamid Moghadam Nice try unpacking all that in one question.Tim Arndt I guess I will address all three of those. So I'll start, Craig, and I'm glad you asked if there was confusion on the point. You're right that we said we will -- we believe we will see a 70% lease mark-to-market of the entire portfolio at the end of this year, after we roll leases over the course of the year and we have some continued rent growth build.What I was trying to highlight there was that, if you just take out the component of that, that is rolling in 2024, to see have a sense of how this rent change is going to endure, that slice of the 70% on its own is 85% without any more market rent growth in the next nine months.",
			"So that just gives you very clear visibility on how the rent change is going to stay high, how it's going to translate to the same-store growth. So that was the intention there.Hamid R. Moghadam Yeah. Let me take the second part and I'll pitch it to Chris for the third part of the question. Look, you'll be surprised if we're surprised. So -- and we really worked hard at not being surprised. And the best indicator of what's happening is the ongoing leasing and proposals and all that stuff that we're involved and you guys don't really see directly other than at the end of the quarter.So I would say -- I would describe market conditions as very good to excellent. They are not exceptional like they were a year and a half or two years ago, but they are very good to excellent.",
			"The markets you mentioned LA and Inland Empire, not worried about those at all. I mean, those markets are in the one percentage -- one percentage to two percentage vacancy rate.When you get to Dallas and particularly South Dallas and some other markets like Atlanta, way down the South, et cetera, those markets through all the cycles have been prone to over-development and softening of demand when a business was down. So we're watching those very carefully, but I wouldn't characterize any of them as watchlist markets now, otherwise, we would have classified them as such.The 10% rental growth is an overall number, but there is a very wide dispersion around that 10%. And Chris, do you want to elaborate on that?Chris Caton Yeah, indeed, there is a wide dispersion.",
			"And we've been a customer over the years talking about outperformance on the coast and lower growth and lower barrier markets. Historically, that outperformance has averaged 250 basis points to 500 basis points on -- in any given year. This year, that 10% sees more at the lower end of that range, more like 200 basis point, 250 basis point outperformance on the coast versus the lower barrier markets.And so that is where we saw the resilience, and I would also point to other global markets outside the United States. We talked about Mexico on an earlier call. It's probably one of the hotter parts of the world from a logistics real estate perspective. We're also seeing resiliency in Toronto and Northern Europe, Germany and the Netherlands.Operator And our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank.",
			"Please proceed with your question.Derek Johnston Hi, everybody, and good morning. The dislocation between public and private market logistic asset values obviously is weighing on possible M&amp;A. But as Fed policy nears peak rates and currently projects a pause, do you see valuations converging between public and private assets, and secondly, thus a pickup in capital recycling?Hamid Moghadam Yeah. I definitely do see a convergence over time, and private markets are always slow to adjust on the way up and on the way down because it's all backward looking appraisals and people look for comps. And -- but we don't really view the market that way and we view that disconnect as an opportunity because look, we have a very clear view of what the capital markets tell us in terms of the new cost of capital, and we're interested in deploying capital at above that new higher number.And private values are not yet there that's why we see some continued erosion on private values in the next quarter particularly in the United States.",
			"On the other hand, I think the public values are over-discounted and we see those actually picking up as there is more evidence in the private market that the world is not falling off the cliff. So I think you'll get a conversion from both sides and this is not at all unusual compared to past cycles.I would say every cycle gets a little better, but there is still a pretty significant disconnect. And of course, private values can be, whatever you want them to be if you're trying again to prove a point or trying to make a statement. So we are actually, our moat with appraisals -- appraisers that we work with is to continue to point them to the cost of capital as opposed to comps that don't exist.So we are on the other side of that argument. We're trying to get this market to get unlock and to transact and trying to get these appraisers to be realistic about their valuations.",
			"But I can tell you, based on conversations with them, they're getting a lot of pressure the other way from a lot of other people. So they find it somewhat unusual that we want to see a more aligned set of values that will unlock market and liquidity.Operator And the next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.Vikram Malhotra Thanks for taking the questions. So just maybe going back to your comments about more unevenness or maybe just some upward pressure on vacancy across the US. Can you just sort of give us your latest view on -- you said not worried about SoCal, but how would you rank sort of SoCal across your other coastal markets today? And if there is a sort of additional or some softening that you may see, does the Duke acquisition sort of change the overall prospects for the PLD US portfolio?Hamid Moghadam Well, I don't know for sure how to predict the direction of markets, but I can tell you, I don't lose any sleep over SoCal at all.",
			"I think that market is extremely tight and some of the shift in demand or softening of demand is to adjacent markets because the space just doesn't exist in Southern California. So if we had more space, I think we would have more absorption in Southern California as well.The Duke acquisition, as we've described many times, it's very aligned with our portfolio, so fundamentally doesn't change in any way our view on markets or desired allocation of our capital to those markets. It's very much aligned with the pre-merger Prologis portfolio. So the only thing I would tell you about Duke is that I -- generally speaking, based on the leases that we've done, since we acquired portfolio, we are kind of on the order of 4% to 5% higher than we thought we would be in terms of the performance of that portfolio.Operator And the next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.",
			"Please proceed with your question.John Kim Good morning. Tim, you mentioned the fund redemption requests were unchanged at 5% of NAV. Do you still expect the redemptions to go basically down to zero in the back half of the year in light of I think you mentioned weakening sentiment on tenant demand?Tim Arndt Hey, John, we didn't hear any of that. Are you on a cell phone? And if you are, can you get closer to it or something because you were cutting in there?John Kim Is that better?Tim Arndt It's better. Yeah.John Kim Okay. Sorry about that.Tim Arndt So can you start all over?John Kim Sure. You mentioned the fund redemption requests were unchanged, but I was wondering if you expect those redemptions to go down to zero in the back half of the year as previously stated in light of weakening demand that you're seeing on the tenant side.Tim Arndt I don't know.",
			"I can't really predict the portfolio decisions of well over a couple of hundred different investors making those decisions differently. I would say to the extent that there is -- there are redemptions. They are generally not because of the performance of the real estate assets that are invested with us. They are either have to do with denominator issues on their other asset classes, private equity, stock bonds, et cetera, because everything has gotten hit with increased interest rates.Bonds have not been a safe place to be either. So it's because of them getting over allocated to real estate because of the decline in the value of the other asset classes more than real estate. And among real estate, if you want liquidity, where are you going to go?",
			"You're going to go to industrial. You're going to go to apartments, et cetera, et cetera.You're not going to go to office buildings because you're not going to be able to get any liquidity out of those. So that's what's driving all this. It doesn't -- I wouldn't look there for learning anything about what's going on with the industrial market because that's a reaction to a lot of different things that have nothing to do with industrial demand with supply.Operator And the next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.Vince Tibone Hi. Good morning. Have you seen any material changes in tenant demand or industry-wide development starts activity since the banking crisis? And then on the latter point, has the availability of construction loans changed significantly in the last few months?Hamid Moghadam I'm sorry the last part was the availability of loan.Tim Arndt Constructions loan.Hamid Moghadam Construction loan.",
			"The answer to that one is --Vince Tibone Construction loan.Hamid Moghadam Yes, the answer to that one is absolutely, yes. I think there's been a significant pullback in the availability of construction loans. On the rest, I mean, what do you think?Tim Arndt Yes, you were talking about customer demand. We're seeing broad-based customer demand really even looking at our e-commerce, we had 40 unique e-commerce users last quarter alone with Amazon actually being a small size of that very, very small. So overall, broad-based demand, no particular pockets of softness.Hamid Moghadam I would say housing is probably the only, the only aspect that's a little below normal. But again, if you look at the overall numbers, these -- if you sort of forget about 2021 and early '22, and you saw these numbers that we're seeing now, you would feel really good about them.",
			"It's just that in the context of those exceptional years are a little bit softer, but they're still considered to be really good markets, Chris.Chris Caton Hey, Vince, I think I heard in the middle of your question, what is the trend in development starts in the wake of SVB. So it's worth knowing the numbers, which is in the first quarter in the United States development starts were off 40% from their peak across our markets and 45% in Europe. And based on the comment I made earlier around construction debt availability, these numbers are going to -- you're going to continue to see starts to curtail in the marketplace.Hamid Moghadam I mean, I've never seen such a fast slowdown such a sudden slowdown in construction volume in our business. It's just been -- and I'm not sure it's only -- it was related to Silicon Valley Bank.",
			"It was already happening before that, and SVB just made it worse.Operator And our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Yulico in Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.Nicholas Yulico Thanks. I just want to go back to some of the commentary about demand may be spilling into 2024 as companies take a longer time and make financial decisions. I guess what I'm wondering is, how much is that an outlook or just broader corporations taking longer times to make financial decisions versus some of the larger categories of leasing like 3PL, general retail, but it may be expecting consumer slowdown and perhaps not fully utilizing their space. And so that's creating some delay in taking space this year.Hamid Moghadam The utilization rate peaked all time at 87%.",
			"And today, it's at 85%. And there is a couple of points of margin error on those numbers anyway. But -- so I would say utilization is really high. If it were -- if utilization were in the high 70s, I would tell you there's a lot of shadow space and people are going to wait to grow into that space or put it on the market for sub leasing, but we're not seeing that.So I don't think there's a lot of excess slack in the system. And even if you look at the well over publicized Amazon stories that a lot of people waste a lot of time on. I mean, they basically haven't given anything space back, maybe 7 million or 8 million square feet. Yet it's taken half the airtime on all these costs for the last year.It just has not been material. I mean, we're looking for something that just doesn't exist.",
			"Will it exist? I don't know. I'm not clairvoyant. But so far, it doesn't appear that customers are giving back material amounts of space or anything like that. It's totally within the normal band of how our business works across the cycle.Operator And the next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.Michael Goldsmith Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My question is on your view for the balance of the year and what has changed, if anything, on a qualitative and quantitative basis? So you provided some commentary on your cautious outlook on demand and that wasn't new, but at the same time, you took up the same-store NOI guidance, maintained your rent forecasts. Just trying to understand if there's been an evolution in your thinking on how the rest of the year plays out?",
			"Thanks.Tim Arndt Hey, Michael, it's Tim. Now, look, I think you heard our comments correctly and I like that you pointed out, they're relatively unchanged. The same-store move is largely a function of an occupancy move. We just retained a decent amount of occupancy in the first quarter. We think that's going to extend throughout the year, so that's two-thirds of our increase in our same-store guide. The remainder of it is frankly some outperformance in the first quarter, that's more one time in nature, deals with seasonal expenses. We had very little bad debt in the quarter, out of interest, but we don't forecast that to continue. So that's some of the one-time items, but that combination is what is impacting same-store from here.Operator And the next question comes from the line of Nick Thillman with Robert W.",
			"Baird. Please proceed with your question.Nick Thillman Hey, good morning. Retention remains pretty elevated here, but at 80%. But maybe on the tenants that don't resign, what's like their primary reason for not resigning? Is it them outgrowing their current footprint or a case of them just getting priced out of the market? Trying to tie that really to your occupancy in the sub 100,000 square foot area, it's been a little bit lighter than the rest of the leasing categories.Hamid Moghadam So the reason for non-renewal are either good reasons or bad reasons. The bad reason is that the company goes broke or the company -- so the neutral reasons are the company decides to go somewhere else out of one market into another market. The bad reasons are, sorry, the good reasons are that we just don't have a space that fits the growing need of that customer to be accommodated or the shrinking need of that customer to be accommodated.So they have to go somewhere else.",
			"We do track the reason for non-renewal of every single lease that doesn't renew. And one of the things that we track very closely is that we lose the space to a competitor because of pricing. And that statistic is like in the 2%, 3%, 4% range, and I think it's too low because it means that we're not pushing rents hard enough.So it's -- we're not losing tenants because of rent. We're losing tenants because we just can't accommodate them or they go broke or they move somewhere else. And those have been the reasons for the last 40 years I've been doing this.Operator And the next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.Camille Bonnel Hello. Following up on an earlier comment about the vacancy in Southern California region being below 2%.",
			"I think the growing concern is actually on the availability rate or how much sublease activity has picked up which is something we really haven't seen in the past. So I understand, at least within the Southern California region, the supply seems manageable given how difficult it is to build in this market, but could you share your thoughts on how you think this might evolve in upcoming months? And whether or not this is a potential risk you're tracking closely?Chris Caton So two ways to approach that. First, I'll give you the -- this is Chris, by the way, Camille. First is the sublease data, and the second is our true months of supply data. So sublease nationally in the United States is on an availability rate basis, 60 basis points in the first quarter.",
			"The 10-year average, 60 basis points. The recent low indeed was 40 basis points, so it's moved up 20 basis points.Now the pre-COVID average or the pre-COVID low was 50 basis points and the peak in the global financial crisis was 1.1%. If you just summarize all that, first off, I'd offer that it's not a lot of availability. And the second is we're at the low end or at a normal level in sublease.And then I'd also point you to our views on true months of supply that Tim described in our earnings transcript, which said that at 30 months today, we have a very good market environment, consistent with 10% market rent growth. And as supply decelerates and slows, we think that will go back down into the 20s, improving the market landscape.Operator And the next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.",
			"Please proceed with your question.Ronald Kamdem Hey, great. Just one quick one and so on the expected vacancy rate, you talked about 3.5 currently rising throughout the year and then going back down by the end of '24. I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on the supply and the demand assumptions that are going into that? How much is sort of demand normalizing, how much supply normalizing to get back to that 3.5. And the corollary to that would be, if you're expecting 10% market rent growth this year, historically, if you find yourself at that vacancy level at the end of '24, what sort of the market rent growth experience that we should have? And then the other quick one, sorry, on the 85% mark-to-market GAAP mark-to-market for '24, can you talk about what that number is for '23?",
			"Thanks.Chris Caton Thanks for the question, Ronald. So thank you for the opportunity to clarify our market statistics. I want to be very clear. So let's talk about net absorption in the 30 markets where Prologis operates in the United States. Last year, net absorption was 375 million square feet. We call that at 275 this year, and we expect a similar or perhaps higher numbers of macro environment clarifies and some of the decisions that get delayed this year land into '24.So that will be on the demand side completions. We have a bit of a clearer view as we look out to '24. So but starting with 2022, 375 million square feet of supply as well, that's deliveries. We expect 445 million square feet of deliveries this year as a supply pipeline empties and that will fall sharply, perhaps by half or more into 2024.",
			"And so when you put these numbers together, you'll see the vacancy rising from low 3s last year to 4 or a bit higher later this year and then back into the mid-3s.Hamid Moghadam The way to think about it is that demand is normalized from exceptionally high levels and the supply response has been in excess of that normalization of demand because of banking crisis and sort of macro constraints. So I think the supply response has been much more dramatic than the effects on demand. And that's why the market is going to tighten up again. Of course, absence, a calamity or something like that.Tim Arndt One important point to keep in mind is what is a normal vacancy rate because we have been years away from a normal vacancy rate. The historical range for our business is 5% to 10% with pricing power occurring in the 6% to 7% market vacancy rate.",
			"So we're talking about 3.5% to 4% market vacancies, half of what is typically seen as a way to see pricing power.Chris Caton And I would just pile on your third question there on the '24 component of our lease mark-to-market. This year, the same metric is in the low 80s. I think I intimated that last quarter on the call, just as a measure of what we expected our rent change would be this year. Those are -- I'm really talking about the same thing in that context. So roughly in the low 80s for '23.Operator And our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.Michael Mueller Hi. I dropped for a minute, so I apologize if this was asked. Can you talk about like the full year development start yield expectation is compared to the high 7% plus yield that you had in the first quarter.Dan Letter Yes.",
			"Hi, Mike. This is Dan. The yield that you saw in the first quarter was a couple of build-to-suits, really small volume. And what I would say is I would just look to last year and doing better than last year's yield on our starts this year.Hamid Moghadam I think the vast majority of the starts are in the 6s. And I would say the cap rates are up 75 basis points. So margins have gone from 30%, 40% to 20%, 30% something like that. I mean, those are some rough numbers.Operator And the next question comes from the line of Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.Thomas Catherwood Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I want to touch on tenant health for a bit. Obviously, we talked about higher cost of capital and less availability of debt when it comes to real estate but it's also impacting operating industries across the board.",
			"With your expectation of slower economic activity this year, are there any industries where you would be concerned about increasing your exposure at this point in time.Hamid Moghadam Let's talk about credit loss as a measure of customer stability. Bad debt ratio and all that. It's historically, in our business has been in the tens of basis points. Even when you had the lapse in demand in the immediate aftermath of COVID that number got to 60 basis points. So -- and Chris, what would you guess our number is going to get to in the cycle when it's all over in terms of bad debt.Chris Caton I'd say 20, I'm jumping in here. I think 20 will be on average.Hamid Moghadam Yes. So I mean, we don't see it in the numbers and the number of bankruptcies, et cetera, et cetera, that we're monitoring and working on are really not unusual in fact, I would say, that's somewhat unusual.",
			"I was expecting more of them than we're seeing in this point in the cycle. And honestly, we would like to see more of them because, frankly, there's so much mark-to-market in those leases that those kinds of tenant departures are actually an upside.So if anybody sort of has problems with their business or is looking to downsize. We look at that as an opportunity to do a buyout and actually be able to extract higher rents in the marketplace. So really not a concern. And that number -- those numbers that I talked about are out there. You can go look at them and plot the curve. They've been coming down substantially as opposed to from very low levels, but they're still coming down.Tim Arndt I might add on to that one final thought, which is I think the 20 that I'm throwing out is a reflection of some mix shift on credit, I think, in the last five years with the markets this tight, we've not only been able to push rents, keep the portfolio occupied, but we've been greatly enhancing the credit profile of our rent roll, and we think we've got a really strong customer base.Hamid Moghadam Yes.",
			"One final statistic that you guys don't have visibility to, but I'm reading off my sheet of stats here. Historical average of credit watch tenants for us, long-term historical average has been 4.9%. We just watch them.By the way, the average actual default has been 0.15. So we worry about a lot more things than we should. That credit watch number today is at 3.35. So it's down substantially. And so is the actual bad debt ratio. So we worry about a lot of things, but most of them don't actually happen and the numbers are actually quite healthy, not just -- not even adjusting for the cycle and the fact that it's a softening cycle, but just even in the best of markets, these statistics would show up as very good.Operator And the next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc.",
			"Please proceed.Todd Thomas Hi. Thanks. I wanted to follow up on the demand environment and your comments about a more challenging macro in relation to the development starts. I guess, how much visibility do you actually have on starts in the second half of the year as it pertains to the full year target of $2.5 billion to $3 billion? How quickly can that ramp up? And then development yields for what's under construction, they were higher by 20 basis points versus last quarter on the '23 and '24 under construction pipeline. Is that due to improved economics around rents or moderating construction costs which I think you mentioned or really a combination of the two? And do you expect to see further improvements in development yields as you look out in the future?Hamid Moghadam Yes.",
			"Most of our land is entitled and entitlement is a pretty broad definition. I mean, fully entitled means that you pulled the building permit on this specific building that you can start but you might have entitlements and you haven't pulled the specific building permit because you don't exactly know how big a building you're going to build or in what configuration.But 80% of our land is entitled in terms of discretionary entitlements and about 20% to 30% of our land is really good to go with building permits pulled. So that is not a limiter on our ability to start development. So we can start whatever development we want to as we monitor the marketplace.The reason for development yields going on -- going up is that rent growth has been higher than we forecast.",
			"And the costs are essentially the same because we've locked in some of those construction values on the buildings that are starting today. The comment about construction cost has nothing to do with what you're seeing on the starts today. It will affect yield on starts down the road.Our view has changed. That's one area where our view has changed materially. We thought there would be some softening of construction costs to the tune of 5% to 10% and because of IRA and all this new fiscal stimulus going into the construction industry, I mean, it uses the same labor, same materials and everything.Contractors still have pretty good pricing power. So that -- what we thought was going to be a 5% to 10% decline, it's going to be inflationary increase.",
			"So the swing is actually pretty material. Having said all of that, the rental growth more than makes up for it. So I think our yields are trending up.Operator And the next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed.Anthony Powell Hi. Good morning. Quick one for me, I guess, any change in the tenor of conversations with your lending partners or underwriters after the SIVB collapse? Or are you seeing just increased confidence from your partners that you seek to do financing in the future?Hamid Moghadam They're asking us a lot of money. No, it's not really. I mean where that balance sheet is bulletproof. I mean, frankly, we have better balance sheet than most of our banks. So no and we're not really a bank borrower per se, we tap into the capital markets all the time.Operator And the next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC.",
			"Please proceed.Michael Carroll Yeah, thanks. I just wanted to follow up on your planner potential willingness to invest into the property funds. And can you quantify how much you would like? Or are you willing to invest in those funds? And are there any particular ones that you would want to invest in like USLF or PELF or is that still a TBD right now?Hamid Moghadam Well, we're going to invest in PELF sooner than USLF because we think the value adjustments in Europe have been quicker than they have been in the U.S. But I suspect we're only a quarter or so away from even the U.S. adjusting to a normalized value at least we hope.So look, it's a $140 billion balance sheet. So even if we just wanted to allocate 1% of it, and I'm not saying we're going to allocate 1%.",
			"I'm just kind of size the issue for you, that could be $1.5 billion. We're probably not going to invest $1.5 billion, but it's got to be like a small portion of our overall balance sheet.But we love that stuff because we know it. We like it. It's exactly the kind of property we want to have. And redemptions give us a really good opportunity to do that without affecting the strategy of the fund.Operator And the next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.James Feldman Great. Thank you. I thought your commentary on credit was pretty interesting in terms of how low it is. I guess you have such a wide view of what's going on in the world. Can you just talk through maybe across your regions, some of the data points you're seeing that either give you some confidence in where the economy is heading or give you some concern about where the economy is heading and how that factors into where you want to put capital to work?Hamid Moghadam I'll just take two things.",
			"This is more a global comment than US comment. Japan is having more supply than it normally has, but demand is actually still pretty strong. I'm a little worried about vacancy rates in Japan going up into the mid-teens.So that's one place we're seeing it. The U.K. has actually been pretty surprisingly good on the industrial side. If you look at the headlines for the U.K., you would expect more trouble than what we're seeing in the industrial market. In the U.S., it's -- I can't think of a trend that it's worth talking about that. The markets are generally pretty good. I mean can you guys think of anything?Chris Caton Hey, Jamie, it's Chris Caton. There's been a lot of economic news over the last few weeks, and I think there are probably three takeaways.",
			"The first is consumers are stable, notwithstanding all the noise in that. And it seems to be treading towards perhaps GDP growth of 2%, if not a bit higher. Second, I think quite clearly, e-commerce is reaccelerating with online shopping, now back on trend taking 100 basis points of share from in-store. And the third is, indeed, inventories are rising but they have not yet risen to pre-COVID level, little on a higher level for resilience.Hamid Moghadam With Jamie's question, that's the last one in the queue. I wanted to thank all of you for participating in our call. We're excited over here because it's our 40th anniversary that we'll be celebrating in June. And there are going to be lots of opportunities between the investor meeting later on in the year and also GROUNDBREAKERS where we will be speaking to you.",
			"So I look forward to seeing all of you and take care.Operator And that concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a great day."

Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.",

The Company computes EBITDAre in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or Nareit, which may not be comparable to EBITDAre reported by other REITs that do not compute EBITDAre in accordance with the Nareit definition, or that interpret the Nareit definition differently than the Company does. The White Paper on EBITDAre was approved by the Board of Governors of Nareit in September 2017.",
			"Management considers EBITDAre a useful metric for investors as it provides an additional indicator of the Company’s ability to incur and service debt, and enables investors to assess our performance against that of its peer REITs. EBITDAre should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income and cash flow as a measure of the Company’s activities in accordance with GAAP. EBITDAre does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. A reconciliation between net income/(loss) and EBITDAre is provided on Attachment 4(C) of the Company's quarterly supplemental disclosure.",
			"<b>Effective Blended Lease Rate Growth:</b> The Company defines Effective Blended Lease Rate Growth as the combined proportional growth as a result of Effective New Lease Rate Growth and Effective Renewal Lease Rate Growth.

			"Management believes that FFO as Adjusted is useful supplemental information regarding our operating performance as it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods and allows investors to more easily compare our operating results with other REITs. FFO as Adjusted is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. The Company believes that net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to FFO as Adjusted. However, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating FFO as Adjusted or similar FFO measures and, accordingly, our FFO as Adjusted may not always be comparable to FFO as Adjusted or similar FFO measures calculated by other REITs. FFO as Adjusted should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity. A reconciliation from net income attributable to common stockholders to FFO as Adjusted is provided on Attachment 2.",

This definition conforms with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust's definition issued in April 2002 and restated in November 2018. In the computation of diluted FFO, if OP Units, DownREIT Units, unvested restricted stock, unvested LTIP Units, stock options, and the shares of Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock are dilutive, they are included in the diluted share count.",

Rental income represents gross market rent and other revenues less adjustments for concessions, vacancy loss and bad debt. Rental expenses include real estate taxes, insurance, personnel, utilities, repairs and maintenance, administrative and marketing. Excluded from NOI is property management expense, which is calculated as 3.25% of property revenue, and land rent. Property management expense covers costs directly related to consolidated property operations, inclusive of corporate management, regional supervision, accounting and other costs.",
			"Management considers NOI a useful metric for investors as it is a more meaningful representation of a community’s continuing operating performance than net income as it is prior to corporate-level expense allocations, general and administrative costs, capital structure and depreciation and amortization and is a widely used input, along with capitalization rates, in the determination of real estate valuations.

Based upon the level of material impact the redevelopment has on the community (operations, occupancy levels, and future rental rates), the community may or may not maintain Stabilization. As such, for each redevelopment, the Company assesses whether the community remains in Same-Store.",
			"<b>Same-Store Revenue with Concessions on a Cash Basis:</b> Same-Store Revenue with Concessions on a Cash Basis is considered by the Company to be a supplemental measure to rental income on a straight-line basis which allows investors to evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by its peer REITs. In addition, Same-Store Revenue with Concessions on a Cash Basis allows an investor to understand the historical trends in cash concessions.",

These forward-looking statements, which you can identify by the Company’s use of words such as \"expects,\" \"plans,\" \"estimates,\" \"anticipates,\" \"projects,\" \"intends,\" \"believes,\" \"outlook,\" \"may,\" \"shall,\" \"will,\" \"pursue\" and similar expressions that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters, are based on the Company’s expectations, forecasts and assumptions at the time of this release, which may not be realized and involve risks and uncertainties that cannot be predicted accurately or that might not be anticipated. These could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that might cause such differences include the following: we may abandon development or redevelopment opportunities for which we have already incurred costs; adverse capital and credit market conditions, including rising interest rates, may affect our access to various sources of capital and/or cost of capital, which may affect our business activities, earnings and common stock price, among other things; changes in local employment conditions, demand for apartment homes, supply of competitive housing products, landlord-tenant laws, including the adoption of rent control regulations, and other economic or regulatory conditions may result in lower than expected occupancy and/or rental rates and adversely affect the profitability of our communities; delays in completing development, redevelopment and/or lease-up, and general price inflation, may result in increased financing and construction costs and may delay and/or reduce the profitability of a community; debt and/or equity financing for development, redevelopment or acquisitions of communities may not be available or may not be available on favorable terms; we may be unable to obtain, or experience delays in obtaining, necessary governmental permits and authorizations; expenses may result in communities that we develop or redevelop failing to achieve expected profitability; our assumptions concerning risks relating to joint ventures and our ability to successfully dispose of certain assets may not be realized; investments made under the Structured Investment Program in either mezzanine debt or preferred equity of third-party multifamily development may not be repaid as expected; our assumptions and expectations in our financial outlook may prove to be too optimistic; litigation costs and consequences may exceed our expectations; and risks related to pandemics, including the effect, among other factors, on the multifamily industry and the general economy of measures taken by businesses and the government, such as governmental limitations on the ability of multifamily owners to evict residents who are delinquent in the payment of their rent, the preferences of consumers and businesses for living and working arrangements, and federal efforts at economic stimulus. Additional discussions of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements appear in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 under the heading \"Risk Factors\" and under the heading \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Forward-Looking Statements\" and in subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.",
			"The Company does not undertake a duty to update forward-looking statements, including its expected 2023 operating results and other financial data forecasts contained in this release. The Company may, in its discretion, provide information in future public announcements regarding its outlook that may be of interest to the investment community. The format and extent of future outlooks may be different from the format and extent of the information contained in this release.",
			"<b>Definitions and Reconciliations</b>",
			"Non-GAAP financial measures and other capitalized terms, as used in this earnings release, are defined, reconciled and further explained on Attachment 11, Definitions and Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Terms. Attachment 11 is included in the full earnings release available at the Company’s website at <span><a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:http://investors.avalonbay.com;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestors.avalonbay.com&amp;esheet=53387811&amp;newsitemid=20230425006143&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=http%3A%2F%2Finvestors.avalonbay.com&amp;index=6&amp;md5=0a7d2dc5f12ce52f87b17888698e14db\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">http://investors.avalonbay.com</a></span>. This wire distribution includes only the following definitions and reconciliations.",
			"<span>Average Monthly Rental Revenue per Occupied Home</span> is calculated by the Company as Residential rental revenue in accordance with GAAP, divided by the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes.",
			"<span>Commercial</span> represents results attributable to the non-apartment components of the Company's mixed-use communities and other non-residential operations.",
			"<span>Development</span> is composed of consolidated communities that are either currently under construction, or were under construction and were completed during the current year. These communities may be partially or fully complete and operating.",
			"<span>EBITDA, EBITDAre and Core EBITDAre</span> are considered by management to be supplemental measures of our financial performance. EBITDA is defined by the Company as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDAre is calculated by the Company in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"Nareit\"), as EBITDA plus or minus losses and gains on the disposition of depreciated property, plus impairment write-downs of depreciated property, with adjustments to reflect the Company's share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated entities. Core EBITDAre is the Company’s EBITDAre as adjusted for non-core items outlined in the table below. By further adjusting for items that are not considered part of the Company’s core business operations, Core EBITDAre can help one compare the core operating and financial performance of the Company between periods. A reconciliation of EBITDA, EBITDAre and Core EBITDAre to net income is as follows (dollars in thousands):",
			"<span>Economic Gain</span> is calculated by the Company as the gain on sale in accordance with GAAP, less accumulated depreciation through the date of sale and any other adjustments that may be required under GAAP accounting. Management generally considers Economic Gain to be an appropriate supplemental measure to gain on sale in accordance with GAAP because it helps investors to understand the relationship between the cash proceeds from a sale and the cash invested in the sold community. The Economic Gain for disposed communities is based on their respective final settlement statements.",
			"<span>Economic Occupancy</span> is defined as total possible Residential revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of total possible Residential revenue. Total possible Residential revenue (also known as \"gross potential\") is determined by valuing occupied units at contract rates and vacant units at Market Rents. Vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current Market Rents. By measuring vacant apartments at their Market Rents, Economic Occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community’s gross revenue.",
			"<span>FFO and Core FFO</span> are generally considered by management to be appropriate supplemental measures of our operating and financial performance. FFO is calculated by the Company in accordance with the definition adopted by Nareit. FFO is calculated by the Company as Net income or loss attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for gains or losses on sales of previously depreciated operating communities, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate assets, write-downs of investments in affiliates which are driven by a decrease in the value of depreciable real estate assets held by the affiliate and depreciation of real estate assets, including adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO can help one compare the operating and financial performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies because the adjustments such as (i) excluding gains or losses on sales of previously depreciated property or (ii) real estate depreciation may impact comparability between companies as the amount and timing of these or similar items can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful like estimates. Core FFO is the Company's FFO as adjusted for non-core items outlined in the table below. By further adjusting for items that are not considered by us to be part of our core business operations, Core FFO can help with the comparison of core operating performance of the Company between periods. A reconciliation of Net income attributable to common stockholders to FFO and to Core FFO is as follows (dollars in thousands):",
			"<span>Interest Coverage</span> is calculated by the Company as Core EBITDAre divided by interest expense. Interest Coverage is presented by the Company because it provides rating agencies and investors an additional means of comparing our ability to service debt obligations to that of other companies. A calculation of Interest Coverage for the three months ended March 31, 2023 is as follows (dollars in thousands):",
			"<span>Market Cap Rate</span> is defined by the Company as Projected NOI of a single community for the first 12 months of operations (assuming no repositioning), less estimates for non-routine allowance of approximately $300 - $500 per apartment home, divided by the gross sales price for the community. Projected NOI, as referred to above, represents management’s estimate of projected rental revenue minus projected operating expenses before interest, income taxes (if any), depreciation and amortization. For this purpose, management’s projection of operating expenses for the community includes a management fee of 2.25%. The Market Cap Rate, which may be determined in a different manner by others, is a measure frequently used in the real estate industry when determining the appropriate purchase price for a property or estimating the value for a property. Buyers may assign different Market Cap Rates to different communities when determining the appropriate value because they (i) may project different rates of change in operating expenses and capital expenditure estimates and (ii) may project different rates of change in future rental revenue due to different estimates for changes in rent and occupancy levels. The weighted average Market Cap Rate is weighted based on the gross sales price of each community.",
			"<span>Market Rents</span> as reported by the Company are based on the current market rates set by the Company based on its experience in renting apartments and publicly available market data. Market Rents for a period are based on the average Market Rents during that period and do not reflect any impact for cash concessions.",
			"<span>Net Debt-to-Core EBITDAre</span> is calculated by the Company as total debt (secured and unsecured notes, and the Company's Credit Facility and commercial paper program) that is consolidated for financial reporting purposes, less consolidated cash and cash in escrow, divided by annualized first quarter 2023 Core EBITDAre. A calculation of Net Debt-to-Core EBITDAre is as follows (dollars in thousands):",
			"<span>NOI</span> is defined by the Company as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses (including property taxes), and excluding corporate-level income (including management, development and other fees), corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses, expensed transaction, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries, interest expense, net, loss on extinguishment of debt, net, general and administrative expense, income from investments in unconsolidated entities, depreciation expense, income tax expense (benefit), casualty loss, gain on sale of communities, other real estate activity and net operating income from real estate assets sold or held for sale. The Company considers NOI to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to Net Income of operating performance of a community or communities because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level property management overhead or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community, and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead as a result of acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or groups of assets.",
			"Residential NOI represents results attributable to the Company's apartment rental operations, including parking and other ancillary Residential revenue. A reconciliation of Residential NOI to Net Income, as well as a breakdown of Residential NOI by operating segment, is as follows (dollars in thousands):",
			"NOI as reported by the Company does not include the operating results from assets sold or classified as held for sale. A reconciliation of NOI from communities sold or classified as held for sale is as follows (dollars in thousands):",
			"Commercial NOI is composed of the following components (in thousands):",
			"<span>Other Stabilized</span> is composed of completed consolidated communities that the Company owns, which have Stabilized Operations as of January 1, 2023, or which were acquired subsequent to January 1, 2022. Other Stabilized excludes communities that are conducting or are probable to conduct substantial redevelopment activities.",
			"<span>Projected FFO and Projected Core FFO</span>, as provided within this release in the Company’s outlook, are calculated on a basis consistent with historical FFO and Core FFO, and are therefore considered to be appropriate supplemental measures to projected Net Income from projected operating performance. A reconciliation of the ranges provided for Projected FFO per share (diluted) for the second quarter and full year 2023 to the ranges provided for projected EPS (diluted) and corresponding reconciliation of the ranges for Projected FFO per share to the ranges for Projected Core FFO per share are as follows:",
			"<span>Projected NOI</span>, as used within this release for certain Development communities and in calculating the Market Cap Rate for dispositions, represents management’s estimate, as of the date of this release (or as of the date of the buyer’s valuation in the case of dispositions), of projected stabilized rental revenue minus projected stabilized operating expenses. For Development communities, Projected NOI is calculated based on the first twelve months of Stabilized Operations following the completion of construction. In calculating the Market Cap Rate, Projected NOI for dispositions is calculated for the first twelve months following the date of the buyer’s valuation. Projected stabilized rental revenue represents management’s estimate of projected gross potential minus projected stabilized economic vacancy and adjusted for projected stabilized concessions plus projected stabilized other rental revenue. Projected stabilized operating expenses do not include interest, income taxes (if any), depreciation or amortization, or any allocation of corporate-level property management overhead or general and administrative costs. In addition, projected stabilized operating expenses for Development communities do not include property management fee expense. Projected gross potential for Development communities and dispositions is generally based on leased rents for occupied homes and management’s best estimate of rental levels for homes which are currently unleased, as well as those homes which will become available for lease during the twelve month forward period used to develop Projected NOI. The weighted average Projected NOI as a percentage of Total Capital Cost (\"Weighted Average Initial Projected Stabilized Yield\") is weighted based on the Company’s share of the Total Capital Cost of each community, based on its percentage ownership.",
			"Management believes that Projected NOI of the Development communities, on an aggregated weighted average basis, assists investors in understanding management's estimate of the likely impact on operations of the Development communities when the assets are complete and achieve stabilized occupancy (before allocation of any corporate-level property management overhead, general and administrative costs or interest expense). However, in this release the Company has not given a projection of NOI on a company-wide basis. Given the different dates and fiscal years for which NOI is projected for these communities, the projected allocation of corporate-level property management overhead, general and administrative costs and interest expense to communities under development is complex, impractical to develop, and may not be meaningful. Projected NOI of these communities is not a projection of the Company's overall financial performance or cash flow. There can be no assurance that the communities under development will achieve the Projected NOI as described in this release.",
			"<span>Redevelopment</span> is composed of consolidated communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is probable to begin during the current year. Redevelopment is considered substantial when (i) capital invested during the reconstruction effort is expected to exceed the lesser of $5,000,000 or 10% of the community’s pre-redevelopment basis and (ii) physical occupancy is below or is expected to be below 90% during or as a result of the redevelopment activity. Redevelopment includes one community containing 714 apartment homes that is currently under active redevelopment as of March 31, 2023.",
			"<span>Residential</span> represents results attributable to the Company's apartment rental operations, including parking and other ancillary Residential revenue.",
			"<span>Residential Rental Revenue with Concessions on a Cash Basis</span> is considered by the Company to be a supplemental measure to Residential rental revenue in conformity with GAAP to help investors evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on GAAP-based Residential rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies. In addition, Residential Rental Revenue with Concessions on a Cash Basis allows an investor to understand the historical trend in cash concessions.",
			"A reconciliation of Same Store Residential rental revenue in conformity with GAAP to Residential Rental Revenue with Concessions on a Cash Basis is as follows (dollars in thousands):",
			"<span>Same Store</span> is composed of consolidated communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful as these communities were owned and had Stabilized Operations, as defined below, as of the beginning of the respective prior year period. Therefore, for 2023 operating results, Same Store is composed of consolidated communities that have Stabilized Operations as of January 1, 2022, are not conducting or are not probable to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and are not held for sale or probable for disposition within the current year.",
			"<span>Stabilized Operations/Restabilized Operations</span> is defined as the earlier of (i) attainment of 90% physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment.",
			"<span>Total Capital Cost</span> includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to develop the respective Development or Redevelopment community, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees and a contingency estimate, offset by proceeds from the sale of any associated land or improvements, all as determined in accordance with GAAP. Total Capital Cost also includes costs incurred related to first generation commercial tenants, such as tenant improvements and leasing commissions. For Redevelopment communities, Total Capital Cost excludes costs incurred prior to the start of redevelopment when indicated. With respect to communities where development or redevelopment was completed in a prior or the current period, Total Capital Cost reflects the actual cost incurred, plus any contingency estimate made by management. Total Capital Cost for communities identified as having joint venture ownership, either during construction or upon construction completion, represents the total projected joint venture contribution amount. For joint ventures not in construction, Total Capital Cost is equal to gross real estate cost.",
			"<span>Uncollectible lease revenue and government rent relief</span>",
			"The following table provides uncollectible Residential lease revenue as a percentage of total Residential rental revenue in the aggregate and excluding amounts recognized from government rent relief programs in each respective period. Government rent relief reduces the amount of uncollectible Residential lease revenue. The Company expects the amount of rent relief recognized to continue to decline in 2023 absent additional funding from the Federal government.",
			"<span>Unconsolidated Development</span> is composed of communities that are either currently under construction, or were under construction and were completed during the current year, in which we have an indirect ownership interest through our investment interest in an unconsolidated joint venture. These communities may be partially or fully complete and operating.",
			"<span>Unencumbered NOI</span> as calculated by the Company represents NOI generated by real estate assets unencumbered by outstanding secured notes payable as of March 31, 2023 as a percentage of total NOI generated by real estate assets. The Company believes that current and prospective unsecured creditors of the Company view Unencumbered NOI as one indication of the borrowing capacity of the Company. Therefore, when reviewed together with the Company’s Interest Coverage, EBITDA and cash flow from operations, the Company believes that investors and creditors view Unencumbered NOI as a useful supplemental measure for determining the financial flexibility of an entity. A calculation of Unencumbered NOI for the three months ended March 31, 2023 is as follows (dollars in thousands):",

			"With out of control inflation, falling banks, uncertain geopolitical situation and layoffs all around you, it’s hard to stay focused on your long-term investing goals. But if we look at the history, there’s almost always a crisis looming large in financial markets. Investing in quality stocks and staying invested for the long term differentiates successful investors from average investors.",
			"Stocks outperform government bonds, but only when held for the long term. Several studies show that if you invest in stocks and cash out during volatility or downturns, you miss out on the potential gains that come during bull runs. According to an excellent paper titled “<a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:How Long is a Long-Term Investment;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=0a99a1171ef76cac2be20c0f004b4145b1df1f31\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">How Long is a Long-Term Investment</a>” authored by Pu Shen of Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City - Economic Research Department, from 1926 to 2002, the total compound annual rate of return of an index of all U.S. stocks, including dividends, was about 9.7%. On the other hand, long-term government bonds average only about 5.5%.",
			"The paper says that the average business cycle in the US is 8 years. If you stay invested in stocks for say one or two decades, the short-term risks become irrelevant since short-term price movements of stocks offset each other over long business cycles. That’s why the risks associated with stocks decline faster when the average holding period increases. This is the power of long-term investing and that’s what makes people like Warren Buffett successful in a highly-volatile stock market.",

			"<strong>W. P. Carey Inc.</strong> WPC, a leading real estate investment trust (REIT), is set to announce its first-quarter 2023 earnings on Apr 28 before the bell.<br/><br/>The company has been on a growth trajectory in recent years due to its diversified portfolio and focus on long-term triple net leases. In this article, we will provide an overview of WPC and discuss the key factors that are likely to impact its first-quarter 2023 results.<br/><br/>In the last reported quarter, this New York-based net lease REIT came up with an in-line performance in terms of adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share. Over the trailing four quarters, W. P. Carey’s adjusted FFO per share surpassed estimates on three occasions and met on the other, the average surprise being 3.11%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:",
			"W.P. Carey Inc. price-eps-surprise | W.P. Carey Inc. Quote",
			"One of the key factors that sets W. P. Carey apart from other REITs is its diversified portfolio. The company invests in a wide range of property types and industries, which helps reduce risks and ensures consistent cash flows.<br/><br/>Additionally, WPC has a focus on triple net leases, which shift most operating expenses, taxes and insurance costs to the tenant. This structure provides a stable income stream for the company and reduces its exposure to inflation and other economic factors.",
			"W. P. Carey focuses on investing in high-quality, single-tenant, industrial, warehouse and retail properties. These are located mainly in the United States and Northern and Western Europe.<br/><br/>This diversified net lease REIT specializes in sale-leasebacks, build-to-suits and the acquisition of single-tenant net lease properties. WPC is poised to benefit from its portfolio of operationally-critical commercial real estate, which it leases back to creditworthy tenants on a long-term basis, with built-in rent escalators.<br/><br/>W. P. Carey is also focused on capitalizing on accretive investment opportunities. These investments come as part of the company’s external growth strategy and diversified approach. Since the beginning of 2023 through Apr 4, the company has completed $650 million in investments, with the majority of these related to industrial properties.<br/><br/>However, several key factors are likely to impact WPC's first-quarter 2023 earnings. While the company's portfolio has remained relatively stable, there could be some short-term impacts on occupancy rates and rent collections in certain sectors.<br/><br/>Particularly, choppiness in the economy and its impact on economic activity might affect the demand for several real estate, and W. P. Carey’s portfolio is not immune to such impacts. Hence, while WPC’s first-quarter results are likely to reflect gains from its high-quality diversified portfolio and strategic investments, choppiness in certain real estate categories is likely to have been a concern.<br/><br/>Another factor to watch is interest rates. W. P. Carey has a significant amount of debt, and rising interest rates could increase its borrowing costs and impact its profitability.",
			"Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter revenues is pegged at $419.82 million, indicating a 20.5% increase from the prior-year quarter. The consensus estimate for lease revenues for the first quarter is currently pegged at $356.39 million, ahead of the prior-year quarter’s figure of $307.73 million.<br/><br/>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from real estate ownership is presently pegged at $419.82 million, up from the $344.09 reported in the year-ago quarter.<br/><br/>W. P. Carey’s activities during the quarter under review were adequate to secure analysts’ confidence. The consensus estimate for the quarterly adjusted FFO per share has moved north by two cents in a month to $1.32. However, it suggests a decline of 2.22% year over year.",
			"Our proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for W. P. Carey this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an FFO beat. However, that’s not the case here.<br/><br/>W. P. Carey currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of +1.14%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br/><br/>However, our model shows that <strong>VICI Properties Inc.</strong> VICI and <strong>Americold Realty Trust, Inc.</strong> COLD have the right combination of elements to report a surprise this quarter.<br/><br/>VICI Properties is slated to report quarterly numbers on May 1. VICI has an Earnings ESP of +10.38% and carries a Zacks Rank of 1 presently.<br/><br/>Americold Realty Trust, scheduled to report quarterly numbers on May 4, has an Earnings ESP of +17.72% and carries a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see <strong>the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br/><br/>Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.",
			"W. P. Carey has been a strong performer in the REIT sector in recent years due to its diversified portfolio and focus on long-term triple net leases. While there are some short-term risks related to choppiness in the economy and rising interest rates, WPC's strong fundamentals and proactive debt management offer investors reasons to be optimistic about its future growth prospects. Investors should pay close attention to the company's first-quarter 2023 earnings report, which could provide valuable insight into W. P. Carey’s trajectory in the coming quarters.<br/><br/>Note: <em>Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.</em>",

The figure, however, compared favorably with the year-ago period’s $1.87. Our estimate for the same was pegged at $1.98.<br/><br/>Higher operating expenses in the quarter were a deterrent.

			"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Revenue for the first quarter of 2023 was $584 million or 13% growth year-over-year, coming in at the high end of our guidance range and above consensus estimates. I'm very pleased with the growth of our commercial information and nonresidential marketplace businesses, which delivered 15% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter. I'm also very pleased with the progress we're making in building the new Homes.com, which I believe will become the best online residential marketplace in the world, bar none. <br/>We started the year strong with net new sales of $80 million, our second highest sales quarter ever, and a 17% increase over the first quarter of the prior year. Apartments.com achieved the highest net new sales quarter for the second quarter in a row. LoopNet achieved outstanding results in the quarter with a 100% increase in net new sales over the first quarter of last year. We hit a new high watermark in traffic to our marketplaces in March. Monthly unique visitors totaled $94 million for the month with Apartments.com, Homes.com, LoopNet, Lands, BizBuySell, Belbex, BureauxLocaux, Business Immo and all of our marketplaces, contributing up to tens of millions of unique visitors. <br/>Apartments.com continued its impressive run with another outstanding quarter. Apartments.com revenue was $211 million in the first quarter, climbing to 20% year-over-year for the first time since the first quarter of '21. Net new sales bookings were at an all-time high, breaking the record set just last quarter with an increase of 110% over the first quarter of '22. Apartments.com, while very successful, has millions of apartments that do not yet advertise on the site. <br/>We are focused on continuing to grow our sales force to reach this huge potential untapped audience. Our attention to attracting the best talent and excellent onboarding and training of new hires is paying good dividends. Our sales team productivity is up over 40% compared to last year for hires who have been with us less than a year. We are committed to excellent customer service, and that's a big contributor to our success. The apartment sales team conducted close to 140,000 quality meetings this quarter, which is 24% higher than the same quarter last year. Of those 140,000 quality meetings, over 50,000 were in person, a 45% increase over the first quarter of '22. This attention to servicing continues to be well received by our clients as evidenced by our industry-leading Net Promoter Score of 94. <br/>The number of properties advertising on our platform continues to expand and is now at a record 64,000 properties. Our customers are selecting higher ad package levels to obtain more leads as evidenced by our average revenue per property increase of 14% over the prior year. The economic fundamentals of the apartment industry continue to move in our favor. The vacancy rate for 3-, 4- and 5-star properties rose another 30 basis points to 7.7% in the first quarter, and net deliveries continue to outpace net absorption in the quarter with twice the units delivered as absorbed. <br/>Deliveries in '23 are expected to be the highest in over 40 years, and vacancy rates are forecast to increase for the remainder of the year. There are currently over 1 million units under construction, with approximately 750,000 of them being at the top end of the market. Pressure on these assets will be intense throughout 2023 as rent levels moderate. We expect vacancy rates to remain elevated by historical standards. All this could create a jet stream-like tailwind for advertising demand. <br/>March marked the official role to the new 2023 Apartments.com marketing campaign with new TV commercials, streaming videos and streaming audio commercials. Jeff Goldblum as Brad Bellflower was featured during March Madness and all month across top networks like CBS, Bravo, TBS, TNT and more. We launched a new social media campaign, our streaming audio and podcast campaigns have hit the airwaves and engagements are at an all-time high. <br/>We anticipate that our 2023 campaign will yield 12 billion media impressions. The early results of this campaign are strong with our first quarter unaided brand awareness for Apartments.com jumping to our highest score ever. Apartments.com continues to attract qualified renters to our platform with an average of over 43 million monthly unique visitors in the quarter, according to Google Analytics. Apartments.com is also benefiting from the addition of Homes.com rental area to its network and the tremendous growth in traffic to Homes.com. Visitors to the homes rental area up 83% since the fourth quarter of 2022, and those visitors delivered approximately 200,000 leads to our paying Apartments.com customers, that's up 124% from just last quarter. <br/>With more content than ever before on our network, including unit level details and touring capabilities, our lead quality continues to outperform our competitors. Our mobile sessions were an all-time high in the first quarter with 75% of Apartments.com user sessions conducted on a mobile device. Just 5 keywords now account for 33% of unbranded search activity on these devices. When the top 376 cities in the United States are examined, Apartments.com ranks #1 for all 5 of these terms 99% of the time. <br/>The combination of the kickoff of our 2023 marketing campaign, market conditions and our larger and more seasoned sales teams helped continue to drive strong results. In sum, I am very pleased to report that we expect Apartments.com to deliver 22% to 23% revenue growth in 2023. <br/>I'm very excited about the progress we've made on many Homes.com initiatives in the short period of time. Last year, we laid out the key milestones for Homes.com: grow, monetize and scale. The grow phase focused on increasing traffic, engaging buyers and sellers on our platform. Our initial goal in the grow phase was to achieve 25 million unique visitors, while our goal in the scale phase was to reach 50 million unique visitors. Traffic to our Homes.com network grew dramatically. We reached 27 million unique visitors in March according to Google Analytics. <br/>Month-to-date in April, traffic to Homes.com grew 53% over the same period March to date. As of this morning, for the partial month to date, we have already seen 28 million unique visitors to Homes.com network. Unique visitors for our Homes.com network is 88% above March of last year, and traffic to our Homes.com site is up 183% compared to last year. <br/>We are now 4x the traffic levels from when we purchased Homes.com almost 2 years ago. By comparison, 2 years after we purchased Apartments.com, we'd only doubled the traffic. As we continue to build Homes.com and combine single-family residential with rental content from Apartments.com, we can now aggregate our traffic across both property marketplaces. <br/>In total, monthly unique visitors in March for our Apartments.com and Homes.com network was 72 million according to Google Analytics. For the fourth quarter of 2022, Realtor.com reported 66 million monthly unique visitors, while Redfin reported 44 million average monthly unique visitors. According to comScore, Homes.com unique visitors were up 153% year-over-year in March, Realtor.com's monthly unique visitors decreased by 20%. Zillow's unique visitors were down 5% and Redfin's traffic increased 5% compared to March of last year. <br/>Alongside our increase in consumer traffic engagement, agent engagement continues to improve. We now have approximately 1.1 million agents registered in Homes.com network, up 37% for the first quarter of '22. Active users are those who visit the site monthly have increased 64% versus last year. I believe the engagement will continue to improve as we're providing millions of free leads to agents that could generate billions of commission dollars for them under our \"your listing, your lead\" business model. In the months ahead, we're intensely focused on product development, generating proprietary content and building consumer traffic. Our team is extremely talented and singularly focused on winning. I wish I could share more detail on some of the great success stories, but I cannot, for competitive reasons. With the progress we've made to date, I remain confident that we're on track to begin monetizing Homes.com advertising product in the later part of this year. <br/>LoopNet was 63 -- revenue was $63 million for the first quarter, up 16% year-over-year and accelerating from 12% growth rate in the fourth quarter of '22. Our investment in building a direct sales force for LoopNet's paying off. Net new bookings are up 100% year-over-year, which is directly attributable to our larger and more effective sales teams. The productivity for sellers in the first year has increased in each of the last 4 quarters as new reps ramp and become more productive. Sales of new signature ads are up 27% year-over-year. LoopNet captured record traffic in the quarter with 14 million average monthly unique visitors to a network of marketplaces, up 12% year-over-year. <br/>According to Semrush, LoopNet has 8x the traffic of our nearest competitor in March. We're also seeing traffic gains in Canada as our unique visitors for LoopNet Canada in the first quarter are over 5x the unique visitors of our nearest competitor there. These accomplishments and investments reinforce our position as the most popular place to find a space and give me confidence in our ability to achieve our target of 18% to 19% revenue growth in 2023. <br/>As we continue to focus on international expansion with our revenues, they are expected to exceed $80 million in 2023. By revenue, our international business now ranks #4, behind Apartments.com, CoStar and LoopNet. We now have over 500 international employees, including 200 researchers and 130 sales representatives. In Europe, we currently operate more than a dozen cities in 5 countries, with aspirations to expand our CoStar and LoopNet products into most of these major markets. Currently, CoStar and LoopNet are only offered in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom. We believe there's a $30 billion European market for real estate information, services and marketplaces, which is roughly the same size as our North American market. <br/>A key step to capturing a significant share of that market is building and selling CoStar and LoopNet on a pan-European basis. One of the core unique competencies of our research operations is our on-the-ground field research operations. Our goal over the next few years is to photograph, map and document all of the commercial properties, 10,000 square feet or larger, roughly 1,000 square meters, in 15 European countries and approximately 36 cities. We will divide each city into 1 kilometer grids and capture all the relevant building inventory in each area. We anticipate capturing information on more than 1.5 million properties with a combined value in the trillions of euros. We have done this before in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. And in each instance, these massive efforts have resulted in a profitable and very valuable information asset. <br/>CoStar revenue increased $225 million in the first quarter, up 13%. For each month of the quarter, we saw a record number of distinct users in CoStar and in March exceeded 140,000 distinct users. Usage of CoStar and product engagement continues to grow as evidenced by nearly 6.5 million logins in the first quarter, a 26% increase over the last year. During those user sessions, property searches exceeded 20 million each month, and property detail views averaged 15 million a month. Whilst CoStar continues to be the premier product for real estate professionals -- brokers, significant opportunities exist for selling to new customers. We have a 75% plus penetration rate amongst brokerages with 5 or more brokers and continue to prospect smaller firms with an annual revenue potential of $96 million. <br/>In addition, our sales teams are focused on owners, lenders and corporations where we have a significant addressable market. We believe we have over 51,000 owner prospects, 10,000 lender prospects and almost 4,000 corporations or 50 or more locations for a total of $1.4 billion in potential revenue. For the first time this quarter, product demonstrations to these aforementioned prospects exceeded those to the broker customers and broker prospects. Overall, we're seeing slightly lower than -- slightly lower net new bookings for CoStar, but still expect double-digit revenue growth in 2023. <br/>We've (inaudible) corporate information on 12,600 real estate investment funds and 70,000 commercial properties within those funds into CoStar. The subfund information helps clients understand who has capital available to invest in the commercial real estate and what sort of product types they want to invest in and where they want to invest. We continue to focus on our banking customers with our lender product. Last month marked the 1-year anniversary of releasing our fully integrated solution for lenders in CoStar. <br/>Sales continued to be strong in Q1, ending our first year by breaking the 150 total client milestone. These clients spend many lender types, including banks, life insurance companies, credit unions and private lenders while ranging in size from $50 million CRE portfolios to over $50 billion CRE portfolios, proving a large opportunity moving forward. Our sales pipeline for lender is strong, and we expect to build on that pipeline as the solution for lenders is uniquely positioned for continued growth in this uncertain environment. <br/>The value proposition is unmatched. No other company can connect a lender's portfolio to our rich property level information and provide a fully integrated credit model that assesses refinance risks as well as stress test a portfolio for an economic downturn. We expect continued sales opportunities due to regulators calling for increased portfolio surveillance by CRE-focused lenders for multiple reasons, including the concern over office properties, rising rates, refinancing risks and the threat of a potential economic downturn. I remain confident in our ability to grow CoStar revenue given our mission-critical data, ongoing product enhancements and the continued expansion and diversification of our customer base. <br/>Although overall CRE transaction volume was down 51% year-over-year, Ten-X continues to outperform the market with a solid 60% trade rate, up 3x that of the off-line market and up 51% in the fourth quarter of '22. We also saw the average number of bidders per auction on the platform increased over 3.2 in the first quarter compared to 2.6 in the fourth quarter of '22. In Q1 '23, Ten-X saw the average asset value increased 18% over the last year from $3.3 million to $3.9 million, average winning bid price increased 29% compared to the prior year from $3.1 million up to $4 million, and the average buyer premium increased 35% over the last year from 71,000 to 97,000. I believe this indicates that our expanded sales force is delivering higher quality assets that investors are seeking even in a price-challenged market. <br/>With roughly $1.5 trillion of CRE debt maturing in the next 24 months and $700 billion maturing by year-end, we expect the continued interest rate-driven market shift to drive transaction volume up. Ten-X is already seeing an increase in momentum in the second quarter with $1.7 billion of inventory come into the platform, a 44% increase from Q2 of '22. <br/>Ten-X remains the go-to platform for accelerated asset transactions which buyers, sellers, brokers, lenders and special servicers benefit from as the markets continue to shift. Our lands business is focused on creating opportunities for our [real land] clients to capture more leads for their priority properties for sale with signature ad opportunities. This business continues its consistent profitable growth with 14% year-over-year revenue growth. <br/>STR has achieved a record sales quarter with the highest net new in its history and delivered 14% year-over-year revenue growth on a constant currency basis compared to the first quarter of '22. We're on track to launch our new benchmarking product this month and execute our plan of migrating more than 175,000 users to the CoStar platform. This release will open access to new clients, including owners, hotel operators and brands that will enable execution of our integrated strategy. <br/>Owners will have clearer visibility into asset performance, market performance and competitive landscape. This insight is invaluable for asset acquisition, repositioning and dispositioning. Operators will have access to data and tools to better forecast, budget, yield manage and identify demand drivers and supply implications. Hotel brands will have a full suite to support and develop teams, franchise owners relationships and management contracts. What's not to love about all that? <br/>Overall, higher interest rates and increased economic uncertainty have reduced transaction volumes in the market and impacted prices since the second half of '22. As I mentioned earlier, transaction volumes declined by over 50% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2023 in the commercial real estate markets. In addition, we're now seeing asset price declines for 7 consecutive months with valuations off by 8% over that time. The office sector continues to show real weakness with vacancy rates reaching almost 13% in the first quarter. Phantom vacancy rate is much higher than that, and it's matching the all-time peak seen after the great financial crisis. <br/>With continued weak demand, negative net absorption and other 58 million square feet of deliveries expected in 2023, we expect vacancies to push higher for the foreseeable future. Not surprisingly, delinquency rates on commercial property loans have doubled in the past 3 months to 2.8%, and it's probably and actually higher than that. Overall sales prices for office buildings are down 26% from their peak in Q1 of 2022. Fortunately, our Ten-X platform is well positioned to assist with the recapitalization of those properties as they come to market. <br/>The residential housing market remains constrained. Mortgage rates are down from the earlier highs at the end of last year, but affordability is still low by historical standards. Sales of existing homes tipped higher earlier this year after 12 consecutive months of declines. Sales of new homes have trended higher since reaching a bottom last year as builders are offering incentives like rate buydowns to clear inventories. Inventories remain tight, which should prevent values from declining rapidly. <br/>The retail sector continues to benefit from reduced store closures, steady demand and minimal new supply. Available retail space fell to a new all-time low of 4.7% during the first quarter, leaving it difficult to find space a strong market. Industrial net absorption has slowed in the first quarter after 2 years of record high net absorption, and tenant demand is beginning to moderate. At 4.3%, the U.S. industrial vacancy rate is half of the levels recorded 10 years ago, and rents have climbed 10% over the last 12 months, still a strong market. <br/>I'm very pleased with the performance of our business in the first quarter. CoStar continues to grow and remain resilient despite industry headwinds elsewhere. Apartments.com and LoopNet show accelerating countercyclical sales success. I am very optimistic about the progress we're making building traffic and value at Homes.com. We're very pleased to see our array of diverse platforms drawing more than 94 million unique visitors in March, and I look forward to reporting 100 million unique visitors before too long. <br/>At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to the very capable hands of our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Wheeler.",
			"<strong>Scott T. Wheeler</strong>",
			"Thank you, Andy. It's a great way to start the year again. Financially, we are certainly on track, if not slightly ahead, where we expected to be this quarter and for the year, with regards to revenue and our revenue growth outlook, which is a 13% total revenue growth for 2023. Now one of our sell-side analysts recently pointed out that we have logged 50 quarters in a row of double-digit revenue growth, although we actually just completed 48 consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth, but who's counting? I actually use my favorite AI tool, which I call an Excel spreadsheet, to go back and figure out how many actual quarters we had double-digit growth. So it was back in 2011. So I am applying AI here at CoStar to our financial results.",
			"<strong>Andrew C. Florance</strong>",
			"It might just be I.",
			"<strong>Scott T. Wheeler</strong>",
			"The question of my I sometimes. So revenue by services, CoStar revenue grew 13% in the first quarter. It was in line with our guidance expectations. CoStar expansion into new customers remain strong with new business sales consistently or slightly above the levels we've seen since mid-2021 after the pandemic. The brokers are certainly facing a tough transaction and leasing environment which dampened new broker sales and renewal rates, primarily among the very small broker shops. <br/>We expect that our revenue forecast will reflect the current market conditions, which would have CoStar revenue growing at 10% for the second quarter and for the full year of 2023. For multifamily, we added more than $35 million in year-over-year revenue during the first quarter, on our way to once again achieving 20% revenue growth. Our bigger sales team is giving us the capacity to reach more and more prospective customers that have never advertised for Apartments.com. The number of paid properties increased by 8% in the first quarter of 2023 on a year-over-year basis. This is the largest volume increase we've seen since the second quarter of 2021. <br/>In addition, we're seeing more and more customers upgrading to higher-level ads versus those that are downgrading to lower-level ads. This net revenue contribution from the positive ad level mix is now back to the levels we saw last during the pandemic surge, which was the second quarter of 2020, which were certainly good, strong high levels. Looking ahead, we expect these trends to continue with rising vacancy rates and increased productivity from our recent sales force expansion classes. So we're now forecasting revenue growth, as Andy said, of 23% for multifamily for the year and for the second quarter, up from our prior guidance of 20% revenue growth for 2023. <br/>LoopNet revenue grew 16% in the first quarter, up from 12% revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2022, thanks to the success of our dedicated LoopNet sales team. We expect 18% revenue growth for LoopNet in the second quarter of 2023 with a full year revenue growth that we now expect at the upper end of our 18% to 19% guidance range. Revenue from Information Services increased 12% in the first quarter at the upper end of the guidance range with strong results from STR and revenue contributions from our growing European businesses. <br/>We expect revenue growth for both the second quarter and the full year of 2023 to be 10%, slightly above the 7% to 9% full year revenue growth guidance range that we provided in February. Our first quarter residential revenue came in at $13 million as expected. Estimated revenue for the second quarter is around $12 million, with our full year '23 revenue expectations remaining unchanged at $45 million. As a reminder, we've not assumed any revenues from Homes.com advertising products in our 2023 outlook. <br/>Other marketplace revenue contracted 4% in the first quarter of 2023, which was actually an improvement from the 10% to 13% first quarter revenue decline we expected a few months ago, as the trade rates for Ten-X that improved sequentially in the first quarter providing the extra revenue versus our forecast. We now expect revenue from other marketplaces to grow in the mid- to high single digits in the second quarter, and we're increasing our full year revenue growth estimate to 11% to 12% based on the better-than-expected first quarter results. <br/>Adjusted EBITDA was $123 million in the first quarter, $7 million above the high end of our guidance range. The outperformance was primarily attributable to our strong revenue performance and the timing of marketing spend in the quarter, which we expect to reverse as we move into our peak marketing season in the second and third quarters. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 21% in the first quarter, 1 percentage point higher than our guidance. <br/>The size of the sales force in total remains largely unchanged from where we were at the end of 2022. The Apartments and LoopNet Marketplace teams grew in the first quarter sequentially, offset by modest attrition across the rest of the sales force. Our focus for the rest of 2023 is to continue to increase our sales teams in the marketplace businesses, including Apartments, LoopNet, Lands and Residential. Our contract renewal rates remain in the 90% to 91% range, while the renewal rate in the first quarter for customers who have been subscribers for 5 years or longer remained strong at 95%. <br/>Subscription revenue on annual contracts increased to 82% for the first quarter of '23, up from 81% at the end of 2022 and 80% a year ago. Both CoStar and Apartments.com have our highest annual subscription concentration percentages. And as these 2 products grow in relative size, we see our total subscription percentage increasing along with it. With a strong start to the year, we are reconfirming our revenue guidance and raising the midpoint of our guidance range. The new revenue range of $2.465 billion to $2.48 billion implies revenue growth of 13% to 14% for the year. <br/>Second quarter 2023 revenue is expected to range from $603 million to $608 million, representing revenue growth of approximately 13% at the midpoint. We are also reconfirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance and raising the midpoint of our guidance range. The new adjusted EBITDA forecast range is now $505 million to $520 million. Our investments in the Homes.com residential marketplace are yielding excellent results, and our investment plans remains unchanged from what we communicated in February. For the second quarter of 2023, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $118 million to $123 million, indicating a second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 20%. <br/>Before we move to Q&amp;A, I want to reassure everyone that our cash and our investments are safe and sound, with no adverse impacts from the failure of the Silicon Valley Bank and the other recent banking turmoils. We also have nothing related to First Republic Bank, by the way. We maintain a very conservative treasury strategy that keeps our cash with only the strongest financial institutions and in the safest short-term investments. We actively manage our deposits to maximize interest income within the confines of our low-risk investment practices. <br/>In the first quarter, our $5.1 billion of cash earned a net interest of approximately 4.1% for the quarter, producing approximately $44 million of net interest income after deducting the interest expense on our debt. Projecting these results for the rest of the year is expected to yield net interest income of approximately $195 million, which is well above our prior estimates. We're raising our outlook for non-GAAP net income per diluted share to include our latest estimate of net interest income. We now expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $1.21 to $1.24, an increase from our prior guidance of around 15%, which is $0.15 per diluted share at the midpoint. <br/>So that about wraps it up for me. You can see we're in a very strong financial position as we head into the second quarter. And our growth, our investment and our profit plans are all on track for another great year. <br/>So with that, I will now turn the call back over to our operator for a little bit of Q&amp;A. Hannah, back to you.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs.",
			"<strong>Keen Fai Tong</strong>",
			"You trimmed your CoStar Suite full year revenue growth guidance from 12% to 10%. How derisked is that outlook given the current state of the commercial real estate market? And then related to that, you mentioned smaller broker weakness. Can you comment on the performance of your other customer types at CoStar Suite as well as the latest pricing trends that you're realizing?",
			"<strong>Scott T. Wheeler</strong>",
			"Sure, George. Thanks for the question. So we do take a quick -- a close look at all of our different customer sectors and how we're performing. As I mentioned, the sales that we're making into the growth sectors, owners, investors, lenders are at, if not slightly above the levels we've been doing over the last 4 to 6 quarters. And you just really see this one isolated sector that is the smallest broker shops that are being impacted by the downturn in transactions and reduction in effort and potential layoffs in that industry. <br/>So we've taken a close look at that. We reflect those trends. We think that the second and third quarters are going to be rough in the industry. I think those are pretty well known economically. And so we ride along with that sort of expectation and would hope that it starts to get better in the latter part of the year. So we build all that into our forecast and we see that reflected in the 10%. <br/>So with the number of sectors holding up as strong as we have and with the bigger sales force, we don't see this as being something that would be as disruptive as what happened in the pandemic or anything previous for us. So we're pretty confident with what we've got built in so far. <br/>And then question on pricing. Yes, we're following -- we follow inflation level pricing. So our -- as inflation levels come down, then we reduce the increases that we put in for renewals to just stay at the rate of inflation. And that's all (inaudible) forecast.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question is from the line of Peter Christiansen with Citi.",
			"<strong>Peter Corwin Christiansen</strong>",
			"Andy, just wondering, can you elaborate a little bit on how you're seeing the pipeline for Ten-X, the relationships that you've built, I guess, since acquiring the asset, and how you see that pipeline evolving, I guess, as potentially we hit more distress over the coming months, years? How do you see that evolving versus how Ten-X was prior to being acquired?",
			"<strong>Andrew C. Florance</strong>",
			"So surprisingly, still today, the vast majority of product that's trading on the platform is performing assets. So we are -- it takes quite some time for when market conditions become adverse to when you actually see effectively capitulation and people begin to exit investments that have gone south. So we're still a performing asset platform at this point, but we're seeing less spread between buyer expectations and seller expectations. So there's the trade rates are coming up. You can see the volume increasing this quarter as that happens. And we would expect that to continue to climb up through the year. <br/>We have a much larger sales organization than we've had in the past to be able to capture that opportunity. Plus, we've also completely integrated all of the systems of Ten-X into the CoStar and LoopNet platforms. So we're dramatically more efficient as we want to take on new assets. We also are more disciplined now on making sure that we do not bring on any assets that the seller does not have realistic expectations for. <br/>So our commitment committee on the Ten-X management team is very disciplined. So it's somewhat awkward. You don't want to see a flood of inventory coming into Ten-X because it means that the market has gone really south. But with the federal government continuing to work from home, you'll probably see a lot of office assets go down.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question is from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair.",
			"<strong>Stephen Hardy Sheldon</strong>",
			"LoopNet, really strong booking trends there. So do you think you're at full stride there with the expanded sales force? Or is there still a lot more to go, I guess, in terms of ramping productivity? And then can you talk about the demand environment in LoopNet given the trend in office vacancy rates? It seems like a great environment right now. But do you also think that you could be a point where vacancy rates trend too high, some property owners capitulate and just assume they're not going to find tenants and therefore, reduce ad spend? And I guess essentially, is there an optimal range for office vacancy rates from your perspective to maximize demand at LoopNet? And if so, what do you think that is?",
			"<strong>Andrew C. Florance</strong>",
			"Yes. I don't think there's an upper end. What we see in the past -- so we've been selling advertising solutions to commercial property owners for quite some time now, from when it was in books to when it was in CD ROMs, to when it's on the Internet. And when the market conditions get really awful at the upper end of high vacancy rates, what you find is that the assets recapitalized, a new owner comes in at a much lower cost basis. The cost of our advertising is de minimis or irrelevant in the cost -- the context of the cost of the building, and they're actually very aggressive in advertising. <br/>So the biggest advertising spend I've ever seen is from owners who picked up bankrupt assets, new owners have picked up. And they're basically coming in there with lower price points than the remaining properties that hadn't yet gone under because they've got a lower cost basis. So I think there's no -- I don't believe that there's any upper end to vacancy rate and demand for our asset, LoopNet. Obviously, right when someone's going bankrupt, they stop, but it's made up for by now the new owner coming in aggressively. <br/>I actually think we have a lot of room to go. I look at 1 or 2 other businesses overseas, and I look at what they're generating in revenue for commercial real estate advertising on the Internet. And just interpolate that by GDP, and it suggests we have a doubling, tripling, quadrupling of revenue to go. So I'm looking forward to continuing to grow the LoopNet sales force and continue to optimize our pricing models and to increase the functionality. And I also think that moving LoopNet pan-European will have a huge benefit. <br/>I spent a lot of time listening to focus group interviews with corporate users and investors who move across borders. And as we provide a solution that crosses borders, I think that will increase demand for assets marketed on LoopNet, which would be another positive demand driver. So if you can't tell, I'm bullish on LoopNet and remain bullish on LoopNet.",

			"The next question is from John Campbell with Stephens.",
			"<strong>John Robert Campbell</strong>",
			"The first one is -- I guess a 2-part question here. So first off, a great job on the Homes.com traffic ramp. That was a really impressive early start for you guys. So first, on the roughly $53 million of sequential step-up in sales and marketing, how much of that was tied to resi?",
			"<strong>Scott T. Wheeler</strong>",
			"Yes. So we haven't indicated how much residential marketing spend, as you can appreciate, John. So I think you see every sequential quarter, we'll get more and more marketing coming in total as all of our marketplaces get into the more of the rental and high-volume seasons in the second and third quarter. But we'll just keep the discussion to overall company at this stage.",
			"<strong>John Robert Campbell</strong>",
			"Okay. And I guess, just broadly, you're expecting that sales and marketing step up sequentially throughout the remainder of the year, even into 4Q.",
			"<strong>Scott T. Wheeler</strong>",
			"Yes. So I think what you'll see is our pattern will step up in second quarter. We're going to step up even more in third as we get closer to our product launch in residential. Then you'll see clearly we'll be preparing the market for that. And then I think what we'll see is the fourth quarter will be higher than most of our fourth quarters previously because we have an additional platform that we're doing brand marketing for now this year versus prior years. So you see a bit more of a spend that carries in later in the year than we've had before because of the addition of the new platform. So hopefully, that helps.",
			"<strong>Andrew C. Florance</strong>",
			"But if you see anyone from (inaudible), tell them we're spending all the money in Madrid.",
			"<strong>John Robert Campbell</strong>",
			"Will do. And then, Andy, back -- I guess big picture question for resi. As you look out the next couple of quarters, what would you offer up as key milestones you'd like to see the team hit?",
			"<strong>Andrew C. Florance</strong>",
			"Well, for the next -- there's a lot going on. I mean it is a very full plate of initiatives, and there's well over 1,000 people working on the initiative right now. I think that the traffic numbers remain a key metric that we're watching, obviously. As we mentioned, we plan to begin to monetize the platform at the very end of the year. And the first 1,000 customers on that platform are probably the most important customers that you may 1 day have hundreds of thousands or millions. The first 1,000, the most important. But I would stay with -- I would just stay with the simple traffic numbers. <br/>Now I believe that critical traffic numbers are what we talked about before, 25 million, which we've crossed, 50 million, which we're moving towards. Beyond that 50 million mark, you really have what you need to produce some compelling marketing solutions for your clients, and you can really begin to monetize. So I think the numbers correctly -- you correctly observed that I would say that one of the biggest risk factors for Homes.com has just been reduced with these results today, if you're watching.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question is from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC.",
			"<strong>Ashish Sabadra</strong>",
			"I just wanted to drill down further on the CoStar Suite. I was wondering if you can quantify what percentage of the revenue really comes from the smaller midsized brokers where you might potentially see any kind of headwinds. <br/>And then just to follow up, Andy, on your comment around the prospects, owners, lenders and corporations, which represents a $1.4 billion opportunity. I was wondering how much percentage of the revenue comes from those right now. And how should we think about that trajectory for the rest of the year but also over the next few years?",
			"<strong>Scott T. Wheeler</strong>",
			"So let me take the first part of that question there, Ashish. When you look at our broker mix, in CoStar, a little over 35% of our CoStar revenue is from the broker pool, and then about 25% of that group is representative of small, what we call the 1 or 2 broker set. So that gives you 25% or 35%. So it's roughly 8% of that pool. So it's pretty limited exposure for now in the small broker set.",
			"<strong>Andrew C. Florance</strong>",
			"And to be clear, they don't all go away. It's really -- having watched this a few times, it's the folks who are 67 years old who decide to step out at the cycle point. So it's a subset of the group. And there's some -- obviously, some other constituencies. So the majority of our revenue today is the owners, lenders, and a smaller component is the corporate users. Obviously, we have government in there. We have vendors. We have a whole number of other sectors. <br/>I believe that the -- while the brokerage side of our business continues to grow, I believe that those owner, lender, corporate user sectors are going to be, by far, the biggest growth driver and coupled with international demand over the next 3 to 4 years. So I think this is a trend that's been going on for 2 decades now. So I think when we went public, 85%, 90% of our revenue was brokers. So while that revenues continue to grow, it's now only 35%. So as it continues to grow, I'd anticipate 5 years from now, it will only be 15% -- 10%, 15% of our revenue, something like that.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question is from the line of Mayank Tandon with Needham.",
			"<strong>Mayank Tandon</strong>",
			"Andy, of the 15 countries -- or was it cities that you mentioned the focal point in Europe, is that going to be an organic initiative? Or do you think you could buy assets in these regions that could help accelerate the traction there to be able to penetrate that $30 billion opportunity? And when should we expect meaningful revenue contribution from this initiative?",
			"<strong>Andrew C. Florance</strong>",
			"Yes. So there definitely are acquisition opportunities in Europe. There are very few companies that -- in Europe that -- like none that do exactly what we do in the CoStar information side. They're more on the marketplace side, similar to LoopNet or to Homes.com. There's not a lot of Apartments.com players over there. But on the CoStar side, we really stand alone. One of the key initiatives is to build the comprehensive information grid by doing the field research and proactive research that is a 2- to 3-year process. So then you see meaningful monetization on the CoStar side really 2 to 3 years out. <br/>On the LoopNet side or on the marketplace side, I think it would be a little bit sooner, probably 18 months or so. But we have our head down doing what we've done many times before, which is capturing the whole -- all the content, the core content. And the wonderful thing is we seem to be the only people in the world that like to go out and do something that hard and crazy, and then it becomes very valuable once we go and do it. We're pretty good at it. <br/>And the wonderful thing is the technology has never been better than it is today to do what we do when we build inventory. So we can use machine vision now to look at aerial photographs, compare them to the millions and millions of other properties and aerial photographs we've got. We can very precisely direct our field researchers and make them very, very efficient as they move through these markets. <br/>So it will be a good adventure, and I think there'll be some great returns for it. And I remain convinced that the market for -- the demand for Ten markets is 20x the demand for (inaudible).",

			"<strong>Jeffrey Marc Silber</strong>",
			"This is, I guess, a follow-up from the prior question. You've obviously got a sizable cash balance. It's great to see that you're generating more interest income off of there. But when do you think you might put that cash balance to work? And where would that cash balance be working?",
			"<strong>Andrew C. Florance</strong>",
			"I think we -- I believe that our organic initiatives are not going to exceed our EBITDA generation or cash flow generation. We don't see anything like that at this point. So it's really acquisition opportunities. We're -- we have been very patient. We believe that there's better value opportunities. And as I listened to Scott describe $5.1 billion in cash, I believe it's a wonderful time to have a great balance sheet as other companies may run into some troubles. <br/>And so both in Europe and the United States, we believe there are opportunities. We continue to have conversations. You probably have read in the media about a number of conversations we have had that were substantive. We did take a 4-week holiday from -- after the latest round of media reports, but there's still a lot out there. And I have meetings this week, but you won't know where.",

			"The next question is from Heather Balsky with Bank of America.",
			"<strong>Heather Nicole Balsky</strong>",
			"I appreciate you taking my question. I'd love to ask you about the residential piece. You talked about where you are on a traffic basis. There's less risk going forward. I know you're not kind of telling us specifically your sort of spending plans for this year and beyond this year. But if things continue to progress at the rate they do and the pace they do, kind of how do you see things evolving at a high level? Can you just kind of help us kind of see your path between now and 2027?",
			"<strong>Andrew C. Florance</strong>",
			"Heather, are you specifically talking about investments or combination of investments and traffic?",
			"<strong>Heather Nicole Balsky</strong>",
			"Well, I guess the investment side and how it's tied to your thoughts around how sales progress.",
			"<strong>Andrew C. Florance</strong>",
			"Yes. So I think this -- the remainder of this year, I believe, is fairly predictable. People have a good idea of what we're doing the remainder of this year. The wonderful thing is, is that we have pulled just a small percentage of the levers we have to grow traffic. So some of the things that I think are -- I think there's more traffic generation opportunities ahead of us this year that we -- than those that are behind us. So it makes me feel pretty good about our ability to hit our second traffic goal as the year comes to a close or just slightly thereafter, which would be way out of schedule. <br/>I'm very excited about our simple monetization strategy at the tail end of this year. I think it's straightforward. I think it's compelling. And I think we can spin up a sales operation to support it pretty quickly. As we -- my hope is that as we can begin to show proof of concept against that sales initiative in the later part of the year, going into '24, then we can do what we did with Apartments.com where we are showing proof of concept and results and invest against that proof of concept and result into what is a huge market. <br/>So it's too early to say what we're doing in '24, '25, '26 and '27 for investments. It will be a balance between what we're showing in revenue results versus what we're willing to invest into the business. So -- but it's probably 60%, 70% of my time right now. And I'm pleased with where it's going. And it's a lot of work, but we have a great team and feel pretty good about it. But obviously, we're the underdog as we were in the early days of Apartments.com. And so you have to be coming up with some unique ideas and different strategies. And I think I feel pretty good about that what we've got going on.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question is from Ryan Tomasello with Stifel (sic) [KBW].",
			"<strong>Ryan John Tomasello</strong>",
			"Just 2-part one here. Clearly, a lot of confidence in the resiliency of the business. But just given uncertainty that's out there around macro and CRE, it'd just be helpful to hear your thoughts around your willingness to pull expense levers under the scenario that the sales environment does weaken more than you're hoping. <br/>And as a follow-up on the Homes.com traffic trends, maybe you could elaborate a bit more, Andy, on what levers you've leaned on so far to drive that traffic growth in terms of, I guess, SEO, SEM, synergies with apartments and what remaining levers you have to pull that you just alluded to.",
			"<strong>Andrew C. Florance</strong>",
			"Yes. So I don't think we want to go into too much detail on our traffic strategies right now just for competitive reasons. I would point out that we have the greenest residential real estate portal around because our load time with the homepages ranges from 4 milliseconds to something like 30 -- 24 milliseconds. So that gives us a BA on Google Analytics for performance time, which means you consume less electricity and generate less carbon, and we only generate 0.22 grams per 10,000 loads. <br/>So super efficient, high performance is a key piece that we've done. And I hope that obfuscates what we're doing in strategy for traffic. But I think we've talked about some of those traffic strategies, and some of it self-evident like what we haven't yet done, which we're going to be doing, and the things that we've done in apartments that are in the past successfully that we've talked about today that have not yet been done with homes that are self-evident. So yes, there's more ahead than there is in the rearview mirror on the traffic performance. But congrats to Jerry Rodgers and his team for such great performance that benefits your SEO growth. <br/>So -- and our willingness to -- if the market continues to degrade significantly, sure, we're always responsive to any need to sort of pull back on initiatives where we're not seeing a market perform because of severe economic conditions. We are prepared to do cost containment efforts. But realistically, in the very worst markets over the last 35 years, we've rarely seen -- I think the worst we ever saw was a 2%, 3% decline when we were only selling CoStar to brokers. We are so much more diverse now, and we have so many what I believe are countercyclical drivers, whether it be lender or Ten-X or marketing for high asset value items that I think it's unlikely that we'd be in a situation where we have to really pull back because of the economy. Though I'm quite impressed by this particular down cycle and the potential.",
			"<strong>Scott T. Wheeler</strong>",
			"Yes. Well, you noticed -- I mean we look very closely at the last disruptions that happened, the pandemic in '20 and the great financial crisis more than a decade ago. And as you proceed through each of those, you noticed in the last down cycle that our revenue growth didn't slow at all, and we see nothing even as disruptive of that this time. And you just look what's happening with Apartments and LoopNet proving to overbalance countercyclical that our revenue growth is not going to slow at this balance in a down cycle, and we don't see that coming at all. And we do see a lot of clear data underneath, as you might suspect, on what's going on. So our portfolio is much stronger as even 3 years ago, and I think we saw that in the results that we announced today.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"There are no additional questions waiting at this time. So I will turn the call over to Andy to wrap it up -- wrap the call up.",
			"<strong>Andrew C. Florance</strong>",
			"Wow. We finished 7 minutes early. Well, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us for our first quarter '23 earnings call.

			"Thank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to Alexandria's first quarter '23 Earnings Call. With me today are Peter, Dean, Hallie and Dan. And first of all, I want to send a big thank you to our entire ARE family team for an operationally and financially strong first quarter in a continuing tough macro environment. <br/>As you know, Alexandria is truly a one-of-a-kind S&amp;P 500 company. And we're very pleased that we just received one of Newsweek's most trusted company awards. We have no peers. We're kind of a pure play in our field. We first identified and pioneered the lab space niche back in 1994. And then through our disciplined execution of our original vision using the strategic architecture of our cluster model which we customize to the life science industry. <br/>We have brought the mission-critical real estate infrastructure of the life science industry and integrated it with an unparalleled and world-class 24/7 operational excellence service component aimed to protect the hundreds of billions of dollars of leading-edge science, which is conducted 24/7 within our asset base. And we have brought this to a highly respected and recognized real estate product type today. Alexandria is definitely not a healthcare service facilities company nor a generic office company.<br/>Our disciplined core focus is our patented and trademark lab space. It's a premium priced, noncommodity product generally characterized by high barrier to entry markets, where we have a dominant franchise and where we exercise pricing power, especially in our highly sought after Alexandria-branded mega campuses, and those markets exhibit deep science base, deep life science talent base, a rich abundance of risk capital and also are ones that are generally safe and have excellent transportation access. <br/>And what we saw in 1994 in the embryonic days of the life science industry is multiplied geometrically today, 30 years later, as Steve Jobs said, the 21st century will be the century of the intersection of biology and technology innovation. We have 10,000 known diseases we can havoc on human beings each and every day and the personal and economic cost of sickness, illness and today, the mental health crisis is continuing to skyrocket. <br/>Continued innovation in medicine is an absolute national priority and the transformative work of our tenants in the industry is critical to addressing the massive unmet medical need. Literally every day, we hear of great progress. And today, for example, one of our Greater Boston tenants, Morphic Therapeutic which has an oral drug addressing moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. And if you've ever had it, it is a tough condition, a major GI indication announced that it hit its Phase IIa clinical trial endpoint and their stock has been up 75% this year. The 10 most prevalent diseases in the U.S., heart disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, obesity, Alzheimer's, diabetes, substance abuse, infectious disease, chronic kidney disease and mental illness are not being solved to date. We have a large mountain decline, and the industry is really in its formative days. <br/>Weathering a tough macro environment, ARE posted a very solid first quarter. Our funds FFO per share is up 7%, as you see in revenues, top line revenue is up almost 14%. And Dean will go into the metrics, but almost 100% collections, which is -- bodes well for our continued strength and stability of the company. We've maintained strong guidance while lowering uses and sources of capital. We've had very solid leasing with the highest-ever rental rate increase, and we've had continuing strong operating and EBITDA margins. All stakeholders should recognize and appreciate this management team took a highly disciplined approach over a multiyear period to create a fortress balance sheet to successfully weather what now is the current self-inflected economic storm by the various policies that we implemented over the last many years. <br/>We have taken judicious measure to cut our CapEx, while at the same time, making strong progress on our funding plan for 2023, and you'll hear more about that from Peter. So without any further hesitation, let me turn it over to Hallie, who's going to give you some bird's-eye view of our view on the life science industry. So Hallie?",
			"<strong>Hallie Kuhn</strong>",
			"Thank you, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, Senior Vice President of Science and Technology and Capital Markets. Today, I'm going to comment on the life science industry following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. The health of ARE's best-in-class life science tenant base and innovation is a long-term driver of life science industry growth. Beginning with SVB, there remains some misperceptions on the long-term impact of its collapse on the life science industry. <br/>SVB certainly was a go-to provider for banking needs of many venture-backed companies, particularly in the tech industry. And while SVB has created a niche serving the segment, it was also cultural. Early-stage start-ups work within a very tightened community and many used SVB because that's what everyone else used, not necessarily because there were no other options. And many banks, including G-SIBs have been working for years to carve out their own share of this market.<br/>For our own private biotech tenants in the days following the collapse, we had conversations with over 100 companies. some of which use SVB, but many of which did not or had multiple banking relationships. Importantly, within approximately 72 hours from the start of the bank run, companies had access to all deposits and the near-term risks such as making payroll were mitigated. As for long-term risk driven by instability of regional banks, unlike some tech companies that maintain significant cash and deposit accounts, our tenants largely rely on safer third-party custodial and sweep accounts to minimize cash deposits. Biotech is also not reliant on venture debt to the same extent as the tech industry. <br/>And for those that do seek venture debt, SVB is by no means the only option. We expect that the life science sector will be minimally affected going forward as evidenced by venture financing rounds that closed in March is expected and continue to do so in April, which I'll touch on in more detail shortly. Before transitioning to the health of our tenant base, one quick reminder on the differentiation of our life science real estate product from traditional office. Importantly, the office component of our life science buildings directly supports researchers in the lab. <br/>A scientist does not spend all day at the bench, but spends time moving back and forth between lab and adjacent office in order to, for example, analyze data, plan the next set of experiments and meet with colleagues. Thus, the office component cannot be broken out or compared to traditional office, but is an adjacent, highly integrated and critical component of laboratory design and workflows. Of course, this is also not work that can be done from home. <br/>Now transitioning to the health of our world-class diverse life science tenant base. Perhaps the best way to frame the current environment is the old adage, \"In God we trust, all else bring data.\" Starting with pharma, which makes up 18% of our ARR, this segment continues to operate from a position of strength with strong balance sheet and significant free cash flows, Pharma is less sensitive to rising rates. <br/>In 2022, Biopharma deployed an estimated $267 billion into R&amp;D. The result is tenants like Eli Lilly that continue to translate this R&amp;D into transformative medicines. Mounjaro, which aims to treat obesity in type 2 diabetes, is predicted to eclipse $50 billion per year globally in revenue. And to put this in perspective, nearly one out of every $4 of U.S. healthcare spend is deployed to care for people with diabetes. And obesity is estimated to account for over $480 billion in direct healthcare costs in the U.S. with an additional $1.2 trillion in indirect costs due to lost economic productivity. <br/>To that end, therapies such as Mounjaro, save and extend lives and have the potential to significantly drive down the cost of healthcare more broadly. Transitioning to private venture-backed biotech which makes up 8% of our total ARR, we continue to see a reset of venture deployment to pre-2020, 2021 levels, which while down from peak remains strong by historic standards. <br/>Venture capitalists are more discriminate, disciplined and demanding of current and future investments. And the companies with tenured management teams and strong differentiated technologies and near-term value inflection milestones are the ones that rise above the fray. We continue to underwrite and monitor all tenants closely, and our private biotech tenants remain healthy compared to the broader market. <br/>In fact, across this tenant base, they have raised over $1.9 billion from VC and pharma partnerships since the beginning of the year, of which $800 million has closed following the collapse of SVB. As a testament to this point, with the week remaining in April, private biotech tenant rent collection is at 99.7%. Next to public biotech, our tenants with marketed products make up 14% of our ARR generated $150 billion in revenue in 2022 and include names such as Amgen, Gilead, Vertex and Moderna. Moderna continues to highlight the potential of novel platforms to deliver innovative new medicines to patients. This month, the company's personalized mRNA cancer vaccine in combination with an immunotherapy drug from Tenant Mark, demonstrated promising clinical trial results in aggressive forms of skin cancer. <br/>Companies also continue to set high bars for continued innovation and product launches. For example, Alexandria Tenant Gilead has laid out an ambitious plan to achieve 20 new drug approvals by 2030, which will entail advancement of their current pipeline, particularly in oncology, supplemented by additional M&amp;A. <br/>For our preclinical and clinical stage public biotechs comprising 10% of our ARR, compelling clinical data remains king. Tenants such as Vaxcyte and Biomea Fusion, for example, have recently raised additional capital of promising clinical data. Prometheus Biosciences, while not a tenant exemplify how data drives the lifeblood of the industry. The company announced stellar data in December, driving their stock up over 600% in the past 12 months and culminating in a $10.8 billion acquisition by Merck. <br/>To be clear, in the process of developing novel medicines, there will always be some that fail no matter what the market conditions. But this is baked into our mall. With the deep tenant base, relationships across every facet of the industry, and the highest quality space in operations, we can get ahead of potential tenant challenges to backfill and further optimize our tenant base. Reflecting this, in April, we've collected 100% rent from our preclinical and clinical stage public biotech tenants. <br/>Next, transitioning to academic and institutional tenants, which constitute 12% of our ARR, it's an opportunity to remember that the life science industry's cornerstone is innovation, which is not slowing. Bipartisan support for life science research remains strong. At $47.5 billion, the NIH's 2023 budget is a 21% increase over 2019. Academic and medical institutions continue to be highly productive, a key metric being the pace of new intellectual property. In 2021, U.S. academic institutions accounted for 20,000 invention disclosures and nearly 1,000 new startups. And this activity in return is an important long-term funding mechanism for these institutions. <br/>For example, for Prometheus Bio was originally spun out of Cedars-Sinai, which is set to receive nearly $800 million from the recently announced M&amp;A. In sum, with the majority of our academic and institutional ARR from investment-grade tenants and funding cycles that are based on multiyear grant funding time lines, this segment continues to be sheltered from larger macroeconomic conditions. <br/>Staying on the topic of innovation, a few final data points to orient the growth of the life science industry beyond the next few quarters but to the decades to come. According to the American Society of Cell and Gene Therapy, there are over 3,700 gene, cell and RNA therapies in preclinical and clinical development. For chronic diseases, which drives the bulk of healthcare spend in the United States, there are over 800 medicines in clinical development. <br/>The culmination is continued FDA approvals and 2023 has started at a fast clip. Year-to-date, 14 novel therapies have been approved including a novel therapy for ALS developed by Tenant Biogen just announced this morning. And altogether for the year, nearly 60 novel medicines have been scheduled for FDA approval review which mirrors 2018's record year of 59 novel FDA approvals. <br/>To end, I want to reiterate that we are acutely aware of the years of abundance and easy capital that have passed and that the separation of haves and have-nots will continue to widen as the industry drills down on the technologies and medicines that bring the most value to patients and investors. But as Winston Churchill once said, \"Never let a good crisis go to waste.\" While this market is and will continue to warrant extreme prudence, it is an opportunity for the best companies to hone in on their long-term fundamentals and thrive. And that's what our tenants and Alexandria exemplify. <br/>With that, I'll pass it off to Peter.",
			"<strong>Peter M. Moglia</strong>",
			"Thanks, Hallie. I just had my 25th anniversary with the company. In addition to that milestone reminding me of how fast time moves by brought about a nostalgic look back at my time at Alexandria. I recall my interview with Joel, where I learned about this novel idea of forming a real estate company to serve the life science industry, which made me both nervous, as nobody had ever done it before, and equally inspired to help enable an industry that was hell-bent on changing the world. <br/>After serious contemplation, I decided that if I was going to make it different in the world, this was a heck of an opportunity to do it plus after having been in real estate for about 8 years at that point, I could see a tremendous value in offering mission-critical facilities over commodity product. I could not have made a better decision as it all proved out. <br/>Alexandria has played a critical role in the evolution of the life science industry over the last 3 decades by creating and growing the ecosystems and clusters that ignite and accelerate the world's leading innovators in their pursuit to advanced human health, which is our solid mission. In addition, we've built an irreplicable world-class asset base of robust and highly differentiated properties and campuses that attract a diversified best-in-class tenant base who values our expertise and operational excellence by providing 75% to 85% of our leasing quarter-to-quarter. <br/>The result of all this is we have built a brand without peer that puts us in a position where we don't rely on third parties to bring us tenants. They come to us directly as we are a trusted partner with a long successful track record of developing and operating mission-critical facilities. This is an important distinction in any part of the cycle, but perhaps even more when things have slowed down.<br/>Our results prove it out. Thank you for indulging me on that retrospective. I'm going to go and briefly touch on our development pipeline, construction costs, leasing and asset sales and then hand it over to Dean. <br/>In the first quarter, we delivered 453,511 square feet in 5 projects into our high barrier to entry submarkets. Annual NOI for these deliveries totals $23 million, and the initial stabilized yield is strong at 7.3%. At quarter end, projects under construction and near-term projects expected to commence construction over the next 4 quarters totaled 7.6 million square feet and are 74% leased or under negotiation. This is very similar to last quarter, but in response to the uncertainty and volatility in the markets, we have made a strategic decision to reduce 2023 construction spend by $250 million by pausing or delaying projects that had been classified as under construction, so we can focus our capital on the most strategic projects that have the most attractive terms, enabling our highly bedded and vast tenant base. <br/>The reduction in spend results in NOI from deliveries primarily commencing from the second quarter of '23 through the first quarter of '26 to be approximately $610 million. After commenting on construction costs for the past 2 years, I can still say they remain volatile but are on their way to stabilizing. The availability and price of commodities such as steel, copper, aluminum and concrete, continue to fluctuate due to shortages of raw materials, low yields from mines, high demand from electrification or low capability utilization rates in the mills and fabrication shops due to labor shortages. <br/>Cost of materials and supply chain volatility were the initial drivers of construction inflation, but now the primary driver is labor with a triple whammy of wage increases, shortage of workers and the inefficiency of the remaining labor force due to the retirement of older, more skilled labor. <br/>There are 330,000 open construction jobs today and the time it takes to train the new entrants to be highly skilled as measured in years. So these inefficiencies will be with us for a while. Specific to life science buildings, the availability of switchgear and equipment such as HVAC units and generators has slightly improved but their lead times are still extraordinarily long with custom air handlers taking 27 weeks longer to get than before COVID and switch gear and generators and astounding 64 weeks longer. <br/>Even worse is the availability of large transformers provided by the utility companies, which can take as long as 3 years now to get. What's driving these delays are chip shortages and demand from electrification projects happening all over the world as investors, governments and end users demand improvement in carbon emissions. As you can imagine, the cost of this equipment is reflective of these shortages and paired with high labor cost is making new laboratory office projects more expensive to build than ever before. <br/>The upside for us is that 84% of our costs for our active development and redevelopment projects are under GMP or other fixed contracts with contingencies behind that. So we are largely locked in. Anyone contemplating a speculative development these days will have to contend with these delays and associated high costs, which will put the feasibility of building and financing the project at considerable risk. <br/>One reason we will likely not see the supply many are expecting beyond what is under construction today. Transitioning to leasing, our strong brand loyalty, mega campus offerings and operational excellence continue to drive strong leasing numbers in a challenging market. The 1.2 million square feet leased in the first quarter is above our 5-year pre-2021 average and is the 12th consecutive quarter with leasing volume above 1 million square feet. <br/>We achieved attractive economics primarily from our vast tenant base, accounting for 85% of the leasing this quarter, resulting in a rental rate increase of 48.3%, which was the highest in company history and a strong cash rate of 24.2%. As we have noted previously, demand has normalized from the record year of 2021. Depending on who you ask, demand is at slightly below or slightly above pre-COVID levels. There are less tenants actively seeking space in the market today, which we believe is being significantly driven by uncertainty in the economy. <br/>As Hallie put it, this market is and will continue to warrant extreme prudence. However, we're not dependent at all on broker deal flow. There are pending opportunities from our fast tenant base that the broader market likely does not see due to our direct relationships with company management teams. Such relationships are a huge differentiator for us and will continue to drive solid leasing even in tough environments. Some private and preclinical clinical stage companies are making do with the space they have today until they can better understand their ability to raise capital on its cost. <br/>Capital is available. But as Hallie mentioned, VCs are more discriminate disciplined in demanding of future investments and companies with tenured management teams, strong differentiated technologies and near-term value inflection milestones are the ones that will rise above the fray. Those are the halves who by and large are Alexandria's tenants, which we have underwritten and placed into our world-class asset base, differentiated from the have-nots tenant base of others who take on any tenant that can fill space with hope as their underwriting strategy. <br/>On the supply side, we track high-quality projects, we believe, are competitive to ours in the high barrier-to-entry submarkets. Accordingly, we're tracking direct vacancy in Greater Boston to be 2.8%. Unleased sublease space is at 3.9% and unleased supply directly competitive with our AAA locations and building quality to be 1.5% to be delivered in 2023 and 5.1% to be delivered in 2024, a 1.3% total increase in availability from last quarter. <br/>In San Francisco, direct vacancy is 3.5%, sublease space is at 5.8% and unleased supply directly competitive with our assets continues to be the highest in all of our markets at 6.6% and 8.9% to be delivered in '23 and '24, respectively. This is an increase of 3.4% in total availability over last quarter, largely driven by spec building in South San Francisco. <br/>In San Diego, direct vacancy is at 4.1%, sublease space is at 2.3% and unleased competitive supply is 3.2% in 2023 and 5.4% in 2024, a slight increase of 0.2% over last quarter. Supply in all submarkets is very likely to be muted beyond what is under construction today due to high construction costs that I referenced, higher cost of capital and the lessening of generic tenant demand. We focus primarily on high barrier-to-entry markets where supply is inheritedly limited. <br/>We focus primarily on high barrier to entry markets and brand mega-campus offerings in those AAA high-barrier-to-entry market locations and operational excellence enables us to continually mine our vast and deep tenant base to drive our leasing activity, which will likely lessen the impact of generic supply. <br/>I'll end with some commentary on our value harvesting and recycling progress. As we all know, the rapid rise in interest rates have not only increased investors' cost of capital but created a lot of uncertainty causing a number of investors to remain on the sidelines. Adding to the difficulty to execute in this environment is the increasing desperation of a number of office building owners trying to raise cash to stay afloat by offering quality long-term leased assets with credit tenants at 6.5% to 7.5% cap rates. Despite these challenges, the demand for high-quality life science assets which is vastly different from office assets continued in the quarter. <br/>As noted in our press release, we were pleased to transfer an 18% interest in our current JV at 15 Necco which we control and owned 90% prior to the sale. The asset is under construction and will not be delivered until the end of this year with cash flow commencing in mid-2024. The buyer will fund the remaining construction costs to deliver the property to our tenant until they reach a 37% ownership, which is expected to be the remainder of the cost to deliver the project. <br/>Given that the receipt of cash flow is over a year away, it's difficult to translate the valuation to an operating cap rate. But to give you some color, the parties agreed to evaluation at closing to be $576 million or $1,665 per square foot, which is an initial yield of 5.25% on their investment based on in-place NOI at closing. But we also agreed to credit our partner $5.5 million in fees payable. Because we sold 33% of the total 37% our partner purchased, those fees equate to approximately $15 million in value. Stripping that $15 million from the purchase price gets you to a total valuation of $561 million increasing the cap rate to 5.4%. If you want to tie that to the supplemental, the $66 million price for the 18% and the other -- if you add the other $119 million to be funded to completion and divide it by the 33% we sold, you get $561 million. <br/>This was a great outcome for Alexandria as we were able to partner with a world-class investor to monetize the value creation and secure the capital for the remaining spend in an accretive manner while retaining control of the asset and all management fees. We have not yet closed on the other transaction we signed an LOI on in the fourth quarter, but we expect to do so in the second quarter. In addition to this transaction, we have signed letters of intent or purchase and sale agreements for a number of assets, including the office campus referenced in the press release, aggregating to a total sales price of $799.3 million. These future transactions and 15 Necco account for approximately 57% of the progress needed to meet the midpoint of our disposition guidance. <br/>With that, I'm going to hand it over to Dean.",
			"<strong>Dean A. Shigenaga</strong>",
			"Thanks, Peter. I'm Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. We reported excellent operating and financial results that exceeded consensus with strong core results, and our team is off to a strong start towards a solid growth for 2023. Our client tenants continued very timely payment of rent year-to-date through April. We have a very strong balance sheet. We have meaningfully reduced uses of capital for 2023, made excellent progress on dispositions and sales of partial interest, have a conservative FFO payout ratio and a growing dividend and are the go-to brand for life science real estate. <br/>We have a very strong balance sheet with $5.3 billion in liquidity, no debt maturities until 2025. Our team made excellent progress on our dispositions and sales of partial interest only 4 months into 2023. As Peter highlighted, we've advanced transactions aggregating $865 million. They're either completed or subject to executed LOIs or purchase and sales agreements, including the new JV partner for our build-to-suit project for Eli Lilly. Many of the in-process transactions are targeted to close on or about June 30. Now we have also identified other dispositions and sales of partial interest to bring our total for the year to $1.5 billion. <br/>While the macro environment remains challenging, we are reasonably optimistic that we can execute on our disposition plan in 2023 at attractive values and cap rates. We will provide values and cap rates quarter-to-quarter as we close transactions since we're unable to do so sooner while transactions are in process. In addition to the $1.5 billion in dispositions and sales of partial interest, New JV capital forecasted for the full year of 2023 will contribute over $300 million towards construction spend this year, including most of the $119 million of contributions from the new partner we just added to our build-to-suit project for Eli Lilly. Now JV contributions to construction spend, including forecasted joint ventures were added to our detailed disclosures on Page 48 of our supplemental package. <br/>Now turning to outstanding financial and operating results. We had really strong growth of $342.9 million or up 13.9% in total revenues for the first quarter annualized in comparison to the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis was up $246.2 million or 15.4% really strong growth of 6.8% in FFO per share for the quarter in comparison to the first quarter of 2022, and again, off to a very strong start and on track for 6.4% growth in FFO per share for 2023. <br/>Now key highlights of our continued strong operating and financial performance. Strong growth in revenues, adjusted EBITDA and FFO per share was driven by the continued strength across key areas of our unique and differentiated business. We had continued strength and timely payment of rent from our client tenants, 99.9% and for the first quarter and 99.7% for April that was through April 21, only 3 weeks into this month, pretty amazing. Continued strength in same-property NOI growth of 3.7%, 9% on a cash basis and really reflects the benefit of strong rental rate growth on leasing in recent quarters, contractual annual escalations in rent and the burn-off of some free rent. <br/>Our strong outlook for 2023 same-property NOI growth is 3% on a GAAP basis, 5% on a cash basis and generally consistent with our strong 10-year average for same property growth. <br/>Now turning to record rental rate growth and strong leasing volume. Strong rental rate growth continued into 2023 at 48.3% on a GAAP basis, 24.2% on a cash basis from lease renewals and re-leasing the space in the first quarter. Now this was an exceptional rental rate growth, GAAP at the highest in the company's history, both GAAP and cash rental rate growth higher than the strong rental rate growth for the full year of 2022 and 2021. <br/>Now leasing volume for the first quarter was strong at 1.2 million rentable square feet, slightly ahead of the strong quarterly average of leasing volume prior to the exceptional record-level leasing volume in both 2021 and 2022. <br/>Now the key takeaway is that the scale of our high-quality tenant roster combined with operational excellence from our team, puts us in an excellent position to benefit from the unique pool of demand from our client tenants even in this unusual macro environment. <br/>Now our strong occupancy was in line with our expectations. Occupancy was 93.6% as of March 31 and really in line with expectations and the comments I provided on our year-end earnings call. There are 3 key takeaways here. First, occupancy is expected to improve in the back half of the year. Second, 371,000 rentable square feet of the recent vacancy has significant rental rate growth of 110% on a GAAP basis and 115% on a cash basis; and third, 29% of this 371,000 rentable square feet has already been leased with occupancy of some of the space beginning in the third quarter of '23. <br/>Please refer to Footnote 1 on Page 26 of our supplemental package for more information. We also absorbed $71,000 of vacancy from a building located in Texas. This is one of 2 buildings that were undergoing redevelopment last quarter, 1 building, aggregating 131,000 rentable square feet is currently 36% pre-leased and undergoing redevelopment. We decided to hold on further redevelopment of the second building, aggregating 71,000 rentable square feet until we lease up the remainder of the 131,000 rentable square foot building. The 71,000 rentable square foot building is vacant and is classified in operating properties. <br/>We continued with very strong adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. Briefly on a high-quality tenant roster, Alexandria really is the brand for life science real estate, has built long-term trusted relationships and is a true partner to the life science industry. 90% of our top 20 tenants are investment-grade rated or large-cap publicly traded companies. And we highlighted continued strength of timely payments of rent from client tenants at 99.9% of rent that was due in the first quarter really reflects the strength of our high-quality client tenants, important tenant relationships and the high-quality underwriting from our research team. <br/>Briefly on venture investments, realized gains from the venture investments included in FFO averaged about $25.8 million per quarter for the last 8 quarters through the end of 2022 in comparison to $20.7 million for the first quarter of 2023. Now we do expect realized gains each quarter from our venture investments for the remainder of '23 to be more consistent to slightly up from the historical quarterly average of $25.8 million that I just highlighted. Gross unrealized gains in our venture investments as of March 31 were $459 million on a cost basis of $1.2 billion. <br/>Now we've got continued consistency and growth in dividends from really high-quality cash flows that we generate in our business. We've got a very low and conservative FFO payout ratio, 55% for the first quarter annualized with 5.3% increases in common stock dividends over the last 12 months. We're projecting $375 million in net cash flows from operating activities after dividends for reinvestment. At this rate, this represents over $1.1 billion of capital for reinvestment over the next 3 years. <br/>Briefly on external growth, we have $610 million of incremental net operating income from our pipeline of 6.7 million square feet that is 74% leased. Approximately 30% of this NOI will commence in the remaining 3 quarters of 2023, about 40% will commence in 2024, about 26% in 2025 and the remaining 4% thereafter. <br/>Now turning to guidance. We updated our underlying guidance assumptions for 2023. These assumptions are disclosed on Page 4 of our supplemental package. Our per share outlook for 2023 was updated to plus or minus $0.05 of a range from the midpoint of guidance, down from the plus or minus $0.10 range last quarter. Our range of guidance for EPS is $2.21 and to $2.31 and our range for FFO per share diluted as adjusted is $8.91 to $9.01 with no change at the midpoint of $8.96. Now this represents a strong 6.4% growth in FFO per share for 2023 following excellent growth last year of 8.5%. <br/>Now key updates on the underlying detailed assumptions included the following: a significant reduction of $325 million in both sources and uses of capital, including a $75 million reduction in the midpoint of acquisitions to $225 million and a $250 million reduction in construction spend at $2.725 billion. We also gave updates on significant dispositions and partial interest sales aggregating $865 million including significant transactions that are under executed LOIs and purchase and sale agreements. <br/>Now rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-leasing this space was increased 1% for both GAAP and cash to a range of 28% to 33% for GAAP and 12% to 17% on cash and occupancy was adjusted 20 basis points to reflect vacancy from 170,000 rentable square foot building located in Texas that is on hold while we lease up the adjacent building under redevelopment that is currently 36% leased. Importantly, occupancy is expected to recover in the second half of 2023. <br/>With that, let me turn it back to Joel Marcus. Thank you.",
			"<strong>Joel S. Marcus</strong>",
			"So operator, can we go to questions, please?",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"(Operator Instructions) <br/>The first question today comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore.",
			"<strong>Stephen Thomas Sakwa</strong>",
			"Joe, look, I can appreciate that you still haven't closed a lot of these deals, but I think the market would certainly appreciate just any range of commentary you could provide on sort of how to think about cap rates. I realize not singling out individual deals, but is there a way to sort of bracket them or bucket them kind of against maybe where your implied cap rate is today or maybe against the deal that Peter discussed.",
			"<strong>Joel S. Marcus</strong>",
			"Well, I think the way and I'll have Peter certainly and Dan may want to comment as well. I think it's fair to think about we were posting low 4% cap rates, again, on Class A facilities over the last couple of years, and Peter just went through, I thought, a pretty clear explanation of the transaction in Greater Boston, which is essentially a 5.4%. So you might think about an adjustment of cap rates maybe over this transition, transitioning economic time of maybe 100 basis points. So that's maybe a way to frame it. But I think you'll be pretty impressed. And I think people would be impressed when we do our second quarter call. But Peter, any comments?",
			"<strong>Peter M. Moglia</strong>",
			"Yes, I agree with that assessment. I would say that we will see things that are still lower than 5% potentially when there's a good mark-to-market opportunity that can be monetized. But if it's stable, high-quality assets going to have a 5 handle on it just like this one did.",
			"<strong>Joel S. Marcus</strong>",
			"Dan, any other comment you would throw out?",
			"<strong>Daniel J. Ryan</strong>",
			"Yes. No, I think not Peter said it perfectly.",
			"<strong>Joel S. Marcus</strong>",
			"Okay. Steve, hopefully, that's helpful.",
			"<strong>Stephen Thomas Sakwa</strong>",
			"Yes. No, that's great. And then, Joel, and maybe you and Hallie could just comment. I saw that I guess in the last supplemental, you talked about sort of dealing with 1,000 tenants. This time, you kind of mentioned 850. My sense is half of that is retail tenants that maybe are leaving for an asset. But I suspect that maybe some of them are not retail. And I guess that really just speaks to how are you changing maybe your underwriting in the tenants that you're sort of willing to do business with today versus maybe tenants who were willing to do business with either post SVB or a couple of years ago?",
			"<strong>Joel S. Marcus</strong>",
			"Yes. We didn't have 150 failures. But Dean, do you want to highlight that for a moment?",
			"<strong>Dean A. Shigenaga</strong>",
			"Yes. So Steve, the huge majority of the change was really due to a simple future mega campus development project that we acquired. It's a retail project known as The Shops at Tanforan. That was almost all of the change in the tenancy from roughly 1,000 to 850. You're right. Beyond that, like we highlighted, not just during this call, but over the last couple of quarters, we've had, as you would always expect some normal lease expirations that occur at the end where the tenant doesn't choose to extend. And that's fairly normal activity. And then we've also had a few tenants that have come back, as you guys are well aware and have come back to and their lease a little bit early.<br/>But that was really a handful of leases over the last couple of quarters. I think the big takeaway though is, look, you know that we do a really good job at selecting really high-quality locations in the core of the life science cluster markets. So great locations, great facilities. And I think our operational excellence and our brand puts us in a great position to capture mark-to-market on most of these spaces that have come back.<br/>I mean the comments I provided on the vacancies that came up just in the first quarter alone with mark-to-market, both GAAP and cash north of 100%. And 29% of that space has already been leased. If you go back to my comments in the fourth quarter, I believe I gave similar comments of pre-leasing on space that had just rolled as well. So we've got good activity. And again, going back to the crux of your question, Steve, almost all that change in the tenancy was retail related at that shopping mall.",
			"<strong>Joel S. Marcus</strong>",
			"Yes. And let me maybe put a footnote on that, Steve. You asked about the nature of underwriting. I think kind of Hallie said it all that when we look at private companies or we look at preclinical public companies or even companies in the clinic that are public. So that group of tenants, you're always looking now even much more so for much nearer-term value inflection milestones and really good data and importantly, large unmet medical needs. I mean we've always done that, but I think now it just goes to show that they're going to be the haves and the others that have-nots. So that's really, I think, where the mindset is.",
			"<strong>Stephen Thomas Sakwa</strong>",
			"Great. And just one last question, Dean, do you have like an overall mark-to-market on kind of what you think the portfolio kind of lost the leases on the overall assets today?",
			"<strong>Dean A. Shigenaga</strong>",
			"Meaning if we were to mark-to-market the rental rate, Steve, on the whole portfolio?",
			"<strong>Stephen Thomas Sakwa</strong>",
			"Yes.",
			"<strong>Dean A. Shigenaga</strong>",
			"Yes, it's somewhere around -- I think last quarter, it was somewhere around 27%. This quarter, it's closer to 22% overall in the whole portfolio.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan.",
			"<strong>Anthony Paolone</strong>",
			"You guys talked about driving a lot of your leasing from just internal relationships in your existing tenant base. And so I was wondering if -- I don't know if there's an Alexandria dashboard, so to speak, or what, but can you maybe give us a sense as to what either like leasing traffic, rate or just the aggregate amount of demand that's coming out of your portfolio today looks like versus, say, now 2, 3, 4 quarters ago?",
			"<strong>Joel S. Marcus</strong>",
			"Yes. That is almost -- that's hard to do generally, and it's so submarket and building specific, Tony. Clearly, demand is overall down from the peak of '20 and '21. You see that just everywhere, and you certainly see it on more of a normalization of our historical leasing, which has bounced around over the last either 5-year benchmark or 10-year. But maybe the thing to say is companies that are active are pharma, and I think Peter alluded to this, bigger biotech product and service companies that aren't so much focused on the manufacturing side or the supply side. And then clearly, biotechs that whether they be public or private that have got good data coming. I think that's where you see it, but I'm not sure we could give you a numerical characterization of that.",
			"<strong>Anthony Paolone</strong>",
			"I guess maybe a different way to ask it is if you think about the next couple of years, you see where the growth is within your portfolio, and you also know space that's coming due in your development pipeline, do you see enough demand today to absorb the space that's coming online in the next couple of years? Or do you think we should expect some moderation in occupancy levels as the demand is lower?",
			"<strong>Joel S. Marcus</strong>",
			"Well, yes, I'll let maybe Peter comment on that as well. But I think it's fair to say if you look at our pipeline, which is pretty highly leased, I think we have a reasonably high level of confidence that we can fully lease those projects. And there are demand that doesn't even show up today on projects that may be on the future drawing board that we're also comfortable with. I don't think we see demand dropping off a cliff here at all. But Peter, you want to comment and Dan, you could comment as well.",
			"<strong>Peter M. Moglia</strong>",
			"Yes. The -- there's been a slowdown in activity due to the fact that boards and companies are really just trying to figure out where the economy is heading. There's definitely expansion needs. They're just not going forward with some of them, which is contributing to the reduction in demand. So I would say that there's a nice amount of pent-up demand building. And I would say a couple of years from now that, that's definitely going to be in the market if not sooner.",
			"<strong>Anthony Paolone</strong>",
			"Okay. And then just one second question, maybe a bit of detail. In the supplemental package on Page 34, you break out the portfolio between the operating assets and the various buckets of future opportunities. I guess what I'm trying to just make sure if I'm putting a cap rate on ARE's NOI and getting a value, what from that slide do I need to add to that to kind of capture the totality. So I'm just trying to understand if in some of these future opportunities buckets, if there's some operating assets in those? Or I'm just trying to piece that all together, so either we're capturing everything or not double-counting something?",
			"<strong>Dean A. Shigenaga</strong>",
			"Tony, it's Dean here. So you're referring to the Page 34 for others on the call, which is in the bottom right-hand corner. This page highlights square footage of our operating, but most importantly, the different categories of our pipeline, everything from construction to the future. There's no significant cash flows from assets that are sitting in the pipeline. I just want to make clear that there's a line item that adjusts the future pipeline for square footage that's sitting in operations, but those cash flows are in the operating portfolio of, Tony, as you pick up that NOI to value the company.<br/>We just don't want you to double count the square footage as you go towards the future pipeline. But from an NOI perspective, if that's your fundamental question, the future pipeline doesn't have any significant NOI being generated at the moment.",
			"<strong>Anthony Paolone</strong>",
			"So like that 4.2 million square feet, there's not an appreciable amount of NOI from that, that we would be picking up...",
			"<strong>Dean A. Shigenaga</strong>",
			"Well, wait a second, the 4.2 million is in rental properties today. It's in operations, Tony. I thought you were asking about the 38 million right above it, 37.889 million.",
			"<strong>Anthony Paolone</strong>",
			"Right. So the 4.2 million, does have some meaningful NOI associated with it. That's that we'd be...",
			"<strong>Dean A. Shigenaga</strong>",
			"Correct. So you don't want to double count the square footage there.<br/>That's why we net down the square footage in that disclosure to 30 -- roughly 34 million.",
			"<strong>Anthony Paolone</strong>",
			"Right, right. But the book value has that 4.2 million in there.",
			"<strong>Dean A. Shigenaga</strong>",
			"The book value would only have it to the extent it's not related to the operating component, Tony. It's in operations, the book value would be sitting in the operating component. If a larger campus had 2 operating buildings and a pad to support 2 buildings, the pad to support the future buildings would be in the future pipeline, the book basis. but the cost base is related to the operating buildings would be in operations, not in the pipeline.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi.",
			"<strong>Nicholas Gregory Joseph</strong>",
			"Maybe just on the sources and uses. Obviously, there's dispositions and partial interest sales that are continuing to come at different points in the cycle right now. But as you think about the ability to flex that going forward, if the transaction market stalls even more, how are you thinking about the flexibility on your end? And where could equity play into that?",
			"<strong>Joel S. Marcus</strong>",
			"Yes. So Dean?",
			"<strong>Dean A. Shigenaga</strong>",
			"Well, I don't know that -- I mean, it's interesting the way you posed the question. Maybe I'll start from the back end of your question. Flexing our capital plan and turning to equity as a solution is not really something we are contemplating. I think the way to look at our capital plan is what we are doing internally, like we did in the current quarter for earnings as well as over the last several quarters and prep for initial guidance for Investor Day this year was to really challenge the uses of capital. <br/>I think one thing to keep in mind is that -- our pipeline is $610 million of incremental net operating income from projects that are highly leased today. There's so much equity type capital that's invested in CIP today, there's very little incremental equity needed to fund that pipeline. And so we're looking at spend across other projects as we look forward over into '24 and beyond to be sure we're prioritizing things that we should be investing into and maybe holding on things that we shouldn't be just given the macro environment. <br/>So Hopefully, that gives you just some color on how we're thinking more broadly about it. I think, as I mentioned on the call earlier, we're mindful of the macro environment. We're also in a position where we know where we are here at the end of April with a lot of good activity on the pipeline.<br/>And so we're reasonably comfortable with our outlook into 2023 and we'll obviously provide an update as we go quarter-to-quarter, but a bulk of what we have under executed LOI or PSA agreements today is sliding to close here fairly soon, plus or minus mid-year. So we feel good about it, and we'll keep an eye on things as we go through the next 2 quarters.",
			"<strong>Nicholas Gregory Joseph</strong>",
			"Absolutely. That's helpful. And then maybe just on that kind of reduction in development spend. How does that play into capitalized interest and interest expense in 2023?",
			"<strong>Dean A. Shigenaga</strong>",
			"Yes. Well, it's all reflected in our guidance. We just gave it. So you saw there was no changes in capped interest down in the details, obviously, if you -- we did on a number of projects review strategically what we wanted to do and a number of them were put on temporary hold, if you want to look at it from that perspective. Redevelopments were placed into operations as vacant assets, development projects for the future were -- they have been paused on a few circumstances, which basically were left in the future development pipeline.<br/>From a capitalization perspective, that operating building that went in -- I'm sorry, the redevelopment building that's vacant that went into operations capitalization ceased immediately. The other projects have activities that are winding down as we speak, meaning capitalization will cease over the next month to a number of months going forward.<br/>But they're all basically shutting down in the near term in the scheme of things, they're relatively small. So we've been able to absorb that. It sits within our range of guidance. It sits within our range of FFO with other assumptions offsetting those changes.<br/>So we are able to pick up some improvement to offset those. So hopefully, that gives you a sense. I mean we look at qualifying activities carefully across all of our projects that are undergoing construction activities and capped interest and shut them down accordingly. So you will see some of that, but they're fairly small in the scheme effects.",
			"<strong>Nicholas Gregory Joseph</strong>",
			"That's helpful. And then just on the transaction market, I know you touched on cap rates, maybe up about 100 basis points in each asset, very different, though. Is there anything you're seeing from a buyer or kind of bidder pool buyer pools kind of change relative to what you've seen really over the last 12 months, just given kind of where financing costs have moved different institutions either fallen out? Or have you seen kind of any institutional interest that you haven't seen before?",
			"<strong>Peter M. Moglia</strong>",
			"Yes. It's Peter. I'll take that. We actually have a number of choices still in the market. But there are definitely some folks that are on the sidelines that are facing redemptions. And so they're interested in accumulating more life science product, but they can't necessarily play right now. But that's been filled in by some other new folks coming in that want exposure that are also high-quality institutional investors. And -- so we have liquidity, and I'm not too concerned about that at this point. I think it will get better once there's more certainty in where the terminal rate is going to land and where cost of capital is so people get comfortable in spending their allocations for '23.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.",
			"<strong>Michael Albert Carroll</strong>",
			"Peter, can you talk a little bit about the supply comments that you're making in your prepared remarks? I mean are you seeing developers being more cautious pursuing new projects? I know there's a few data sources out there saying that developers are still pursuing life science projects specifically in Boston, I mean, would you agree with that statement?",
			"<strong>Peter M. Moglia</strong>",
			"Yes. Certainly, there are -- there have been -- there has been spec building, especially in Boston. What we are seeing is in areas outside of our core submarkets where we don't own product, there are vacant buildings sitting there. And it's -- we're hearing that there's no tours, there's no activity. So we don't necessarily think that those buildings are competitive to ours. There are a few projects, obviously, that we do believe, and that's where those percentages are coming in. <br/>So obviously, '23, a lot of stuff has already been delivered. There's some more coming in '24, there's more coming. We are seeing very little that is starting new today. I think there was one project in South San Francisco that has started recently, which is just beyond comprehension. But outside of that, we believe that anything that would compete in -- of our quality is in our numbers and that we don't think many, if any, people will start new projects from here on out, at least not in a material manner, but who knows?",
			"<strong>Michael Albert Carroll</strong>",
			"Okay. Great. And then just last, on 15 Necco, what's the reason for selling that specific, I guess, development stake? Is there any something about that building that you didn't like or that was more particularly attractive to certain investors, I guess, why that property?",
			"<strong>Peter M. Moglia</strong>",
			"Well, it was a fairly low yield. So we're giving away not too much upside by selling part of it, right? And are the investors that we attracted really like the building, and it was an opportunity to fund something that was in near-term dollars. So it made a lot of sense.",
			"<strong>Joel S. Marcus</strong>",
			"Yes. And I mean it's a world-class building with a world-class tenant. So it certainly is one of those opportunities that would attract a variety of capital sources. And we continue to be the dominant owner as well. So it's kind of meets all the requirements that we have for monetization.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Rich Anderson with SMBC.",
			"<strong>Richard Charles Anderson</strong>",
			"So on the 7.6 million square foot pipeline, how much -- what does that imply in terms of development spend in 2024? And how much of that is potentially some place where you can sort of tap the brakes like you kind of did this quarter in deference to the current capital raising market, please?",
			"<strong>Dean A. Shigenaga</strong>",
			"Rich, it's Dean Shigenaga here. So you said 7.6 million...",
			"<strong>Richard Charles Anderson</strong>",
			"You use any pipeline place you want. I'm curious as to what you've committed to in terms of development spending.",
			"<strong>Dean A. Shigenaga</strong>",
			"I see what number you're referring to. So you were referring to the pipeline that's under construction, 5.5 million square feet, plus another 1.2 million near term. Those are all 100% pre-leased projects. So that ties to the $610 million for others of incremental net operating income. We haven't broken out that number for '24 to spend just related to that, but that's not -- within that bucket now we've slimmed down the focus of what is continuing to generate the $610 million of NOI. <br/>And for the most part, Rich, for the most part, those are either 100% leased projects or multi-tenant projects, most of which have some level of pre-leasing. Some that don't have pre-leasing today are multi-tenant projects anywhere from a building to multiple buildings. So rightsized for delivery to requirements in the market, they're not lumpy, large build-to-suit opportunities that could be more specific to larger requirements.<br/>So I guess, a long way of saying, Rich, I think we feel comfortable with what we've rightsized for the pipeline of activity. The construction spend, plus or minus will play out like a normal curve for spend over that pipeline, roughly 2 years from the start of new projects, the active pipelines part way through that already. So what you're really focused on, though, in your question is a spend outside of that, which goes to quite a bit of activity, site work, advancing site work as well as entitlements. <br/>Entitlements are important. They add a lot of value. Site work shrinks the time to deliver buildings to a tenant, which if you looked at us 2 years ago, we said, let's move that along. If you look at us today, we'd say, well, let's think carefully about site work given cost of capital considerations with the macro environment today, and let's just hold on that until the right time.<br/>And so I think we're going to look hard, as I mentioned earlier, over the next couple of quarters. We continue to refine our plan for 2024 because as I mentioned earlier, the $610 million of pipe -- that pipeline does not require much more equity capital at stabilization because we have so much already in CIP, the incremental EBITDA will allow us to debt fund leverage neutral, the wide majority of the incremental capital for that pipeline. So it's more general TIs and renovation costs that aren't part of development and redevelopment that we need to scrutinize in our business.",
			"<strong>Joel S. Marcus</strong>",
			"Yes. And that's kind of the critical message.",
			"<strong>Richard Charles Anderson</strong>",
			"Yes. Got it. And then the second question for me is on the success that you're having from asset sales and partial interest. It's obviously the best way to -- one of the best ways to raise equity capital right now for you guys today. But at what point does it become too much? Where you're parting ways with your preeminent assets, you only want to do that to a certain degree before you're giving away stuff you'd rather own 100%. So is there a sort of a number you can point to that this is how much we can raise from a disposition standpoint, still be in a range where we're comfortable with our ownership position in these fantastic assets longer term.",
			"<strong>Dean A. Shigenaga</strong>",
			"Rich, it's Dean here. I think the way to think about at a high level is that we just closed the conversation about the pipeline 6.7 million square feet under construction or including 1.2 million to start in the near term here. That's a lot of product. And we just completed a lot of product over the last 2 or 3 years. So we have added a lot of high-quality assets to our portfolio in recent years as well as coming online here over the next 2 to 3 years. So putting it off a piece of the portfolio makes sense. And we're mindful of your question, but we have so much coming online and that we have completed in recent years. I think we feel we're in pretty good shape.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Tom Catherwood with BTIG.",
			"<strong>William Thomas Catherwood</strong>",
			"Just following up on Michael's previous question about Boston. Can you provide some more insight on the decision not to redevelop 275 Grove Street? And is there any read-through to other recent acquisitions in Greater Boston like GateHouse Drive or Presidential Way?",
			"<strong>Joel S. Marcus</strong>",
			"Yes. I think Peter can comment as well. I think the way we're trying to think about it is to -- I mean we have a very significant position in the greater Boston market, 14 million, 15 million square feet. And I think in a tougher macro environment, it's kind of a thought to prune and rightsize. You see what we've done last year would be a good example of, we sold a set of really good high-quality workhorse assets, but we felt in locations that were not necessarily high barrier to entry markets, but good economics for buyers as well and good economics for us. And I think as we think about different assets, we're trying to make sure that we're more focused on the highest barrier to entry markets rather than less. And I think that's probably the best example I could maybe share. Peter, but you could give your color.",
			"<strong>Peter M. Moglia</strong>",
			"Yes. I mean there was one nuance to kind of focus us on 275 Grove, which was when we acquired that, there was a thought an opportunity to expand our holdings in that neighborhood and in fact, adjacent to it. So we in addition to high-barrier to enter, we also really are focused on aggregating into mega emphasis and the opportunity to do that wasn't attractive enough for us to move forward. And so we ended up with this kind of stand-alone asset, which is a really good office asset. But you have to start prioritizing and that one just kind of lost some of the shine when the opportunity to expand kind of went away.",
			"<strong>William Thomas Catherwood</strong>",
			"Got it. And then Peter, sticking with you, I appreciated your comments on availability rates when including 2023 and '24 deliveries. When it comes to upcoming lease expirations, you're typically in conversations with tenants a year or multiple years in advance. Are you getting any sense that tenants are engaging less on their '24 expirations or space needs given the large amount of expected deliveries between now and the end of '24?",
			"<strong>Peter M. Moglia</strong>",
			"That's a hard question to answer because it's pretty -- would be pretty granular for me to understand when I'm looking at leasing reports remembering what is expiring today versus in the future. But I believe our early renewal statistics have been fairly strong recently. So I guess the short answer is I don't -- I haven't noticed anything. We are constantly in communication with the regions about their upcoming renewals in a year to 2 years, even 3 years ahead at times, our -- what's the status of the company and are they expanding? And do we want in the portfolio or not? And so we're pretty aware. And if I think -- if there was some weakness there, I think I would have probably noticed it by now.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.",
			"<strong>Joshua Dennerlein</strong>",
			"I just wanted to follow up on some of those supply comments, particularly the San Francisco supply. It sounds like that's where the biggest incremental change was when you're looking at 2023 and 2024 unleased new supply. What in particular kind of changed on that front, new supply coming online? Or was it projects that were previously signed and then kind of the lease went away?",
			"<strong>Peter M. Moglia</strong>",
			"Just some new recent starts and one large one in particular in South San Francisco, you made up most of that change. It is just uncanny that people are still trying to put new products into the queue in a market that has a lot of vacancy. We're fortunate we have one project moving that is kind of a good niche for earlier-stage companies, mid-stage companies, so we don't have to go on an elephant hunt to lease some really large project, but there's a lot of folks out there that are going to be in a lot of trouble because of what I would think is fairly reckless investing.",
			"<strong>Joel S. Marcus</strong>",
			"Well, and also, historically, if you go back to my comments, I said we have tried to shape the company and allocate our capital as much as possible the high barrier to entry markets and mega campuses. South San Francisco, we've never had a dominant position. We chose not to win the Britannia assets came for sale quite a number of years ago and in those days, HCP bought that, I think, almost $3 billion, we valued at about $1.7 billion. So we decided to pass on that. <br/>But what's changed in South San Francisco is transportation is now a bit of an issue. Genentech transitioned to Roche which is a great company, a world-class company, but they're not company creating in that market like Genentech was like a factory for spin-outs much like MIT is. And some of those aspects of what would otherwise be a high barrier to entry market don't exist there. So you saw some of the moves we made last year in South San Francisco, exiting a number of assets, passing on -- we passed on an option we had to do a development. And so we're being pretty darn cautious there, and you'll see that continue.",
			"<strong>Joshua Dennerlein</strong>",
			"And then one other question. I saw you revised upward the leasing spread guidance. What was that a function of just market rent growth or just lease that you actually started in 1Q?",
			"<strong>Dean A. Shigenaga</strong>",
			"It's reflective of where we usually start at the beginning of the year. If you look back over time, I think we've enjoyed the opportunity to move rental rate growth and same-property performance northward as we make our way through the year. And so a combination of settling in on activity this quarter, as well as our continued outlook for the remainder of the year. So slight improvement overall.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Next question comes from Dylan Burzinski with Green Street.",
			"<strong>Dylan Robert Burzinski</strong>",
			"And I appreciate the color that you guys have provided thus far on sort of demand and the normalization on that front. But just curious, from a geographic perspective, are there certain markets or submarkets where the normalization is a little bit more onerous?",
			"<strong>Joel S. Marcus</strong>",
			"Well, I think maybe South San Francisco might be not so much for us but maybe others. Yes, that's a good example. And we've tried to minimize or limit our exposure there and transaction that we did on a build-to-suit was really a bit -- it's in the South San Francisco submarket, but it's a little bit out of there. But directly on transportation, we felt was a huge competitive advantage and landed a world-class tenant to 100% occupy that development. So I think that's one example, yes.",
			"<strong>Dylan Robert Burzinski</strong>",
			"And I guess just on that line of thought, like our markets like in the non-cluster markets, like RTP, suburban Maryland, are those sort of seeing similar kind of normalization demand trends as San Francisco versus maybe like your core mark submarkets like Cambridge, UTC Torrey Pines of San Diego?",
			"<strong>Joel S. Marcus</strong>",
			"Yes. I think we're still seeing decent activity maybe RTP or RT, I should say, has slowed maybe a bit more than we would have guessed. But part of that's due to my guess is the mix of tenants down there in the -- not so much our tenants per se, but the mix of life science, the components of life science tenants in that market.<br/>And I think we see in Maryland still pretty good. It's slower than it has been because obviously, '20 and '21 were peak times and obviously COVID dollars we're heavily focused on that market, but we're still seeing pretty decent activity that I would say, matches our historical numbers. So that's just 2 examples.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The next question comes from Georgi Dinkov with Mizuho.",
			"<strong>Georgi Damyanov Dinkov</strong>",
			"Could you please provide more color on the internal leasing pipeline that comes from your existing tenants? And how that demand compares to the broader industry?",
			"<strong>Joel S. Marcus</strong>",
			"I don't think you can compare that because no one has the scale and depth of the tenant base that we do, and we know pretty instantaneously about the needs of those tenants versus if you're just in the market using brokers and you're kind of hearing hearsay, or secondhand. So the 2 are pretty fundamentally different.",
			"<strong>Georgi Damyanov Dinkov</strong>",
			"Understood. And apologies if I missed it, but do you have any lease termination fees this quarter? And if so, how much?",
			"<strong>Joel S. Marcus</strong>",
			"Dean?",
			"<strong>Dean A. Shigenaga</strong>",
			"Yes, nothing significant in the quarter.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"Next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo.",
			"<strong>James Colin Feldman</strong>",
			"Can you talk about the credit watch list today and just what that looks like as a percentage of your revenue versus, say, 6 months ago, how that number has changed?",
			"<strong>Joel S. Marcus</strong>",
			"Yes. I don't know that -- I mean, we don't call it a credit watch list. I think Hallie indicated, we have a pretty methodical deep and judicious approach that has always been there. And I mean, if you looked at, say, the Rubia situation, we would say that if there's a management change that then you look at -- or you put that scrutiny at a higher level when it happens. And then as technology developments or lack thereof, take hold that you are informed about. And rumor sometimes when you're dealing with public companies, you have to -- sometimes we have confidentiality agreements, sometimes we don't. So information comes in different ways in different fashions. <br/>We just have a more -- much more hands-on work approach with clients. But I think the bottom line is the simple bottom line. If you look at -- Hallie indicated, if you look at the tenant collections by segment, they're 99% to 100%. So we've, I think, done an extraordinary job of managing rent collections and monitoring all of our tenants in a way that I don't think anyone else could even imagine. So I don't know if that's a helpful way to characterize it, Jamie.",
			"<strong>James Colin Feldman</strong>",
			"No, that is helpful. I mean, I guess the big picture is like everyone kind of sees the headlines on what's going on in life science. Clearly, you are flying above the clouds or just have a better portfolio, a better tenant base, but it's so hard to handicap just how bad this cycle could get for you..",
			"<strong>Joel S. Marcus</strong>",
			"I think if you look -- yes, I mean if you look at the tenant base and where we, again, Hallie, went through each of the segment or a number of the segments, and I think you could always say to me, the privates are in pretty good shape because they're not exposed to the public markets, and they generally assuming we've underwritten them well, and we have. They generally have good and deep backers, whether it's venture or institutional. And then you look at public, which are preclinical or in the clinic, but don't have near-term milestones. I think that's the area that everybody is really focused on, and we have very limited exposure there.<br/>I mean, for example, we turned down a lease with Sorrento Therapeutics down in San Diego some years ago because we -- it was kind of like Elizabeth well, Theranos, forget her last name, but Elizabeth Holmes. I know people who did diligence and they said they could never look at the Edison machine. Well, if you can't look at the Edison and how it works and so forth, you can't underwrite the tenant. Well, that's kind of how we looked at Sorrento. We couldn't understand the science, not that we had some ability to say, hey, this is going to fail or not fail, but we simply could not understand the science that we passed on the tenancy. And that's just how we do things.",
			"<strong>James Colin Feldman</strong>",
			"Okay. No, that's helpful. And then I guess, Dean, just back to your comment on the $25.8 million of gains you might show. I mean what's the maximum you think you could do on that number -- on that line item?",
			"<strong>Dean A. Shigenaga</strong>",
			"Well, I mean, a couple of years back now, I think it was 2 years ago, Jamie, we took -- the market was able to deliver on some unique liquidity events within the portfolio, and we had something just north of $200 million in realized gains. Now our policy has been these large significant unusual items, they're one-off, there aren't events that we control. And those, as you go back, about $100 million of that was excluded from FFO per share. These were individually very significant gains. <br/>But that's just one example as a historical data point, Jamie, is -- but if you look back for now, I think this would be the third year that we're into this run rate right at about $100 million, $105 million on average, I think, for the last couple of years. And that's kind of the general outlook other than having a slightly lower number for the first quarter.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joel Marcus for any closing remarks.",
			"<strong>Joel S. Marcus</strong>",
			"Just simply, thank you very much, and we look forward to talking to you on second quarter call.",
			"<strong>Operator</strong>",
			"The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

			"American Tower (AMT) came out with quarterly funds from operations (FFO) of $2.54 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.38 per share. This compares to FFO of $2.55 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.",
			"This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 6.72%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this wireless communications infrastructure company would post FFO of $2.23 per share when it actually produced FFO of $2.34, delivering a surprise of 4.93%.",
			"Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates three times.",
			"American Tower , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry, posted revenues of $2.77 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.88%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.66 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.",
			"The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.",
			"American Tower shares have lost about 4.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.1%.",
			"<b>What's Next for American Tower?</b>",
			"While American Tower has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?",
			"There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.",
			"Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.",
			"Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for American Tower: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.",
			"It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $2.42 on $2.77 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $9.65 on $11.05 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.",
			"Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, REIT and Equity Trust - Other is currently in the top 44% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.",

			"<strong>Weyerhaeuser Company</strong> WY is slated to report first-quarter 2023 results on Apr 27, after the closing bell.<br/><br/>In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings had surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 33.3% but net sales missed the same by 3.2%. Quarterly adjusted earnings and net sales for the quarter, however, decreased 51% and 17.4%, respectively.<br/><br/>Weyerhaeuser’s earnings beat the consensus mark in all the last four quarters, with the average surprise being 13.7%.",
			"The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings has decreased to 15 cents from 17 cents per share over the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a decrease of 88.6% from the year-ago level. The consensus mark for revenues is $1.90 billion, suggesting a 39.1% year-over-year decline.",
			"Weyerhaeuser Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Weyerhaeuser Company Quote",
			"Slow construction activities are expected to weigh on Weyerhaeuser’s first-quarter 2023 results. Precisely, a slow housing market and weakness in the Wood Products segment will depress the company’s quarterly results on a year-over-year basis. Overall, lower lumber and OSB prices are expected to have weighed on Weyerhaeuser’s first-quarter 2023 performance despite operational excellence improvements and disciplined capital allocation moves of the company.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, transportation and resin shortages have been a headwind for the Wood business. Higher raw material costs for OSB web stock, resin and veneer may have also been a pressing concern.<br/><br/>WY expects earnings (before special items) and adjusted EBITDA in the Timberland segment to be slightly higher sequentially for the first quarter. In the West, the company expects fee harvest volumes to be significantly high from the fourth quarter of 2022. Domestic sales realizations are expected to be significantly low owing to lower demand. Per-unit log and haul costs are expected to be moderately lower sequentially. Fee harvest volumes, forestry and road costs and sales realizations in the South and North are expected to be slightly lower.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in the Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment, Weyerhaeuser expects earnings to be $10 million, higher sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA is likely to be $35 million higher than fourth-quarter 2022, thanks to the timing and mix of sales.<br/><br/>Within the Wood Products segment, the company projects earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be moderately high sequentially (excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board).<br/><br/><strong>Other Projections</strong><br/><br/>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Wood Products segment (contributing approximately 78% to revenues) revenues is pegged at $1,441 million, implying a decrease from $2,519 million in the year-ago period but an improvement from $1,331 million in the fourth quarter.<br/><br/>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Timberland segment (contributing approximately 26% to revenues) revenues is pegged at $529 million, implying a decrease from $626 million in the year-ago period and $548 million in the fourth quarter.<br/><br/>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment revenues is pegged at $97 million, implying a decline from $128 million a year ago but an increase from $55 million in the prior quarter.",
			"Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Weyerhaeuser this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br/><br/>Currently, WY has an Earnings ESP of -22.30% and a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).",
			"Here are some other companies in the Zacks Construction sector, which according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat on their respective quarters to be reported.<br/><br/><strong>Trex Company, Inc. </strong> TREX has an Earnings ESP of +11.34% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see <strong>the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br/><br/>Shares of Trex Company have declined 5.9% in the past year. TREX’s earnings beat the estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 7.2%.<br/><br/><strong>United Rentals, Inc. </strong>URI has an Earnings ESP of +4.51% and a Zacks Rank #3.<br/><br/>Shares of United Rentals have increased 22% in the past year. URI’s earnings beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 6.9%.<br/><br/><strong>Owens Corning</strong> OC has an Earnings ESP of +3.18% and a Zacks Rank #3.<br/><br/>Shares of Owens Corning have increased 11.5% in the past year. OC’s earnings beat the consensus mark in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 12.9%.<br/><br/>Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.",

			"<b>About American Tower<br/></b>American Tower, one of the largest global REITs, is a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate with a portfolio of nearly 226,000 communications sites and a highly interconnected footprint of U.S. data center facilities. For more information about American Tower, please visit the \"Earnings Materials\" and \"Investor Presentations\" sections of our investor relations website at <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:www.americantower.com;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.americantower.com&amp;esheet=53388043&amp;newsitemid=20230426005386&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.americantower.com&amp;index=3&amp;md5=3e8f9148b5533dbab0006772d616931c\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">www.americantower.com</a>.",
			"<b><span>Non-GAAP and Defined Financial Measures</span></b>",
			"In addition to the results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) provided throughout this press release, the Company has presented the following Non-GAAP and Defined Financial Measures: Gross Margin, Operating Profit, Operating Profit Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Nareit Funds From Operations (FFO) attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, Consolidated Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO), AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders per Share, Free Cash Flow, Net Debt and Net Leverage Ratio. In addition, the Company presents: Tenant Billings, Tenant Billings Growth, Organic Tenant Billings Growth and New Site Tenant Billings Growth.",
			"These measures are not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Rather, they are presented as additional information because management believes they are useful indicators of the current financial performance of the Company's core businesses and are commonly used across its industry peer group. As outlined in detail below, the Company believes that these measures can assist in comparing company performance on a consistent basis irrespective of depreciation and amortization or capital structure, while also providing valuable incremental insight into the underlying operating trends of its business.",
			"Depreciation and amortization can vary significantly among companies depending on accounting methods, particularly where acquisitions or non-operating factors, including historical cost basis, are involved. The Company's Non-GAAP and Defined Financial Measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.",
			"<b><span>Revenue Components</span></b>",
			"In addition to reporting total revenue, the Company believes that providing transparency around the components of its revenue provides investors with insight into the indicators of the underlying demand for, and operating performance of, its real estate portfolio. Accordingly, the Company has provided disclosure of the following revenue components: (i) Tenant Billings, (ii) New Site Tenant Billings; (iii) Organic Tenant Billings; (iv) International pass-through revenue; (v) Straight-line revenue; (vi) Pre-paid amortization revenue; (vii) Foreign currency exchange impact; and (viii) Other revenue.",
			"<b>Tenant Billings:</b> The majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from non-cancellable, long-term tenant leases. Revenue from Tenant Billings reflects several key aspects of the Company’s real estate business: (i) \"colocations/amendments\" reflects new tenant leases for space on existing sites and amendments to existing leases to add additional tenant equipment; (ii) \"escalations\" reflects contractual increases in billing rates, which are typically tied to fixed percentages or a variable percentage based on a consumer price index; (iii) \"cancellations\" reflects the impact of tenant lease terminations or non-renewals or, in limited circumstances, when the lease rates on existing leases are reduced; and (iv) \"new sites\" reflects the impact of new property construction and acquisitions.",
			"<b>New Site Tenant Billings:</b> Day-one Tenant Billings associated with sites that have been built or acquired since the beginning of the prior-year period. Incremental colocations/amendments, escalations or cancellations that occur on these sites after the date of their addition to our portfolio are not included in New Site Tenant Billings. The Company believes providing New Site Tenant Billings enhances an investor’s ability to analyze the Company’s existing real estate portfolio growth as well as its development program growth, as the Company’s construction and acquisition activities can drive variability in growth rates from period to period.",
			"<b>Organic Tenant Billings:</b> Tenant Billings on sites that the Company has owned since the beginning of the prior-year period, as well as Tenant Billings activity on new sites that occurred after the date of their addition to the Company’s portfolio.",
			"<b>International pass-through revenue:</b> A portion of the Company’s pass-through revenue is based on power and fuel expense reimbursements and therefore subject to fluctuations in fuel prices. As a result, revenue growth rates may fluctuate depending on the market price for fuel in any given period, which is not representative of the Company’s real estate business and its economic exposure to power and fuel costs. Furthermore, this expense reimbursement mitigates the economic impact associated with fluctuations in operating expenses, such as power and fuel costs and land rents in certain of the Company’s markets. As a result, the Company believes that it is appropriate to provide insight into the impact of pass-through revenue on certain revenue growth rates.",
			"<b>Straight-line revenue: </b>Under GAAP, the Company recognizes revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract for certain of its tenant leases. Due to the Company’s significant base of non-cancellable, long-term tenant leases, this can result in significant fluctuations in growth rates upon tenant lease signings and renewals (typically increases), when amounts billed or received upfront upon these events are initially deferred. These signings and renewals are only a portion of the Company’s underlying business growth and can distort the underlying performance of our Tenant Billings Growth. As a result, the Company believes that it is appropriate to provide insight into the impact of straight-line revenue on certain growth rates in revenue and select other measures.",
			"<b>Pre-paid amortization revenue: </b>The Company recovers a portion of the costs it incurs for the redevelopment and development of its properties from its tenants. These upfront payments are then amortized over the initial term of the corresponding tenant lease. Given this amortization is not necessarily directly representative of underlying leasing activity on its real estate portfolio (i.e. does not have a renewal option or escalation as our tenant leases do), the Company believes that it is appropriate to provide insight into the impact of pre-paid amortization revenue on certain revenue growth rates to provide transparency into the underlying performance of our real estate business.",
			"<b>Foreign currency exchange impact: </b>The majority of the Company’s international revenue and operating expenses are denominated in each country’s local currency. As a result, foreign currency fluctuations may distort the underlying performance of our real estate business from period to period, depending on the movement of foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar. The Company believes it is appropriate to quantify the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on its reported growth to provide transparency into the underlying performance of its real estate business.",
			"<b>Other revenue: </b>Other revenue represents revenue not captured by the above listed items and can include items such as customer settlements, fiber solutions revenue and data centers revenue.",
			"<b><span>Non-GAAP and Defined Financial Measure Definitions</span></b>",
			"<b>Tenant Billings Growth:</b> The increase or decrease resulting from a comparison of Tenant Billings for a current period with Tenant Billings for the corresponding prior-year period, in each case adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the growth in recurring Tenant Billings and underlying demand for its real estate portfolio.",
			"<b>Organic Tenant Billings Growth:</b> The portion of Tenant Billings Growth attributable to Organic Tenant Billings. The Company believes that organic growth is a useful measure of its ability to add tenancy and incremental revenue to its assets for the reported period, which enables investors and analysts to gain additional insight into the relative attractiveness, and therefore the value, of the Company’s property assets.",
			"<b>New Site Tenant Billings Growth:</b> The portion of Tenant Billings Growth attributable to New Site Tenant Billings. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the growth attributable to Tenant Billings from recently acquired or constructed properties.",
			"<b>Gross Margin:</b> Revenues less operating expenses, excluding depreciation, amortization and accretion, selling, general, administrative and development expense and other operating expenses. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the site-level profitability of its assets.",
			"<b>Operating Profit: </b>Gross Margin less selling, general, administrative and development expense, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the site-level profitability of its assets while also taking into account the overhead expenses required to manage each of its operating segments.",
			"<b>Operating Profit Margin:</b> The percentage that results from dividing Operating Profit by revenue.",
			"<b>Adjusted EBITDA:</b> Net income before income (loss) from equity method investments, income tax benefit (provision), other income (expense), gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, interest expense, interest income, other operating income (expense), depreciation, amortization and accretion and stock-based compensation expense. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the profitability of its operations while at the same time taking into account the central overhead expenses required to manage its global operations. In addition, it is a widely used performance measure across the telecommunications real estate sector.",
			"<b>Adjusted EBITDA Margin:</b> The percentage that results from dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue.",
			"<b>Nareit Funds From Operations (FFO), as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (Nareit), attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders: </b>Net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion less dividends to noncontrolling interests, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling interests. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the operating performance of its property assets by excluding the charges described above, particularly depreciation expenses, given the high initial, up-front capital intensity of the Company’s operating model. In addition, it is a widely used performance measure across the telecommunications real estate sector.",
			"<b>Consolidated Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO):</b> Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders before (i) straight-line revenue and expense, (ii) stock-based compensation expense, (iii) the deferred portion of income tax and other income tax adjustments, (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges, (vi) other income (expense), (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, (viii) other operating income (expense), and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interests, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures. The Company believes this measure provides valuable insight into the operating performance of its property assets by further adjusting the Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders metric to exclude the factors outlined above, which if unadjusted, may cause material fluctuations in Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders growth from period to period that would not be representative of the underlying performance of the Company’s property assets in those periods. In addition, it is a widely used performance measure across the telecommunications real estate sector.",
			"<b>Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders: </b>Consolidated AFFO, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders and the other line items included in the calculation of Consolidated AFFO. The Company believes that providing this additional metric enhances transparency, given the minority interests in its Europe business and its U.S. data center business.",
			"<b>AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders per Share:</b> AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.",
			"<b>Free Cash Flow:</b> Cash provided by operating activities less total cash capital expenditures, including payments on finance leases and perpetual land easements. The Company believes that Free Cash Flow is useful to investors as the basis for comparing our performance and coverage ratios with other companies in its industry, although this measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies.",
			"<b>Net Debt: </b>Total long-term debt, including current portion and finance lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents.",
			"<b>Net Leverage Ratio:</b> Net Debt divided by the quarter’s annualized Adjusted EBITDA (the quarter’s Adjusted EBITDA multiplied by four). The Company believes that including this calculation is important for investors and analysts given it is a critical component underlying its credit agency ratings.",
			"<b><span>Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements</span></b>",
			"This press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" concerning our goals, beliefs, expectations, strategies, objectives, plans, future operating results and underlying assumptions and other statements that are not necessarily based on historical facts.

			"Dividends accounted for nearly 40% of the annualized total return of the broad market from January 1926 through March 2023, including both capital appreciation and dividends reinvested. Dividend-paying securities can be attractive to investors during recessionary periods and are seen as more stable and financially secure than companies that do not pay dividends.

			"Regular income is often a primary concern for retirees, as they no longer have the same level of steady income from employment that they had during their working years. But not only retirees, any investor who is seeking regular income from their investments may consider dividend stocks as part of their investment strategy. Moreover, concerns about high-interest rates and growing inflation have pushed investors into dividend-paying stocks this year.

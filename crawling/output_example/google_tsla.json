Together, the group owns $1.5 billion in Tesla shares, less than 1% of the company‚Äôs total value.\n\nTesla rebounds slightly from 2022 losses\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk has been busy lately\n\nMusk currently takes no salary for his role as CEO of Tesla after cashing out his stock options from a 2018 package earlier this year, fueling speculation that the EV company isn‚Äôt at the top of his list of priorities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the past week alone, Musk launched a rocket, accused Microsoft of illegally using Twitter data, slashed the prices for two Tesla models, and announced the development of his own AI chatbot. He still seemingly had enough time to take away blue checks from celebrities on Twitter, before giving them back when his plan backfired.\n\nThis all happened during a week that Tesla reported dwindling quarterly earnings, including a 24% plunge in net income. The company also reported that‚Äîdespite boosting car deliveries by more than a third‚Äîits operating margin had fallen from 19.2% last year to 11.4% now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the earnings call, Musk said he‚Äôs focused on his grand vision for Tesla, not on creating profit, telling investors that the company is the only one ‚Äúmaking cars that technically could sell for zero profits now and yield tremendous profits in future through autonomy.‚Äù\n\nThis strategy falls in line with his recent grandiose plans to turn Twitter into the app for everything and bypass philosophers to create an epistemic AI chatbot that focuses on ‚Äúmaximum truth-seeking.‚Äù It isn‚Äôt difficult to imagine why investors are concerned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated stories:\n\nüá∫üá∏ Tesla slashed prices for a sixth time this year to alleviate the loss of Biden‚Äôs EV tax credits\n\nAdvertisement\n\nüîå BYD profit surged by 400% last year as the electric vehicle market keeps going in China\n\n\n\nüöó Tesla is the latest American manufacturer to invest in Mexico",

Other challenges cited include various lawsuits and regulatory probes facing Tesla, along with accusations of poor labor practices.\n\nAs a result, investors are urging Tesla‚Äôs board to rein Musk in. This could include enacting a policy that limits his \"outside commitments or a CEO succession plan.‚Äù\n\nHowever, Amalgamated Bank tells(Opens in a new window) CNN it isn‚Äôt necessarily calling for Musk‚Äôs ouster.

Shares in GM are down more than 20% from their 2023 peak in February, and are trading close to their 2010 IPO price of $33 a share. Ford shares are down 13% since February as Tesla CEO Elon Musk has escalated a strategy of squeezing his company's profit margins to expand sales volume.\n\nGM reports first-quarter results on Wednesday. This month, the automaker signaled an upbeat outlook with its first quarter U.S. sales report, titled \"Off to a Great Start.\" GM's first-quarter U.S. sales rose 18% from a year ago, with sales of high-margin trucks and SUVs leading the way.\n\nAt the same time, GM CEO Mary Barra is accelerating a drive to cut operating costs by $2 billion by year end. Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson told investors this month that 5,000 GM employees people had accepted severance deals.\n\nSo far, GM has been slow to ramp up in production of its newest EVs, with just 968 Cadillac Lyriq EVs delivered in the first quarter. In the near term, that could help the company dodge the impact of Tesla's price cuts, J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a note Monday.\n\n\"GM and Ford should see drastically better trends in pricing and resulting margin impacts than did Tesla\" in the first quarter, Brinkman wrote. However, he added, investors are concerned that \"weakness in EV pricing could spread beyond Tesla to other automakers‚Äô electric vehicles and ‚Äî much more importantly ‚Äî into the broader market for new vehicles generally.\"\n\nFord, which reports first-quarter results on May 2, also reported strong first-quarter truck sales in the U.S. - with deliveries of F-150 pickup trucks jumping 21% from year ago levels, depressed by semiconductor shortages.\n\nThe first-quarter report will be the debut for Ford's new financial reporting approach, reflecting its broader restructuring.\n\nThe company will report results for its Model e electric vehicle business, Ford Blue combustion vehicle operations and Ford Pro commercial vehicle unit. In a briefing last month, Ford signaled its EV unit could lose $3 billion before taxes this year.\n\nReporting By Joe White; Editing by David Gregorio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

In France, the list price of the Tesla Model 3 now starts at the same level as the Renault M√©gane electric, around 42,000 euros ($46,318).\n\nThough Renault's CEO, Luca de Meo, acknowledged at a presentation that Tesla remains a \"challenge in the short term,\" he said his company will not engage in a price war on electric vehicles.\n\n\"We don't want to do what we did in the past, we want to sell our cars, we don't want to give away our cars,\" Renault's head of engineering, Gilles Le Borgne, said to journalists and analysts at the same event.\n\nA \"software-defined vehicle\" design will be at the heart of Renault's future electric-vehicle entity, \"Ampere,\" the French automaker said. Developed with Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), it will considerably reduce complexity by allowing to have just 20 processors on board to run a car instead of the currently required one hundred.\n\nThis will also allow for updates to be made remotely without touching the hardware.\n\n\"This is similar with Tesla, in 2026 they are going to have the same approach, they have the same EV architecture approach,\" said Renault's chief digital officer, Fr√©d√©ric Vincent.\n\n\"In 2026, we will be at the level of Tesla\" in software defined vehicles,\" le Borgne added.\n\nBy making constant updates of driving and infotainment features possible, the architecture should improve the resale value of the cars, supporting the pricing power of the company, and avoid 1.5 billion euros of Research & Development (R&D) expenses in a decade.\n\nThe total cost balance should nevertheless be neutral after taking into account the investment required for the new architecture and the price of the more advanced processors put aboard, Le Borgne said.\n\nThe \"Flexevan\" electric van program for last-mile delivery will inaugurate Renault's new architecture around mid-2026, followed by the sporty Alpine brand and then by all models of the Renault brand.\n\n($1 = 0.9068 euro)\n\nReporting by Gilles Guillaume in Paris Writing by Victor Goury-Laffont Editing by Matthew Lewis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

		"body": "Tesla has begun producing in Shanghai a version of the Model Y to be sold in Canada this year, the first time it will ship cars to North America from China, according to a person with direct knowledge of the plan and a production memo seen by Reuters.\n\nThe move would connect Tesla's (TSLA.O) biggest and most cost-efficient factory in the world to North America, its largest market. The Model Y is the electric vehicle (EV) maker's best-selling model globally.\n\nOver the weekend, Tesla posted on its website that it would offer a new, cheaper version of its Model Y in Canada, a rear-wheel drive variant of the SUV-styled crossover priced C$10,000 ($7,377.90) lower than the long-range version of the vehicle available in that market.\n\nTesla's website showed that customers in Canada could take delivery of the new version of the Model Y between May and July.\n\nThe Canadian government's website was updated on Friday to show that the new version of the Model Y and the more expensive long-range variant both qualify for incentives of C$5,000 on the purchase or a four-year lease.\n\nTesla Shanghai began production of the Canada-bound version of Model Y earlier this month, a person with knowledge of the development said. The production memo reviewed by Reuters showed that vehicles had been designed and tested for export to North America, with a target of producing nearly 9,000 this quarter.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nReuters reported in November that Tesla had considered plans for exporting made-in-China vehicles to North America. After the Reuters report was published, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, in a Twitter post, had said \"False,\" without elaborating.\n\nMusk told analysts last week that Tesla's Shanghai plant had the \"lowest cost structure\" of any of its factories.\n\nSUBSIDIES\n\nCanada's transport agency's EV incentive program mandates that a base model for an SUV has to be under C$60,000 to qualify for a subsidy of up to C$5,000. Higher cost variants are then also eligible at a price of up to C$70,000.\n\nThe introduction of the cheaper Model Y for Canada qualified both it and Tesla's C$69,900 long-range Model Y for the incentive as of Friday, Transport Canada said on its website.\n\nTesla‚Äôs Shanghai plant uses lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries for the Model Y version produced there for sale in China and for export to Europe and other markets.\n\nAt its factories in Texas and California, Tesla has been rolling out a more powerful battery configuration known as 4680.\n\nTesla‚Äôs website shows the new, Canada-specific version of the Model Y has an EPA-rated range equivalent to 245 miles (394 km) on a charge. The US version of the entry-level Model Y, which has all-wheel drive, has an EPA-rated range of 279 miles.\n\nThe new Model Y for Canada is also cheaper than the entry-level US model - $44,275 versus the current price of $46,990 for the US.\n\nTesla has cut U.S. prices on Model Y variants three times since the start of the year, part of a discounting strategy to drive volume that sliced into its first quarter margin and touched off a price war on EVs.\n\nIt shipped more than 271,000 Model Y and Model 3 sedans from its Shanghai factory last year to Europe and other markets, roughly a fifth of its global sales.\n\nTesla is not alone in exporting EVs from China. Renault (RENA.PA) exports the Spring, an entry-level hatchback EV to Europe under its Dacia brand. BMW (BMWG.DE) exports the iX3 from China to Southeast Asia and Europe.\n\nChina‚Äôs overall car exports grew four-fold between 2020 and 2022 to top two million vehicles and are on track to top three million this year if the first-quarter pace is sustained.",

		"body": "A single deal with Elon Musk's Tesla Inc. propelled a little-known family to a staggering $1.2 billion fortune.\n\nDon‚Äôt Miss: The House-Printing Robot Shaking Up a $7.28 Trillion Industry\n\nL&F Co. Ltd., a South Korean company that produces high-nickel cathodes for electric vehicle batteries, received a $2.9 billion order from the electric car maker, causing its share price to soar 82% in the past year. As a result, the listed holdings of Hur Jae-hong and his family, the owners of L&F, have surged to over $800 million, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires index.\n\nFor years, the U.S.-based electric vehicle manufacturing giant has been using L&F's cathodes through batteries procured from LG Energy Solution Ltd. But this is the first time that Tesla has become a direct client of L&F.\n\nWooho Rho, an analyst with Meritz Securities Co. in Seoul, notes that L&F seems poised for further growth.\n\n\"The company‚Äôs direction is centered on technology and production efficiency, so it seems to have good DNA,\" Rho said. \"The fact that its latest client is not just any other but the one that‚Äôs leading the market carries even greater significance.\"\n\nSee More: A Healthier Alternative to Coffee & Energy Drinks: Pureboost Gives You Energy Without The Burnout and Exhaustion\n\nThe Hur family's roots in business go back to Hur's great-grandfather, Huh Man-jung, who cofounded LG in 1947. The conglomerate has been producing everything from consumer electronics to home appliances and batteries for electric vehicles. The family incorporated energy-to-construction giant GS Group in 2004, while L&F was established in 1968.\n\nThe Hur family's wealth has been primarily derived from the LG Group for several decades, but the latest deal with Tesla provides a major source of revenue for L&F.\n\nThis recent surge in the value of companies that provide components or materials used in electric vehicle production has brought great wealth to their owners, much like the case of L&F stocks. For example, Ryu Kwang-ji, chairman of chemical manufacturer Kumyang Co. Ltd., now has a stake worth about $1.4 billion because of the company's surge in value. Another example is EcoPro Co., a battery material producer that has increased its value by about 500%, raising Lee Dong-chae and his family's holdings to $3.1 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo stay updated with top startup news and investments, sign up for Benzinga‚Äôs Startup Investing & Equity Crowdfunding Newsletter\n\nAccording to a research report by Shinyoung Securities Co. analyst Jin-soo Park, L&F is expected to reduce its dependence on LG Energy Solution for revenue to 50% by 2025. The report also suggests that unidentified manufacturers, most likely including Tesla, will contribute to 30% of the company's sales. Park views this diversification strategy positively, indicating that it could be beneficial for L&F in the long run.\n\nWhile these multi-billion dollar companies, like Tesla, are often at the forefront of mainstream media. The smaller companies landing massive deals to get them where they are can often be overlooked. For example, billion-dollar organizations like Intel Corporation and Lockheed Martin Corp. have all partnered with data-compaction startup AtomBeam, which claims to increase bandwidth by up to 4x. And SAAB and the United States Airforce are actively using the technology.\n\nThese companies helping build the Tesla‚Äôs and Intel‚Äôs of the world are the ones silently able to rake in billions. And the investors able to find these hidden gems, in some instances, make off well in stocks many have never heard of.\n\nSee more on startup investing from Benzinga.\n\nDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

China is developing and producing compelling EVs and reaping the sales as a result. (Eight of the top 10 best-selling EV models in China are from Chinese automakers.)\n\nAnd unlike the U.S. market, these are not just premium and luxury brands that only a slice of society can afford. BYD, the Warren Buffet-backed Chinese automaker, unveiled its Seagull EV during the show and the unassuming vehicle attracted some of the largest crowds at the show. Industry watchers believe that this vehicle , which starts at 78,000 yuan ($11,300), is poised to become the top-selling EV in the country.\n\nChina is already the world‚Äôs biggest market for EVs. But as the Financial Times noted in its coverage of the auto show, China is also set to push Japan out of the top spot for global car export volume this year after overtaking Germany in 2022.\n\nThis development creates a two-fold challenge for foreign automakers. After years of dominating the premium and luxury market in China, foreign brands Buick, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and others are facing homegrown competition. And now that China is exporting its vehicles to Europe, these same automakers are facing pressure in their own territory as well.\n\nTo be clear, I don‚Äôt expect Chinese brands to make a big play for the U.S. market just yet.

Much like a mobile phone getting a couple of nifty new features, the ability for manufacturers to add new elements to your car‚Äôs ownership experience is one not many people will complain about ‚Äî provided it‚Äôs free of course. However, just because your car can be updated with new features doesn‚Äôt mean that certain elements can‚Äôt be removed, either.\n\nFor Tesla owners, many may not have noticed that the ability to adjust the regenerative braking intensity quietly departed the settings screens some time ago. Regenerative braking enables electric and hybrid cars to harness the energy that would otherwise have been lost in deceleration.

But now, thanks to the latest update which is currently being pushed out to owners, the option has returned.\n\nElectrek reports that the option is found under Controls > Pedals & Steering > Regenerative Braking. It offers two toggles: Standard and low. With the standard regen, the regen is at its strongest, with the car slowing down as soon as the gas pedal is released. The car will coast further in low mode, more like a conventional ICE vehicle.\n\n‚Ä¢ Standard: Provides the maximum amount of regenerative braking.

When you release the accelerator pedal, your vehicle will take longer to slow down and coast farther than if set to ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù.\n\nadvertisement scroll to continue\n\nWhile the low regen mode is less efficient, it could assist some drivers who are making the switch from ICE to EV for the first time. There‚Äôs also an argument to be made that a lower regen strength is better for those driving in inclement weather. Either way, it‚Äôs a neat feature that has been added back.",

		"title": "Tesla in highest quarterly energy storage deployments since ...",
		"body": "Tesla Megapack BESS units at a project in the UK for clean energy developer-investor Tag Energy. Image: TagEnergy.\n\nTesla has recorded its highest energy storage deployments to date in the first quarter of 2023, enabled by the ramp up of its Megapack factory in Lathrop, California.\n\nThe electric vehicle (EV) and energy technology company reported its quarterly financial results last week. Energy storage deployments were 3,889MWh for Q1 2023, a 360% year-on-year growth from Q1 2022‚Äôs 846MWh.\n\nTesla earned just under US$1.4 billion from its energy generation and storage division in the three-month period. While the company doesn‚Äôt break out those figures between its solar PV and stationary battery storage activities, it only achieved 67MW of PV deployments in the quarter, indicating the major role energy storage plays in Tesla‚Äôs energy business.\n\nIn context, the company earned just under US$20 billion during the quarter in automotive revenues. However, in an earnings call to explain results, CEO Elon Musk said once again that stationary storage has the potential to grow to be even bigger than EVs, certainly in megawatt-hour terms of batteries, if not in dollars.\n\nTesla is ‚Äúmaking great progress‚Äù with regards to Megapack, its large-scale battery energy storage system (BESS) solution, the CEO said.\n\n‚ÄúThis is, by far, the strongest quarter ever. And this growth was achieved thanks to the ongoing ramp at our ‚ÄòMegafactory‚Äô in Lathrop, California.‚Äù\n\nThe factory still has ‚Äúsome way to go‚Äù before it reaches its targeted annual Megapack production capacity of 40GWh at Lathrop, Musk said. As reported by Energy-Storage.news, Tesla also recently announced it will construct a Megapack factory of identical size in Shanghai, China.\n\n‚ÄúAs we‚Äôve expected, the stationary storage growth actually will significantly exceed the vehicle growth.‚Äù\n\nIn January, Tesla reported 6.5GWh of energy storage deployments for the full year in 2022, a 64% year-on-year growth. In 2017, the first full year for which storage deployments were recorded, Tesla had shifted just 358MWh of stationary BESS. For the last couple of years, Musk and other executives have said demand for stationary storage is growing faster than Tesla can ramp up to meet it.\n\nCFO Zachary Kirkhorn said the stationary storage business is starting to take shape ‚Äúafter many years of investment and focus,‚Äù which began in 2015 with the launch of Tesla‚Äôs Powerwall for residential systems and the Powerpack, which was for larger commercial and industrial (C&I) systems and later joined by Megapack.\n\n‚ÄúThis business is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company‚Äôs revenue and reached its highest level yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for our Megapack products. We are also making progress on storage profitability, generating our highest gross profit yet in the quarter,‚Äù Kirkhorn said.\n\nCompany to offer ‚Äòformal guidance‚Äô on energy business\n\nAn analyst on the earnings call asked the Tesla executives when the company would start providing ‚Äúmore formal guidance‚Äù on Megapack and the overall Tesla Energy offerings, and whether Musk stood by earlier assertions of the BESS division growing to be bigger than Tesla‚Äôs automotive business.\n\nThe CEO replied that ‚Äúit‚Äôs possible automotive revenue may be higher, but gigawatt-hours I think will be probably higher with stationary storage,‚Äù noting that for the world to make its successful transition to sustainable energy, the need for stationary storage is fundamentally much greater than the need for mobile energy storage in cars and trucks.\n\nKirkhorn said Tesla will ‚Äúget to the point where we, as a company, provide guidance on the storage business,‚Äù referring to that business as being a combination of Powerwall and Megapack deployments.\n\nHowever, at this point, storage revenues are still a fairly small relative contribution, and is a business that currently contains a lot of volatility, ‚Äúboth in terms of volumes as well as financials just given the small volumes and diversification of the customer pool there‚Äù.\n\n‚ÄúBut as this business grows and smooths out, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre that far away from it,‚Äù the CFO said.\n\n‚ÄúI think including these volumes on our day two production and deliveries release is something that we‚Äôll start doing and then we can talk more formally as a business about our expectations over the coming year. I think it will be a few more quarters before we get there.‚Äù\n\nConference call transcript by Seeking Alpha.",

Notably, Tesla‚Äôs revenue in China in Q1 amounted to $4.891 billion with a year-on-year growth rate of 5.18%.\n\nAccording to the documents, Tesla‚Äôs primary market is still the United States. In Q1, its sales revenue in the US increased by 28.77% year-on-year and reached $11.247 billion. The Chinese market accounted for 20.97% of global revenue in Q1, slightly lower than its share of 22.27% for the full year of 2022.\n\nAt the start of this year, Tesla initiated a worldwide price reduction that had an impact on its profit margin. Nonetheless, CEO Elon Musk stressed during the earnings call that their focus is on sales volume rather than profit. He believes that prioritizing higher sales and larger fleet retention is more beneficial than lower sales and increased profits. It‚Äôs anticipated that Tesla will manufacture 2 million vehicles by 2023.\n\nTesla‚Äôs latest delivery data reveals that it sold 422,900 electric vehicles in the first quarter, marking a 4% increase from the previous quarter and a year-on-year surge of 36%. Meanwhile, according to figures from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA), Tesla‚Äôs total sales volume in China for Q1 was 229,300 units ‚Äì up by 21% compared to last year.

		"title": "Elon Musk Is Sending These Stocks Higher (and Tesla Isn't One of ...",
		"body": "Electric vehicles have been all the rage lately, and investors are looking to cash in on the trend away from internal combustion-powered cars and trucks. Elon Musk has been a huge proponent of EV adoption, and the boom in shares of Tesla (TSLA -1.53%) over the past decade stands as a testament to his appeal as an advocate for the transition in the auto industry.\n\nMusk recently made a simple statement that carried a lot of weight. Indeed, what Musk said was so powerful that it lifted shares of several stocks on Monday morning. Tesla stock actually opened lower, but the gains elsewhere showed that there's more than one way for investors to profit from the ongoing shift toward EVs.\n\nCharge!\n\nThe rather innocuous comment that Musk made was a simple plea to potential suppliers for Tesla. He explained in the quarterly conference call following the electric vehicle pioneer's latest financial report that Tesla was working to build out its lithium refinery operations in Corpus Christi and a cathode refinery outside Austin. Yet Musk doesn't really want Tesla concentrating on those areas. As he noted: \"We're begging you. We don't want to do it. Can someone please? Like, instead of making a picture-sharing app, please -- try in lithium, mining and refining.\"\n\nShares of lithium stocks were the big beneficiaries of Musk's latest comments. Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM 6.13%) had the largest gains Monday morning, climbing 6% in the first half-hour of trading on the day. Albemarle (ALB 5.88%) also showed significant gains, rising nearly 5%.\n\nStocks elsewhere in the sector posted slightly smaller increases but still did well. Livent (LTHM 6.05%) was up more than 3%, and Piedmont Lithium (PLL 6.62%) also managed to climb nearly 3%. Lithium Americas (LAC 7.25%) also gained ground.\n\nMultiple bottlenecks\n\nClearly, for the entire auto industry to move toward electrification, there will need to be a lot more vehicle batteries available. Based on current technology, that will require abundant lithium resources.\n\nWhere the potential crimps in the supply chain will occur, however, depends on who you ask. In Musk's view, raw lithium is relatively common worldwide. As a result, the Tesla CEO called on entrepreneurs to focus their efforts on building out refining capacity to put that lithium into a form that his company and fellow EV automakers can use for producing batteries.\n\nOthers believe that mining capacity is really the key ingredient for long-term EV success. At this point, major automakers like Ford Motor (F 2.96%) and General Motors (GM 2.21%) are working hard to ramp up battery production in order to ensure they can make enough EVs to compete against Tesla and other earlier-movers in the industry. Even if there were enough refining facilities available to meet that demand, some lithium miners just don't think that the current level of development is adequate to provide battery-grade material to everyone who wants it right now.\n\nHow lithium miners can add value\n\nThe way that lithium mining companies respond to current demand will tell a lot about the future for the industry. For instance, Albemarle has done a great job of pulling lithium out of the ground, but it also wants to convert its own production material into battery-grade lithium. It's also spending money on research and development initiatives with an eye toward looking for advances in lithium battery technology and other areas.\n\nIn the end, lithium will be a commodity, and it will be subject to the ups and downs of supply and demand. For those companies that take full advantage of the current opportunity, however, there's more potential beyond simply providing a raw material. It will be interesting to see how Albemarle and others choose to seek to move forward with future investment in the space.",

		"title": "2023 Kia EV6 vs. 2023 Tesla Model 3 Comparison",
		"body": "\n\n\n\nThe best-selling electric vehicle (EV) in America is a Tesla (the Model Y). The second best-selling EV in America is also a Tesla (the Model 3). But that‚Äôs true largely because Tesla got a head start. Today, other automakers are routinely bringing out exciting, compelling EVs that might make better choices for many buyers.\n\nOne of the most interesting is the Kia EV6. If you‚Äôve seen one in traffic, you‚Äôve probably stared. It‚Äôs a gorgeous vehicle with exceptional performance numbers. Let‚Äôs see how it compares to the Model 3.\n\n2023 Kia EV6\n\nThe 2023 Kia EV6 may be the best-looking EV in the world. It looks muscular and torsional, with an aggressive design language Kia calls ‚Äúdigital tiger.‚Äù It offers up to 310 miles of driving range and several power configurations. The most extreme of them ‚Äì the EV6 GT ‚Äì boasts 576 horsepower and truly shocking acceleration numbers. Pricing starts at $48,700, while a GT runs $61,600.\n\nKia EV6 Highlights\n\nStunning design inside and out: Tesla‚Äôs designs have evolved and changed little since the 2012 introduction of the Model S. They‚Äôve begun to look dated. The EV6, on the other hand, looks gorgeous and aggressive. It commands attention like no other EV. It‚Äôs beautiful inside as well, with a pair of screens mounted together to look like one immense curved screen.\n\n10-year powertrain warranty: EVs are a new technology. It‚Äôs reasonable to be nervous about long-term ownership costs. Kia provides the longest warranty in the business. A 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty brings a lot of peace of mind.\n\nFewer questions: Tesla changes its designs on the fly all the time, so a Tesla you buy in March, and a Tesla you buy in August may have different components. The company doesn‚Äôt publish some common information like horsepower figures, so you don‚Äôt always know what you‚Äôre getting. And its network of service centers is thin and widespread ‚Äì you might be left towing your Tesla a long distance for repairs if something goes wrong. Kia, on the other hand, is an open book and has dealerships in all 50 states capable of dealing with any problems that come up with an EV6.\n\nCheck this week‚Äôs Fair Purchase Price or see the Kia EV6 models for sale near you.\n\n2023 Tesla Model 3\n\nThe Tesla Model 3 is the second best-selling EV in America and the least expensive way to get access to Tesla‚Äôs extensive charging network. Its sedan form factor is almost rare today, as most automakers have been releasing electric SUVs. Tesla has been on a price-cutting spree early in 2023. The Model 3 now starts at $39,990.\n\nTesla Model 3 Highlights\n\nThe Tesla Supercharger network: Many EV owners love their cars but hate charging them in public. You‚Äôll probably do most of your charging at home. But if you will be charging in public, it‚Äôs worth noting that the Tesla Supercharger network is America‚Äôs most extensive charging network. Tesla opens a small percentage of those chargers to users of other brands‚Äô cars. But they‚Äôre all open to Model 3 owners.\n\nLess expensive, and sometimes much less expensive: With Tesla‚Äôs recent price cuts, the least-expensive Model 3 now costs under $40,000. The base Model 3 also qualifies for a $3,750 federal tax rebate not available on the EV6. The most expensive, the Model 3 performance, starts at $52,990. It qualifies for a $7,500 discount. With the tax rebate taken into account, that means the top trim level of the Model 3 costs less than the base EV6 for many buyers.\n\nThat Tesla prestige: Tesla is an utterly unique automaker. Other automakers have consumers who buy their cars after careful cross-shopping (like you‚Äôre doing now). But Kelley Blue Book data show that many Tesla buyers never even consider another car. If you‚Äôve always wanted the high-tech Tesla image, the Model 3 is the cheapest way to get it.\n\nCheck this week‚Äôs Fair Purchase Price or see the Tesla Model 3 models for sale near you.\n\nSimilarities\n\nThe EV6 and Model 3 are both available as comfortable commuters or high-performance cars.\n\nConclusion\n\nEither the Kia EV6 or the Tesla Model 3 could be a great EV for you. If you have uncertain access to home charging or could be traveling through areas without great EV infrastructure, the Tesla Supercharger network might make the Model 3 the right call. Its current price is attractive, too. But, speaking of attractive, there‚Äôs no doubt you‚Äôd like looking at your EV6. If you spring for the GT, you‚Äôll enjoy driving it more, too (especially that 3.5-second 0-60 mph time).\n\nOnly your own priorities can tell you which of those descriptions works for you.\n\nSpecs",

This guide aims to help you navigate the different Tesla models to determine which one suits your needs best.\n\nTOP Tesla electric cars in 2023:\n\nTesla Model 3 (2022): The cheapest Tesla\n\nFirst up is the Tesla Model 3 Rear-wheel Drive. This is the cheapest Tesla currently available and is perfect for those who are looking for an affordable electric car. It has a sleek design that is both modern and stylish, and it offers excellent performance. However, it is important to note that this model only comes with rear-wheel drive, which may not be suitable for some drivers.\n\nSince its release in 2019, the Tesla Model 3 has been the go-to electric compact sedan, a fact that is validated by its impressive sales figures. In 2021, it was even the top-selling electric car in several countries, thanks to the great price/performance ratio offered by the entry-level version: the Tesla Model 3 Propulsion.\n\nBoasting a 60 kWh battery and a range of around 500 kilometers in the WLTP cycle, the Tesla Model 3 Propulsion has numerous advantages that make it an ideal household vehicle. It‚Äôs not just about range, as the car‚Äôs performance is equally impressive, with a 0 to 100 km/h acceleration of 6.1 seconds and a sporty driving feel.\n\nHowever, for those seeking even greater autonomy (exceeding 600 kilometers) and significantly better performance (0 to 100 km/h in 4.4 or 3.3 seconds), there are two other versions of the Tesla Model 3 available that we will cover in the upcoming subsections.\n\nWith these versions, the company has truly provided drivers with even more impressive performance levels and extended range, making them an excellent choice for those who demand the very best from their vehicles.

The Tesla Superchargers network allows for worry-free long-distance travel.\n\nThe Model Y addresses the Model 3‚Äôs lack of storage space with its 854-liter rear trunk and a large tailgate opening. It‚Äôs easy to pack for a family trip without any hassle. The entry-level model has a range of over 500 kilometers and can go from 0 to 100 km/h in just 5 seconds.\n\nFor those seeking more power, there‚Äôs the Performance version.

You can also use the Tesla mobile app to manage your vehicle on the go.\n\nBut don‚Äôt think that Model Y is just for the show. This vehicle is a true sports car, with lightning-fast acceleration and a top speed of 250 km/h. During test drives, the Model Y performed admirably, with an impressive range of around 410 kilometers. And thanks to the handy journey planner, you can easily map out your route and ensure that you reach your destination with ease.\n\nOf course, all this performance comes at a price. The Tesla Model Y Performance costs a lot more than other models, but if you want all the bells and whistles, you‚Äôll need to be prepared to pay a bit more. Still, for families looking for a spacious, high-tech, and high-performing vehicle, the Model Y is tough to beat.\n\nDimensions (LxWxH) : 4751mm x 2129mm x 1624mm\n\n: 4751mm x 2129mm x 1624mm Trunk : 854 liters at the rear and 117 liters at the front\n\n: 854 liters at the rear and 117 liters at the front Battery capacity : 78 kWh\n\n: 78 kWh WLTP range: 514 to 565 kilometers\n\nTesla Model S Plaid (2022): The luxury sedan\n\nFor those who are looking for a luxury sedan, the Tesla Model S Plaid (2022) is a perfect choice.

Also, it has a range of up to 520 miles on a single charge, making it perfect for long-distance travel.\n\nThe new Tesla Model S has recently arrived in Europe after being announced with great fanfare at the end of 2020. It offers a high level of services and excellent performance, as is always the case with Tesla.\n\nThe Tesla Model S comes in its most upmarket version, known as Plaid, which is designed to offer the best in terms of performance. It can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h in 2.1 seconds with a top speed of 322 km/h. But the Model S has not forgotten the comfort of its occupants. The front seats are heated and ventilated, and the soundproofing is at the level of the best. The suspensions are also controlled to provide one of the best onboard tranquillities on the market.\n\nTesla has also introduced a new ‚ÄúYoke‚Äù format steering wheel on the Model S, replacing the traditional round steering wheel. It may take some time to get used to this new driving instrument, but Tesla seems confident that customers will prefer this format.\n\nOverall, the new Tesla Model S is a luxurious and high-performance electric sedan that offers both comfort and cutting-edge technology. With its impressive acceleration and top speed, Tesla continues to push the boundaries of what is possible with electric cars.\n\nDimensions (LxWxH) : 5021mm x 1987mm x 1431mm\n\n: 5021mm x 1987mm x 1431mm Trunk : 709 Liters at the rear and 89 Liters at the front\n\n: 709 Liters at the rear and 89 Liters at the front Battery capacity : 100 kWh\n\n: 100 kWh Range WLTP: 637 kilometers (estimated)\n\nBonus: Tesla Model X (2021): The big SUV\n\nFinally, for those who are looking for a big SUV, the Tesla Model X (2021) is a perfect choice.

It is the most significant model from the manufacturer, combining all the qualities of the Tesla Model S in terms of comfort, with even more space on board. The car is available in 5, 6, or 7-seater versions, making it perfect for families looking for a high level of comfort.\n\nWhile the front interior of the Tesla Model X is similar to that of the Model S, the feeling of space on board is very different, thanks to a windshield that extends to the rear of the front passengers. For the passengers in the second and third row, there is a screen available between the two front seats that allows them to control the air conditioning, heated seats, and infotainment system.\n\nTesla wanted to make a statement with the Model X, and it delivers both impressive performance (more than 1,000 horsepower) and a host of innovative features (such as the rear butterfly doors and motorized closure for the front doors).

		"body": "Tesla announced the 4680 battery cell back in 2020 during the company's Battery Day event. The EV manufacturer claimed that the new battery pack will come as more affordable than the existing 2170 battery pack, while the energy density and efficiency too will be increased. The automaker claimed that the cost of the 4680 battery pack would be down by 50 per cent compared to the 2170 format cell. Tesla has already started using this battery pack occasionally in some Model Y cars, and full-fledged use will commence with the Cybertruck, which is about to enter production soon.\n\nSince announcing the new battery pack three years ago, Tesla has been trying hard to increase the production number for the new type of battery cell, and it got some impressive results along the way. The auto company reached nearly one million cells per week at the end of 2022 at the Fremont facility.\n\nAlso Read : Tesla abandons BMW, Mercedes battle to take on the likes of Ford\n\nDuring the Q1 2023 earnings call, Tesla's senior vice president of engineering Drew Baglino said that the cell factory is currently being built and commissioned. ‚ÄúFor the Cell Factory, for the Texas 4680 factory, we are part way through building and commissioning and installing and operating, will be 70% lower capex per gigawatt hour than typical cell factories when fully ramped in line with what we described on Battery Day. And we‚Äôre continuing to further pursue densification and investment reduction opportunities in future factory buildouts like in Nevada,\" he said.\n\nAlso check these Cars Find more Cars UPCOMING Tesla Model S ‚Çπ70 Lakhs - 1 Cr* *Expected Price View Details UPCOMING Tesla Model 3 ‚Çπ70 - 90 Lakhs* *Expected Price View Details UPCOMING Mercedes-benz Eqe ‚Çπ70 - 90 Lakhs* *Expected Price View Details Mercedes-benz V-class ‚Çπ71.1 Lakhs - 1.46 Cr* Ex-showroom price Add to compare Check latest offers Mercedes-benz Eqb ‚Çπ74.5 Lakhs* *Ex-showroom price Add to compare Check latest offers\n\nSpeaking about the cell's design, he hinted that the company has further advanced from what it showcased during the Battery Day event three years ago. ‚ÄúOn the cell design, we‚Äôre in production with not only the first generation tabless cell we unveiled on Battery Day, but a second more manufacturable version in Texas today. On the cathode material side, we have a number of activities underway per the Battery Day roadmap. For lithium, our Corpus Christi Lithium Refinery breaks ground this May. Our goal is to start commissioning portions of the facility for the end of the year. The refinery uses the sulfate-free refining process with reduced process costs, no acid or caustic reagents, and lower embodied energy. It actually produces a beneficial byproduct that can be re-purposed in construction materials,\" added Baglino. He also added that the priority is now to reduce the cost of production as much as possible in preparation for the Cybertruck production ramp-up, which is expected to take place at the beginning of 2024.\n\nFirst Published Date:",

		"body": "Elon Musk seems a lot less sure about how Tesla could benefit from Twitter or the new X company the social media platform is now operating under ‚Äì something he promised would happen to Tesla shareholders last year.\n\nFinancially speaking, Tesla shareholders are those who suffered the most from Elon Musk‚Äôs Twitter acquisition.\n\nThe CEO had to sell tens of billions of dollars‚Äô worth of Tesla stock to acquire the social media platform, which heavily contributed to a crash in Tesla‚Äôs stock. Some also suggested that Musk‚Äôs behavior on the platform has been negatively affecting his and Tesla‚Äôs credibility with buyers and investors.\n\nAmid the crash late last year, Musk claimed that he would ‚Äúmake sure Tesla shareholders benefit from Twitter long-term,‚Äù but he didn‚Äôt explain how.\n\nDuring Tesla‚Äôs earnings call following the release of its Q1 2023 financial results, Musk was asked if he had more clarity about how Twitter or a new X.com/super app would potentially help Tesla‚Äôs business model and shareholders.\n\nIn his response, the CEO seemed a lot less sure about the benefits, seemingly having forgotten his promise made to shareholders last year:\n\nWell, I don‚Äôt know. I guess it could make it potentially easier to buy cars? Somewhat off-topic here, because I think there‚Äôs some benefit. I think probably there‚Äôs some benefit, yes.\n\nThis didn‚Äôt do anything to squash concerns about Musk losing interest in Tesla since the Twitter acquisition, especially following reports that he is building a new AI company to compete with OpenAI.\n\nThis move has been concerning to Tesla investors since he initially severed ties with OpenAI due to a conflict of interest with Tesla‚Äôs own AI effort and recruitment.\n\nSince then, Tesla has doubled down its efforts to build AI products ‚Äì primarily to power its self-driving program, but also through its Tesla Bot humanoid robot.\n\nMusk actually went so far as to claim that Tesla has the strongest AI team in the world, saying he believes the company would ‚Äúplay a role in developing artificial general intelligence (AGI).‚Äù\n\nYet he is now reportedly starting a company separate from Tesla to develop AI products.\n\nElectrek‚Äôs Take\n\nI think this should be the top concern for Tesla investors or at least the top problem within the company‚Äôs control. Macroeconomics and interest rates are not really within Tesla‚Äôs control, but its CEO is to a degree, and having a CEO who is focused on multiple major ventures unrelated to Tesla is a genuine concern.\n\nIt was one thing when it was just SpaceX and a little time spent on The Boring Company, but now with Twitter and a new AI company, it‚Äôs starting to be a lot, especially when he is in charge of arguably the world‚Äôs most critical company when it comes to transitioning the world to a sustainable energy economy.\n\nI think Musk is too used to being able to do whatever he wants, and it is starting to affect some of his decisions negatively. It was helpful when people were telling him that his ambitious goals were impossible, but now it is beginning to be a problem.\n\nHow was the question ‚Äúsomewhat off-topic‚Äù when he was directly asked what plans he has for Twitter that will positively affect Tesla shareholders ‚Äì something he said would happen?\n\nI think it‚Äôs a fair question, and he clearly doesn‚Äôt have the answer to it, making his promise a lot less credible.\n\nUltimately, that‚Äôs a big part of the problem. He is losing credibility. The man has accomplished some incredible things, things that many thought would never happen or not happen for years to come. That has given him a ton of credibility with a lot of people, especially Tesla shareholders.\n\nI know many people still think he is just a charlatan, but I personally believe the credibility he gained from his part in building Tesla and SpaceX is warranted. But I also see how he is currently losing some of that credibility.",

His predictions since at least 2019 that autonomous Teslas are just around the corner have not panned out.\n\n‚ÄúWe are the only ones making cars that technically we could sell for zero profit for now, and then yield actually tremendous economics in the future through autonomy,‚Äù Musk said April 19. ‚ÄúI am not sure how many of you will appreciate the profundity of what I have just said, but it is extremely significant.‚Äù\n\nThe challenge Musk has had turning driverless visions into reality is not stopping him from going forward with markdowns that threaten to set off a price war. The company has lowered the cost of its top-selling Model Y by 29 percent in the span of just a few months.\n\nThat has dented the company‚Äôs margins and spooked investors concerned about deteriorating profits.",

		"title": "Tesla threatens mass-market Renault and Ford as prices fall",
		"body": "Tesla has entered a new era: one in which Elon Musk keeps a different set of car executives up at night, while others rest a little easier.\n\nIn the decade since the Model S launched, Tesla has been taking customers largely from luxury players led by BMW and Mercedes-Benz. While Musk had ambitions to take on mass manufacturers with a $35,000 Model 3, he ended up charging much more ‚Äî first out of necessity to keep Tesla afloat, and then because he and the broader industry were production constrained.\n\nAround this time last year, Tesla‚Äôs CEO set wheels in motion to change all that, opening two new plants. With Musk keen on expansion and less concerned about earnings, Ford and Renault bosses are now among the ones looking nervously in their rear view mirror.\n\n‚ÄúPrice wars are breaking out everywhere,‚Äù Ford CEO Jim Farley said Thursday at a charity event in Detroit, days after Renault said it was examining how its models are positioned. ‚ÄúWho is going to blink for growth?‚Äù\n\nLuxury automakers will not be totally immune to pricing pressure ‚Äî Mercedes cut the sticker prices on its EVs in China late last year, weeks after Tesla started cutting.\n\nBut German executives have been adamant about their unwillingness to follow Musk in compromising brand value for volume.\n\nIf anything, Mercedes CEO Ola Kallenius wants to move further upmarket, as this strategy has been paying dividends. The manufacturer said late Thursday that earnings were stronger than expected in the first quarter, driven by resilient pricing.\n\n‚ÄúTesla is not only sacrificing its EV margins to achieve its volume ambitions. To some extent, it is also placing the goodwill and brand equity that it has built up on the altar too,‚Äù Daniel Roeska, Bernstein‚Äôs European auto analyst, wrote in a report Thursday.\n\n‚ÄúThis is most important in the premium end of the market, where brand perception and social status are the crux of sales,‚Äù Roeska said.\n\nMusk‚Äôs markdowns have been dramatic and swift. In the U.S., Tesla has cut the starting price of its top-selling Model Y SUV by 29 percent in three months.\n\nThat is an issue for Ford, which recently discounted its Mustang Mach-E SUV by about $4,500 on average to stay competitive. While the automaker pulled ahead of General Motors last year as the No. 2 seller of EVs in the U.S., it remains well behind Tesla.\n\nWith Ford lacking the economies of scale Musk has built and investing heavily to catch up, the company has forecast a $3 billion loss for its electric vehicle business this year.\n\nRenault is planning to go a step further than Ford ‚Äî not only separating its EV and combustion engine business, but planning an initial public offering for its plug-in car and software operations. The head of the Renault brand, Fabrice Cambolive, called Tesla‚Äôs price cuts a clear challenge, and investors sold off the French company‚Äôs stock on Thursday despite its strong first-quarter sales.\n\nWhile fielding several questions on the sustainability of the 42,000 euro ($46,000) sticker on the electric Megane E-Tech hatchback, Chief Financial Officer Thierry Pi√©ton acknowledged that overall pricing may be ‚Äúa little softer‚Äù in the second half. Still, he said Renault is not planning any drastic changes.\n\n‚ÄúThere is no big incentive to go cut the prices and kill residuals and go in a spiral that some of the competition is following,‚Äù Pi√©ton said.",

		"title": "Tesla Model Y tops EU27 Q1 chart",
		"body": "According to JATO data for 27 European markets, the Tesla Model Y was the topselling passenger car both in March and for Q1 2023.\n\nThe popular EV had topped a monthly ranking previously but March 2023 was the first time that the model had topped the year to date (YRD) ranking. This signals a significant difference from Q1 last year, when the Model Y was 31st.\n\nFelipe Munoz, global analyst at JATO Dynamics, said: ‚Äú[An] increase in production alongside fewer supply chain issues enabled Tesla to finally deliver vehicles to its customers at pace. The Model Y will likely be among the five best selling products in Europe at the end of this year.‚Äù\n\nHowever, the success of the Model Y came at the expense of the Model 3 which achieved fewer registrations, down 42% in March and 40% in Q1.\n\nMunoz added: ‚ÄúGiven the popularity of SUVs, it is perhaps unsurprising that the Model Y has risen in demand, in comparison to its sedan peer.‚Äù\n\nLast month, the number of European new car registrations increased by 26% to 1,414,815 units, and by 17% in Q1 to 3,220,806 units, the highest since 2019.\n\nMunoz: ‚ÄúThe increase in registrations is largely explained by accumulated orders from months previous that could not be delivered due to the lack of components at the time. We‚Äôll be watching closely to see how this growth is impacted by further inflationary pressure in the coming months.‚Äù\n\nBEVs were a strong driver of this growth. More than half of registrations in Q1 were BEVs with volume increasing 43% in March to 219,000 units. More models, lower prices, and appealing incentive packages across all markets contributed to this rise in demand. Market share was 13.4% ‚Äì a record Q1 high.\n\nTesla accounted for 28% of all BEV registrations in March, and 22% for Q1. Munoz, added: ‚ÄúTesla is showing stronger results this year than seen in 2022, despite the record set last year. However, the speed of growth would have been even faster had it not been for the triumph of the Model Y and the subsequent lack of registrations of the Model 3.‚Äù\n\nThe Volkswagen Group came only 2,400 units behind Tesla in the Q1 ranking, with its total BEV volume up by 57%. Even during the reigning period for Tesla, VW‚Äôs rise equalled Tesla‚Äôs. With Volkswagen performing better in March, registrations grew by 75% in comparison to Tesla‚Äôs 44%. Geely Group, SAIC Group, and Toyota also produced good results in the BEV market during Q1.\n\n\n\nSAIC Group (MG and Maxus) enjoyed positive results. With the popularity of the recently introduced MG 4, the Chinese manufacturer continued to climb the rankings. In March, MG made the top 10 BEV ranking of OEMs ‚Äì ahead of Nissan, Toyota, and Ford. The MG 4 achieved fourth place in the top 10 BEV ranking, too.\n\nMG, JATO said, ‚Äúis a prime example of how Chinese OEMs can thrive in western markets, using a reputable western brand and selling a competitive product‚Äù.\n\nToyota, still marginal in terms of BEV volume, registered 3,700 units of the bZ4X. This saw the manufacturer‚Äôs overall BEV volume grow by 437% during the quarter. Remarkably, Toyota outsold Ford in Q1. Nevertheless, its figures lagged behind the large volume posted by the majority of its European counterparts and Hyundai-Kia.",

Ives noted that Musk himself threw his hat in the ring with the recent announcement of X.AI, which he intends to compete with major AI systems.\n\nThe Wedbush analyst sees Musk making a push to join the ranks of Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, citing the thousands of Nvidia graphics processing chips the multi-billionaire has already purchased in pursuit of large-scale language models.\n\nIves also has thoughts on how Musk's forays into AI can boost shares of his crown jewel: Tesla. He sees three ways its implementation can help drive stock gains in the future.\n\nThe first relates to the impact on Tesla's full self-driving service, for which AI can improve \"performance optimization and redundancy,\" according to Ives.\n\nSecondly, Ives said AI will enable Tesla to make further enhancements to its robotics systems, such as the company's humanoid robot Optimus.\n\n\"That could lead to further improvements of Tesla's supply chain by opening up limitless labor supply for production lines while improving its cost structure during a labor constrained environment,\" he wrote.\n\nIves' last argument is that Dojo ‚Äî a custom supercomputing platform developed by Tesla ‚Äî can have its training models fine-tuned more quickly as more attention and resources are spent on AI. This will, in tune, help Dojo further enhance the full self-driving initiative mentioned above.\n\n\"Overall, Tesla is in a great position to benefit from the implementation of Generative AI into its product suite and into its business model to further accelerate profitable growth,\" Ives concluded.",

		"title": "Tesla Semi's dream battery that can replace diesel as heavy-duty ...",
		"body": "A power cell that can reportedly last for the lifespan of an 18-wheeler has been announced by the battery innovators from Northvolt. Created in cooperation with Scania trucks, the cell could eventually last 1.5 million kilometers before degradation sets in, or the life cycle of the big rig itself, replacing diesel as a fuel in the process.\n\n4 Reviews\n\nThe creators of the first battery Gigafactory in Europe - Northvolt - have now unveiled an electric vehicle battery crafted specifically with long-haul electric rigs like the Tesla Semi in mind. The cell was developed in partnership with truck maker Scania, which gave input on what features it would like to see in a battery that could replace diesel as the fuel of choice for heavy-duty, long-haul applications.\n\nFirst in the demand line was the cell's longevity, and Scania settled on a number that its semi buyers would be comfortable with, namely 1.5 million kilometers (about 932 thousand miles). That million-mile battery would provide what diesel does now - many years of operation plus torque in the low rpms - which big rig buyers would want to see before they pull the trigger on anything that is not a diesel engine.\n\nNorthvolt's cells that would go into such an 18-wheeler truck battery are of the prismatic \"chewing gum\" type, and have a capacity of 157 Ah each with nominal voltage of 3.6 V. Mum's the word on the exact technology and chemistry that Northvolt used in the development of the million-mile battery in partnership with Scania since 2017. According to Scania's CEO Christian Levin:\n\nAs the development of the battery cell started, we targeted high performance, low operating costs and long lifetime. We decided on a requirement for the cell to enable a 1.5 million kilometers long lifetime for a heavy-duty Scania vehicle. The tests show that this requirement can not only be met, but also exceeded.\n\nThe two companies also didn't specify what kinds of tests they did on the heavy-duty truck battery, as it would be interesting to see how it performs in cold weather like the one in their native Sweden. Operating an electric vehicle in freezing temps can easily half their range without preconditioning.\n\nScania's focus, however, seems to have been on the battery's longevity and the operating costs of a vehicle equipped with it, as its current electric rigs are mainly for \"regional long-haul,\" like Tesla's Semi. Lifespan is what its customers would be more interested in, rather than range on a charge, since prematurely replacing a huge pack enough to power an 18-wheeler would be prohibitively expensive.\n\nNorthvolt also goes a step further, as usual, and derives the power for the production of the battery from renewable sources, lowering the carbon footprint of the cells by two thirds compared to current ternary batteries. The new cells are already being made at Northvolt's Ett Gigafactory in Sweden, while Scania is building a dedicated plant for the long-haul truck battery that will become operational later this year, manufacturing cells ready to go into its heavy-duty electric rigs.\n\nGet the 48A Tesla Wall Connector with 24\" cable on Amazon",

Electric models were less than 8% of the state‚Äôs new car market in 2020, according to vehicle registration data from the California Energy Commission.\n\nCalifornia has long dominated the electric car market in the United States due to aggressive tailpipe regulations designed to phase out emissions that are known to harm human health and drive global climate change by trapping heat in the atmosphere.\n\nBut the state is only at the start of what‚Äôs likely to be a rapid transition. The number of clean cars is expected to grow exponentially due to a regulation that requires most new cars sold in California to be zero-emission by 2035.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat are the most popular electric vehicles?\n\nTesla is, without question, the dominant player in the market. It has been the top-selling EV brand since 2018. Moreover, the company‚Äôs Model 3 and Model Y are now the top-selling new cars in the state, far outselling the top three most popular gas-powered models (Toyota‚Äôs RAV4, Camry and Corolla, according to the California New Car Dealers Association).\n\nThat said, Tesla has seen its market share drop in recent months, particularly as it faces growing competition from other manufacturers in the clean car space, including BMW, Chevy and Jeep.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere in California are people buying electric vehicles?\n\nDrivers are most likely to own an electric vehicle in the Bay Area, especially in wealthy enclaves of Silicon Valley, where most people live in single-family homes. San Mateo County had the highest per capita rate of electric sales last year, with 21 EVs sold per 1,000 residents. Meanwhile, Santa Clara County had the highest percentage of new cars sold that were EVs, with 34%.\n\nHow much have sales increased?\n\nElectric cars were about 2% of the new car market in California a decade ago. Sales slowly grew until 2018, when the mass release of Tesla‚Äôs Model 3 changed the game. Sales have soared in the years since, thanks to a host of factors, including sky-high gasoline prices, more variety in electric models, strong government subsidies for buyers and less consumer hesitancy. Electric vehicles now account for more than 21% of the market.\n\nCredits Reporting and graphics by and . Reporting by . Editing by , , and .",

		"body": "‚ÄúWe had our position of what we thought was reasonable, Tesla had their position, and we were unable to find something that could work for both organisations.‚Äù\n\nCore now has contracts to sell its lithium to less famous consumers such as Chinese industrial company Sichuan Yahua.\n\nFor all the glamour that comes with announcing a mineral supply agreement with Tesla, the terms offered by the world‚Äôs pre-eminent electric vehicle brand are rarely the most generous in the market, according to multiple boardroom sources in the Australian mining industry.\n\nTesla is well aware of its brand power and has been known to factor that into negotiations for supply of metals such as lithium, nickel and graphite. For small and little-known battery minerals producers, the halo effect of being associated with Tesla‚Äôs brand might be worth a cheaper rate on mineral sales.\n\nEven for big miners such as BHP, which sells Australian nickel to Tesla, a supply contract is a valuable public relations tool to illustrate a strategy pivot towards ‚Äúfuture facing‚Äù metals rather than the coal mines that generate dramatically more revenue.\n\nManderson says he was determined to make sure last year‚Äôs cancellation of talks with Tesla was respectful, rational and not necessarily the end of the road. ‚ÄúWe are still very comfortable having conversations with Tesla about offtake, that door is still open,‚Äù he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n‚ÄúWe need to be playing the long game here. At the end of the day, it is about being a mature business.‚Äù\n\nManderson‚Äôs determination to play ‚Äúthe long game‚Äù chafes against the market perception that has followed Core over a spectacular three years in which it surged into the S & P/ASX 200 on the back of a 25-fold share price rally.\n\nAccording to the dominant market narrative, Core has been fast to market with a small resource that will struggle to support a long-life, low-cost mine.\n\nThose perceptions were partly built on truth. Core swiftly developed a small mine called Grants about 90 kilometres south of Darwin port. It was initially expected to have a lifespan of about four years, although that has since been extended to about seven.\n\nHigh prices\n\nThe first delivery of Core‚Äôs lithium-rich spodumene concentrate from Grants reached Darwin port early this month, and payment is expected before the end of the month, meaning the company has started selling lithium while prices remain high.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCRU analyst Martin Jackson said spodumene concentrate was fetching about $US4500 ($6719) a tonne in Chinese daily ‚Äúspot‚Äù markets in the first week of April. That price is down from about $US6000 a tonne in December, but is still astronomically high compared to the $US400 a tonne the commodity was fetching in mid-2020.\n\nMost experts expect prices to fall further. Barrenjoey is predicting a return to $US2500 a tonne in 2024 and $US2000 a tonne in 2025, before settling at a long-term level of $US1500 a tonne.\n\nThe argument that Core will flame out when the Grants mine is exhausted fails to recognise the bigger strategy to develop numerous small mines in the Finniss province around Grants.\n\nThe next mine is likely to be less than 4 kilometres from Grants at a prospect called BP33, and subsequent pits will need to be developed at other nearby prospects.\n\n‚ÄúWe need to be good at opening and closing mines that have a four- to six-year timeframe,‚Äù says Manderson of the key technical challenge that will determine success or failure for Core.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCore‚Äôs collective mine life at Finniss across its multiple prospects is about 12 years, according to its latest statement of reserves and resources.\n\n‚ÄúNot a bad base to start with,‚Äù says Manderson, who spent two decades with Rio Tinto before joining Core.\n\nDrilling results published on April 18 increased the official resource at Finniss by 62 per cent. Further analysis will be required before the new drilling officially adds to mine life, but investors took it as a sign there was further value to be unlocked at Finniss; Core shares rallied 6.5 per cent during the April 18 trading session.\n\nThe surge means Core has rallied 30 per cent since March 23, inflicting pain on the short sellers that have bet on its shares falling.\n\nMore than 10 per cent of Core shares were sold short as of March 22, and the company was still the fifth-most shorted stock on the ASX on April 12, when 9.3 per cent of the register was in the hands of hedge funds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany lithium stocks have been targeted by short sellers this year as investors bet that prices for the battery mineral will slide, but Core‚Äôs strategy to develop numerous small mines has equally frightened some investors who fear it will face a recurring capital spending bill.\n\nMacquarie analysts are less concerned on that point; they predict Core will generate $162 million of free cash flow in the year to June 2024 after accounting for spending on new mines.\n\nMacquarie reckons free cash flow will exceed $600 million in each of the subsequent two years, although that forecast was based on spodumene prices above $US5000 a tonne.\n\nCore has not provided the market with formal volume guidance, but the broker expects the company to produce about 80,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate in the year to June 2024, then closer to 180,000 tonnes in each of the subsequent nine years.\n\nMacquarie‚Äôs model assumes Core is still producing spodumene concentrate at Finniss in 2039, an expression of confidence that raw drilling data will eventually be converted into official reserves and bankable mine life.\n\nCore‚Äôs plan to develop numerous small mines that service a single processing hub at Finniss is unusual in the Australian lithium sector and the opposite of the approach taken by rival lithium star Liontown Resources, which has gradually drilled out a single, large deposit at Western Australia‚Äôs Kathleen Valley.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiontown‚Äôs exceptionally large orebody is very well understood and will support at least 23 years of mine life at one location, but the studious approach to design and development means Kathleen Valley remains at least a year ‚Äì and hundreds of millions of dollars of extra investment ‚Äì away from first sales.\n\nLiontown‚Äôs more patient strategy is not wrong; on the contrary, it has been vindicated by a $5.5 billion takeover offer from US giant Albemarle.\n\nBut the point is what works for Liontown‚Äôs big asset almost 700 kilometres from the nearest port does not necessarily suit Core, whose proximity to Darwin port makes more marginal orebodies viable.\n\n‚ÄúCore is producing concentrate a lot earlier than our peers, but we don‚Äôt have the same support of a resource base because the drilling and exploration base just hasn‚Äôt been done across the leases,‚Äù says Manderson, who is in his eighth month in charge.\n\n‚ÄúOnly something like about 10 per cent of the [Core] land area has been touched.‚Äù\n\nThat will change fast. Core has promised to double exploration spending to $25 million this year to unlock the secrets that lie within its vast tenement package. Manderson hopes that work can gradually put to rest investor concerns that Core is here for a good time, but not a long time.\n\n‚ÄúWe need to do the exploration work to understand what the opportunity might be either in terms of extension of mine life or increasing production,‚Äù he says.",

		"body": "By\n\nDaiwa Capital recently reiterated an ‚ÄúOutperform‚Äù rating on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) amidst the electric vehicle maker‚Äôs aggressive pricing strategy. The firm, however, lowered its price target on TSLA stock to $185.00 from $218.00. The adjustment comes as Tesla leverages its pricing power to drive growth in volume.\n\n‚ÄúTesla‚Äôs commitment to growing volumes by using price as a clearing mechanism is likely to put continued pressure on margins. We, therefore, conservatively model sequential declines in gross margins through 4Q23 for a 17% average in 2023E. Our 2023E, 2024E, and 2025E EPS estimates go to $2.95, $5.00, and $6.15, respectively, from $3.75, $6, and $7.25.\n\n‚ÄúWhile contentious, we believe Tesla is best positioned to execute a volume-over-margin strategy, given its runway to cut cost per unit and generate revenue over the vehicle‚Äôs lifecycle,‚Äù the Daiwa analysts wrote.\n\nDuring the Q1 2023 earnings call, Tesla executives highlighted that the company is prioritizing volume growth at the expense of margin. CEO Elon Musk even noted that Tesla could sell its cars at very little profit since the company‚Äôs vehicles could generate post-sale revenue from products such as autonomous driving. Musk has noted that Tesla‚Äôs autonomous driving program is a crucial part of the company‚Äôs long-term potential.\n\n‚ÄúTesla is in a uniquely strong strategic position. Because we‚Äôre the only ones making cars that, technically, we could sell for zero profit for now and then yield actually tremendous economics in the future through autonomy, no one else can do that. I‚Äôm not sure how many people will appreciate the profundity of what I‚Äôve just said, but it is extremely significant,‚Äù Musk said.\n\nInterestingly enough, the analysts took a particular focus on the CFO‚Äôs comments about Tesla‚Äôs capacity to reinvest, which led Daiwa to concentrate on the company‚Äôs free cash flow margins, as noted in an Investing.com report. This metric stood at 9% in the first quarter, which suggests that there is still additional room for price cuts before lower margins start impacting Tesla‚Äôs reinvestment capabilities.\n\nDisclosure: I am long TSLA.\n\nDon‚Äôt hesitate to contact us with news tips.

		"body": "Ford filed a patent for gullwing door for SUVs in October of 2021 which was only published recently on April 20 by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). These doors are hinged at the roofline and open upward, creating a dramatic entrance and exit for the vehicle. However, gullwing doors are not new in the automotive industry as Tesla has made it quite famous through its Model X EV.\n\nIn fact, Mercedes-Benz 300 SL in the 1950s was the vehicle in which gullwing doors were first introduced. But Ford's patent is a bit different from others as the OEM has introduced a single, massive gullwing door that opens to the side. The design is such that it makes the vehicle look asymmetrical, especially when viewed from the top.\n\nAlso Read : Ford's plans of deploying thousands of self-drive vehicles hits a major roadblock\n\nNotably, there is a separate door for the driver to enter from. And while the gullwing door gives the vehicle an aesthetic appeal, it also has practical advantages. It tends to provide ample space for passengers to enter and exit the vehicle with ease and comfort. The huge entrance opening can also lead to further designs that support persons with disabilities, who find it difficult to enter and exit vehicles through standard doors. It can also allow for easier loading and unloading of cargo, especially large and bulky items.\n\nAlso check these Cars Find more Cars DISCONTINUED Ford Ecosport 1496 cc | Petrol | Manual | 15.9 kmpl ‚Çπ7.99 - 11.78 Lakhs* *Last recorded price Add to compare View Details Maruti Suzuki Brezza ‚Çπ7.99 - 13.96 Lakhs* *Ex-showroom price Add to compare Check latest offers UPCOMING Jeep Avenger ‚Çπ8 - 12 Lakhs* *Expected Price View Details UPCOMING Kia Sonet Facelift ‚Çπ8 - 15 Lakhs* *Expected Price View Details UPCOMING Honda Wr-v 2023 ‚Çπ8 - 10 Lakhs* *Expected Price View Details UPCOMING Mahindra Ekuv100 ‚Çπ8.25 - 10 Lakhs* *Expected Price View Details\n\nIn a separate development, Ford has reportedly ended production of the sixth-generation Mustang.

The sixth-gen Ford Mustang debuted in December 2013 and went on sale in 2015. Since then, the car has had several engines, including the popular 2.3-litre EcoBoost four-cylinder unit, a V6 and a 5.0-litre V8.

This latest round was led by Wellington Management.\n\nSPAN, whose CEO, Arch Rao, is the former head of products at Tesla, began selling its smart electrical panel in 2020. As consumers electrify their homes, the panel is able to give consumers more control over and insight into how their homes are using energy.\n\nIn other words, the SPAN Panel, which balances and monitors power flow, is an alternative to a full electrical upgrade for homeowners. The panel is much pricier than an analog panel at $4,500, but it might cost less than a full electrical upgrade.\n\nThe company says it will use its capital to develop an R&D facility near its San Francisco headquarters that will feature a microgrid environment where products will be tested in on- and off-grid scenarios.\n\nIt will also expand its partnership reach to new categories, including major home appliances, smart home devices, and grid integrations.\n\nRao told Electrek:\n\nWhen consumers upgrade to more efficient electric appliances, high-speed EV charging, solar, and battery storage, too often they have to settle for a less-than-stellar customer experience or make expensive electrical service upgrades. This new funding strengthens our technology leadership and continues to advance our development of the most integrated home electrification technology ‚Äì providing homeowners the ultimate experience with maximum value in comfort, control, battery backup, and savings.\n\nSPAN rolled out its Drive EV charger last year in partnership with rooftop solar company Sunrun, and it also has a partnership with home appliance company Kenmore.\n\nRead more: SPAN‚Äôs new Level 2 EV charger works even if your house has less than 200 amp service\n\nPhoto: SPAN\n\nUnderstandSolar is a free service that links you to top-rated solar installers in your region for personalized solar estimates.

By Mustafa Gatollari Apr. 24 2023, Updated 9:23 a.m. ET\n\nIf you own a piece of real estate or a vehicle, there are a number of applications that'll allow you to make money off of these possessions. If you don't mind putting some mileage on one of your whips, then you could drive folks around on Uber. If the idea of strangers staying at your property in exchange for money is fine by you, then you can rent it out on Vrbo or Airbnb. And if you're looking for a more \"hands-off\" approach, you can even be a miniature car rental service with Turo.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThink of it as Airbnb for cars without having to go through a car rental agency. Maybe there's a specific vehicle that you really wanted to try out for a day or two, there's a good chance that you're going to find it on Turo as there's probably a greater variety of folks' personal cars on the platform than let's say the offerings at Enterprise or Alamo, which usually deals with fleet vehicles that are a bit easier to maintain en masse.\n\nA really popular vehicle on Turo, for instance, are Teslas. Although sales of the brand are steadily increasing with each quarter and more and more of them are on the road, many feel that its either impractical or out of their budget to own and operate the fully electric vehicles on a daily basis. However, driving one while they're visiting somewhere on vacation, or getting one for the day is another story.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nUsually, these are the kinds of clients that tend to rent Teslas, and the vehicles are pretty good money makers on the platform. However, one Tesla renter encountered something that sounds like some kind of nightmare scenario that your paranoid uncle who thinks all share-apps of any nature are a scam. Realtor/Investor Frank Valdez rented out a red Tesla Model 3 on Turo.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSource: TikTok | @frankvidz\n\nWhen you sync a Tesla to your smartphone, you receive notifications about pretty much anything that's going on with your car. If there's an increase in cabin temperature, the ac will kick on automatically to make sure it doesn't get unbearably hot and create a mobile greenhouse. If someone is trying to break into your car or someone's rammed it, your Tesla will notify you via your smartphone.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSource: TikTok | @frankvidz\n\nYou can remotely enable the car's cameras to see what's going on, which is exactly what Frank did once he received a slew of notifications on his vehicle that led him to believe someone was messing around with it.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSource: TikTok | @frankvidz\n\nHe checked the car's GPS coordinates and enabled Sentry mode (its camera system) and saw that there were some folks working on the car. When he went to the vehicle's location, he saw it was an auto body shop.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSource: TikTok | @frankvidz\n\nHe saw that an uncolored aftermarket bumper was on the vehicle, replacing its original one. When Frank told the shop owner he was going to notify the authorities, the shop owner promised he'd have the vehicle returned to its original condition in two hours.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSource: TikTok | @frankvidz\n\nWhile Frank initially thought that the shop owner was trying to swap his OG parts with aftermarket ones, the shop owner said that they had rented the Model 3 in order to test aftermarket parts he had ordered. Which makes sense: since Teslas are relatively new vehicles their parts cost a lot and if aftermarket solutions work, there are probably plenty of customers who want to try and fix their cars more affordably.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSource: TikTok | @frankvidz\n\nThe ethics behind renting a car in order to swap out parts, even for testing, especially on such a tech-centric vehicle wasn't lost on Frank's TikTok audience. The wiring harnesses and various sensors on the Tesla could've been damaged or misaligned/mis-calibrated as a result of the swap. But there were plenty of TikTok users who thought that the bumper was being primed to paint and that the shop owner was planning a bait and switch.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSource: TikTok | @frankvidz\n\nWhat do you think? Was Frank overreacting or would you be miffed to discover someone rented your car on Turo, only to experiment on it? Or was the shop owner just lying at the moment and playing the con on other Turo renters?\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nUpdate: A representative from communications firm Sunshine Sachs Morgan & Lylis reached out to Distractify via email to clarify that Turo is looking into this matter. According to their correspondence, the body shop owner in question has indeed violated the app's policy. Their statement is featured below:",

		"body": "BYD, the Chinese automaker that brought you the jumping active suspension sports car a couple of weeks ago, is not all show; it's also one of the leading EV manufacturers in China just behind Tesla. A year ago, the company announced a partnership with Nvidia's Hyperion self-driving technology, which is the same tech used by Jaguar, Polestar, Volvo, Mercedes, Lucid, and a bunch of Chinese manufacturers. But now, company reps are saying self-driving technology is still a long way off‚Äîif it ever goes mainstream at all.\n\nSpeaking to a group of reporters at last week's Shanghai auto show, a BYD representative suggested that self-driving tech may never get good enough, but the world may never be ready for it. \"We think self-driving tech that's fully separated from humans is very, very far away, and basically impossible,\" Li Yunfei, a spokesperson for BYD, said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC.\n\n\"When we think about [self-driving tech] from all aspects, from human psychological safety needs, from ethics, from regulation, from technology‚Äîincluding application in this industry‚Äîwe haven't figured out [the logic] and we think it is probably a false proposition,\" Li told CNBC. \"There may be many industries and businesses that invest a lot of money on this [tech], and after investing for many years it will prove it leads nowhere.\"\n\nLike in the U.S., Chinese development of self-driving vehicles on the ground has so far only taken shape in approved regions with permission from local authorities, CNBC reports. BYD's rep is now suggesting that it may never expand beyond a locked geographical area that the technology is permitted to operate in, like Waymo's testing on the streets of Arizona's cities, or an automated robot traversing a factory building.\n\nSee all 15 photos See all 15 photos",

		"body": "In a world full of dreamers and visionaries, there are a select few who stand out from the rest. And at the forefront of this elite group is a man who has disrupted industries, revolutionized technology, and sparked the imaginations of millions. Elon Musk, a South African-born entrepreneur and business magnate, is best known for his ventures in electric cars, space exploration, and renewable energy.\n\n\n\nWithout any further ado, let‚Äôs quickly take a look through his journey, companies owned, net worth and more.\n\nElon Musk: Journey\n\nMusk‚Äôs entrepreneurial journey began in 1995 when he founded Zip2, a company that provided online business directories and maps. He later sold Zip2 for $307 million in 1999 and co-founded PayPal, an online payment system that was sold to eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002.\n\nAfter PayPal, Musk founded SpaceX, a company that aims to make space travel affordable and accessible to everyone. In addition to SpaceX, Musk is the CEO of Tesla, which produces electric cars, energy storage systems, and solar products. He is also the CEO of Neuralink, a company that is working on developing brain-machine interfaces, and The Boring Company, which aims to build underground transportation systems.\n\nElon Musk: Companies owned\n\nMusk owns several companies, including SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, and The Boring Company. He has also been involved in other ventures, such as SolarCity, which was acquired by Tesla in 2016.

But if he is concerned about how abortion is leading to fewer births, he might consider not subsidizing those who have abortions or undergo sterilizations, and he also might want to think about how his work expectations are (or aren't) aligned with the needs of parents.\n\nSEE IT: ELON MUSK SAYS ADULTS STERILIZING CHILDREN DESERVE 'PRISON FOR LIFE'\n\n‚ÄúWell, it's just, in the past, we could rely upon, you know, simple limbic system rewards in order to procreate,‚Äù Musk told Carlson. ‚ÄúBut once you have birth control and abortions and whatnot, now you can still satisfy limbic instinct, but not procreate.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI'm sort of worried that hey, civilization, if we don't make enough people to at least sustain our numbers, perhaps increase a little bit, then civilization's going to crumble,‚Äù Musk said.\n\nWhy, then, does Tesla pay to eliminate pre-born babies and make women infertile? According to the LGBT group Human Rights Campaign, Tesla provides ‚Äúequal health coverage for transgender individuals without exclusion for medically necessary care,‚Äù which includes sterilization .\n\nTesla also helps employees who want to travel out of pro-life states to have abortions.\n\nIt is an axiom of economics that Musk should understand: If you want more of something, subsidize it, and if you want less of something, tax it or make it more expensive.\n\nI could not find any direct evidence Twitter also pays for abortions and sterilizations, but given the support for abortion in the Big Tech industry, it seems likely the social media company does pay for those procedures. Regardless, at least one of Musk‚Äôs companies definitively does subsidize the elimination of pre-born babies and procedures that make it impossible for women to bear children.\n\nYet Musk understands the problems society will face if succeeding generations get smaller and smaller.\n\n‚ÄúThe old question of, like, ‚ÄòWill civilization end with a bang or a whimper?‚Äô Well, it‚Äôs currently trying to end with a whimper in adult diapers, which is depressing as hell,‚Äù Musk said.\n\nHe is correct in his analysis. But it is pointless to be concerned about an issue and then not only refuse to take part in the solution but be actively involved in the problem.\n\nThere are other steps Musk might take to help encourage childbirth.\n\nHe is open about how he wants employees to work long hours, but if he wants to encourage childbirth, he will need to be more flexible to accommodate both mothers and fathers.\n\n‚ÄúAnyone who wishes to do remote work must be in the office for a minimum (and I mean *minimum*) of 40 hours per week or depart Tesla,‚Äù Musk wrote last year. He also boasted about how he ‚Äúlived in the factory so much.‚Äù\n\nIt is reasonable to require someone to work in an office for 40 hours a week. But his comments indicate he would like people to work more than 40 hours per week.\n\nThis is fine for some people, but he will want to be open to flexible arrangements if he wants to support his female employees. Flexible work is also beneficial to fathers who need to take time off or work from home or have a reasonable work schedule to ensure they can be at home and fulfill their other parenting duties.\n\nIt is good to encourage married couples to have children. Musk should try putting his views on encouraging families into actual practice.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nMatt Lamb is a contributor to the Washington Examiner's Beltway Confidential blog.

		"title": "Tesla Quietly Adds Trip Planner Feature: Long-Distance Travel Now Easier Than Ever",
		"body": "Range anxiety is an evil that still affects many users of electric cars and even more so those who do not dare with sustainable mobility. The fear of getting stranded on the road is normal, but the help of a good phone app can certainly help eliminate that fear. Tesla has the best route planner out there, but up until now it was only available within the car itself. Now thanks to a new update of the application for mobile devices, it will be possible to organize the trip right from home.\n\nThough considered one of the most important functions in any electric car, as a matter of fact very few manufacturers offer this possibility in their browsers. Tesla has the advantage of playing with its own charging infrastructure, but it is also capable of including points from third-party companies, as long as they meet its demanding quality requirements. Many companies are trying to join this privileged network, but very few have actually succeed so far. For some time now, Tesla has been promoting new cargo management companies to join in.\n\nLittle by little the charging network is adding new points, although depending on the regions, it is still a long way from matching the numbers of the USA. The Tesla application now adds a new functionality that is very comfortable: the fact that up until now it has only been available in the vehicle itself has not been a big problem, but for a long time many users have requested that the same functionality be present in the phone app. Thus, upon reaching the car, the browser would already know the details abut our trip without having to waste time in the process.\n\nThe addition of the trip planner is offered as of version 4.20.69 that was just released. Two new features are specified in the release notes: the first is that the pairing of the mobile phone as a key no longer requires the card. The second is a new claim service for Tesla Insurance policyholders (US customers only). As such the planner does not appear in the list of news, but is actually there, as some users have been able to discover; this is something that not many people have managed to understand yet, because it is a fairly important new feature.\n\nScheduling a trip will be as easy as going to the vehicle location tab. Once there, the user just needs to indicate destination and ‚Äúvoila‚Äù, the system automatically calculates distances and stops. It is exactly the same as what up until now could be done directly in the car, but from the comfort of home. Once the route has been set, with the stops included if necessary, it can be sent to the car so that it will not be necessary to re-enter the trip in your car browser. The function allows you to modify the route, add destinations or add new stops.\n\nTesla's mobile app update significantly improves the user experience for electric car owners and potential adopters alike, by tackling range anxiety issues. The addition of the trip planner, although not explicitly mentioned in their release notes, demonstrates Tesla's continuous commitment to enhancing sustainable mobility. Features such as easy-to-schedule trips, seamless location tracking, and third-party charging point integration contribute to making long-distance travel worry-free and effortless. As Tesla's charging infrastructure continues to expand globally, users can anticipate even more improvements and functionalities geared towards the ultimate electric vehicle experience.\n\nSource: hibiridosyelectricos\n\nAll images courtesy of Tesla Inc.\n\nNico Caballero is the VP of Finance of Cogency Power, specializing in solar energy.

		"body": "AN electric car expert has revealed the top five things he wishes he had known before buying a Tesla Model 3.\n\nThe EV expert has owned a Tesla Model 3 for eighteen months and claims he has learnt a lot about these battery-driven cars.\n\n1 The number of Teslas on the road in the UK has jumped by 336% in the past year, rising from 27,000 to 90,900 Credit: Tesla\n\nThe automotive expert @TeslaTorque posted a video on YouTube discussing the drawbacks and advantages of his Tesla Model 3.\n\nHe started the video by saying: \"Heater and winter are bad, I've always been used to running a combustion car, and you have the air conditioning on. It wreaks havoc with the mpg.\n\nWin a Lamborghini from 89p SUN readers can win a Lamborghini Huracan Performante plus ¬£5,000 or ¬£150k cash alternative from just 89p with our special discount code We have teamed up with 7days Performance to offer you a special discounted chance to win the amazing cars this week.

Enter the competition HERE Full terms and conditions can be found here Commercial content notice: Taking one of the offers featured in this article may result in a payment to The Sun. 18+. T&Cs apply.\n\n\"But with an EV, you have to bear in mind that it's actually the heater that drains your battery and ruins your efficiency, not the air conditioning.\n\n\"The air conditioning actually has a minimal effect on your range.\"\n\nThe expert revealed that insuring your Model Tesla 3 can be difficult.\n\nHe added: \"When I went to insure my Model 3, only a handful of companies would actually offer me insurance, and most of those were really expensive.\n\n\"Now, a new one and a big one for electric car owners is the range is not the range, so the advertised range is actually if you took your model 3 from 100% to zero.\n\n\"I recommend keeping your battery between 20 and 80% - and definitely never run it down towards zero because that can cause long-term damage.\n\n\"If you're leasing the Model 3 probably won't be as worried about this, but if you're buying it, then you should really consider it. So that means that if you're trying to keep your Model 3 between 20% and 80% range, you will only use 60% of the capacity.\n\n\"Currently, the Tesla Model 3 is advertised at 278 miles which gives you an actual range of 166 miles.\n\n\"So If you were buying the Tesla Model 3 standard range plus to do, say, a 200-mile commute round trip, in theory, you've got 78 miles to spare, but in reality, you're just short to keep it in that sweet spot.\n\nThe expert claims that cold weather could impact your Tesla range.\n\nHe continued: \"Winter will reduce that 166 miles even more, so you might struggle a little bit without damaging your battery or causing long-term damage.\n\n\"The good news is that for most Model 3 owners - the average in the UK in 2019 was 8.4 miles, but if you are super close to that advertised range on a daily basis, you might want to think about the longer range models.\n\nFortunately, drivers would not have to worry about charging their Teslas when making a long trip, according to the electric car expert.\n\nHe continued: \"The good news for the longer journeys is... look at this new Tesla supercharger map they have produced - there are superchargers popping up all across the country.\"\n\nThis comes after a Tesla owner revealed five reasons why you shouldn't buy one of the US electric cars.\n\nPlus, a driver who swapped their BMW for a Tesla said he regretted it and claimed that some of the techs are really slow and the customer service sucks.",

		"title": "Tesla Cybertruck praised by Joe Rogan ahead of production launch",
		"body": "By\n\nJoe Rogan, the world‚Äôs top podcaster, praised the Tesla Cybertruck‚Äôs design on a recent episode with comedian Jim Breuer.\n\nUndoubtedly, the Tesla Cybertruck‚Äôs defining feature is its unique design and capabilities. Beyond simple performance metrics, consumers have been captivated by Cybertruck‚Äôs striking design language, incredible materials selection, and promised capabilities. Now, those attributes have been recognized by the world‚Äôs top podcaster, Joe Rogan.\n\nJoe Rogan has long been a fan of Tesla and the Cybertruck. The now famous podcast voice has been invited to see and interact with Elon Musk and the truck numerous times before, recently with Jordan Peterson, who also commented on the truck‚Äôs capabilities in a subsequent episode with Rogan. The most recent comments from Joe Rogan come from his conversation with comedian Jim Breuer, focusing on the truck‚Äôs capabilities and Rogan‚Äôs excitement for the upcoming vehicle.\n\nIt should be noted that Rogan‚Äôs comments are NSFW; a synopsis is available below.\n\nDuring his conversation with Breuer, Rogan highlights some key features of the Cybertruck, including its stainless steel body paneling, dynamic suspension system, and overall fantastic design, which he believes will blow many competitors out of the water. Moreover, Rogan believes the Cybertruck‚Äôs offroad abilities and bulletproof paneling will make it a hit with traditional truck buyers.\n\nThe most revealing quote from Rogan‚Äôs comments is regarding how futuristic the truck looks compared to the competition; ‚Äúit looks like its a hundred years in the future‚Ä¶ when you are standing next to it, it is the coolest looking car I have ever seen.‚Äù And looking at the pictures supplied by the podcast host on his Instagram from January last year, it is hard to disagree with him.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Joe Rogan (@joerogan)\n\nSadly, Elon Musk and Tesla have remained secretive about the upcoming truck, despite a wave of recent sightings showing the truck in what is believed to be near production-ready form. Nonetheless, a few specifications and details are known, all likely to captivate customers and make the truck a sales sensation in its first year on the production line.\n\nForemost, the Cybertruck‚Äôs patented stainless steel plating, often compared to the Delorean DMC-12, is set to make the truck easily the most durable on the market, handily crushing its aluminum-based competition, such as the Ford F-150 Lightning and upcoming Chevy Silverado EV. Moreover, with bulletproof glass, and even the ability to forge open water, the truck sounds like it came right off the set of a James Bond movie.\n\nLuckily for long-time reservation holders, the wait is close to over, as the Cybertruck unveiling is planned for Q3 of this year, with deliveries likely beginning shortly thereafter. At that event, Tesla and Elon Musk are expected to reveal pricing information and confirm the specifications of available configurations, including which motor configurations will be entering production later this year.\n\nWhat do you think of the article?

		"title": "EV Sales Expected to Grow in 2023 Despite a Slow Start in Q1, Now ...",
		"body": "BYD Co (HK: 1211 | OTCPK: BYDDF) remains the global sales leader having sold 552,076 new energy vehicles (‚ÄúNEVs‚Äù) in Q1/2023. BYD‚Äôs sales are up 92.81% YoY.\n\nA lot has happened since then, including a ‚Äòprice war‚Äô, where EV car manufacturers are significantly discounting prices to secure growth and market share. Reuters recently reported March China sales stating : ‚ÄúSales of new energy vehicles (NEVs), which include pure battery electric cars and plug-in hybrids, rose 21.9% in March and accounted for 34% of the month‚Äôs sales‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.More than 40 brands have joined a price war started by Tesla this year.‚Äù\n\nGlobal plugin electric car sales in Q1/2023 are estimated to have reached approximately 2.3 million to 2.4 million units (January 662,000 , February 812,000 , March approximately 850,000 (estimate)). At first glance, it may seem like the yearly targets of 13.6 million or 14.3 million look out of reach, but this may not be the case. The first quarter is always the slowest quarter of the year and it was negatively impacted this year by the end of Chinese Federal subsidies and Covid-19 impacts in January in China.\n\nLooking at Auto Shanghai 2023, which is on now in China, it appears that interest in EVs is at an all-time high, with 70 of the 100 new models on display being electric. China continues to dominate global electric car sales, selling almost 60% of global electric cars in 2022.\n\nOverall in Q1/2023, global plugin electric car sales are growing YoY, just not as fast as in 2022. BloombergNEF is forecasting 13.6 million deliveries in 2023, compared to Trend Investing‚Äôs forecast of 14.35 million (up 36% YoY).\n\nAfter a stellar 2022, which saw global plugin electric car sales increase by 55% year on year (‚ÄúYoY‚Äù) to 10.522 million and reach approximately a 13% market share, what will 2023 bring? We already saw a soft start to the year in January, which resulted in a Tesla-led price war. February and March sales of electric cars have seen some improvement.\n\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is at number two globally with 422,875 sales in Q1/2023.\n\nNext in terms of Q1 sales is Volkswagen Group (Xetra: VOW | OTCPK: VWAGY) followed by Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. (HK:0175 | OTCOK: GELYY).\n\nIn terms of the better-known U.S. brands, they are still a very long way behind. For example, General Motors (NYSE: GM) sold 20,670 electric cars in Q1/2023 and Ford (NYSE: F) sold only 10,866. Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) sold 7,946 electric pickup trucks in Q1/2023.\n\nThe Chinese upstarts Li Auto (52,584 sales), Nio (31,041 sales), and XPeng (18,230 sales) performed ok but failed to deliver significant numbers in Q1/2023.\n\nA conclusion from all of the above is that the big are getting bigger, BYD and Tesla dominate, and Volkswagen Group, Geely, and others are all chasing.\n\nImage 2: Tesla has slashed their prices in 2023 ‚Äì Model 3 now sells in the USA for US$39,990, and much less after various incentives\n\nSource: M. Bohlsen\n\n2023 EV trends ‚Äì Price wars and U.S changes to the IRA and the EPA proposed aggressive new ‚Äòclean vehicle‚Äô standards\n\nThe emerging trend of 2023 in a sluggish global economy is an all-out ‚ÄòEV price war‚Äô. Fierce pricing competition has emerged in order to boost sales growth. Falling commodity prices (notably lithium) are helping battery prices to come down and hence also helping EV makers to pass on cost savings.\n\nThe big winner so far in 2023 is the consumer. Tesla ‚Äòslashed prices‚Äò in 2023 thereby starting the price war. You can now buy a Tesla Model 3 RWD in the USA for US$39,990, which drops by the federal tax credit of US$3,750 for eligible buyers (and a further US$2,000 for California eligible buyers). Tesla has the highest auto margins and can afford to cut prices and still remain very profitable (Q1 net GAAP income fell 24% YoY, but remains profitable with 19.3% gross margin).\n\nBYD recently launched their small electric car ‚ÄòSeagul‚Äô at an astonishingly low price (from approximately US$11,400) in China, receiving 10,000 new orders on the first day.\n\nThe incumbent ICE companies and lower volume manufacturers/startups are the ones who will really feel the pinch, with many of them making a loss on their EV sales. At this rate, 2023 may see a few smaller EV startups go bankrupt and potentially some industry consolidation.\n\nAnother key trend in 2023 is the changes to the Inflation Reduction Act (‚ÄúIRA‚Äù). As reported by Bloomberg on April 18, 2023: ‚ÄúOnly 10 electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles will qualify for $7,500 federal tax credits in the US after stricter battery-sourcing rules take effect and render most plug-in models ineligible‚Ä¶‚Ä¶General Motors, Tesla, and Ford Motor all have at least one EV that will qualify, while Ford and Stellantis NV (NYSE: STLA) each have one eligible plug-in hybrid model‚Ä¶.‚Äù\n\nIn a further twist of the knife to the internal combustion engine (‚ÄúICE‚Äù) manufacturers, it was reported in April 2023 that the EPA proposes aggressive new ‚Äòclean vehicle‚Äô standards, stating: ‚ÄúThe agency projects that EVs could account for 67% of new light-duty vehicle sales and 46% of new medium-duty vehicle sales in 2032, bolstered by the EPA proposals.‚Äù\n\nClosing remarks\n\nGlobal electric car sales are off to a sluggish start in 2023, but the recent price war looks to be helping with sales momentum growing in February and March 2023. Tesla appears to be determined to grow EV sales volumes at an average of 50% YoY this decade. Given Q1/2023 growth was 44% YoY, it looks like Tesla will continue the price war for some time.\n\nIn terms of 2023 EV trends, it looks like being a year of reckoning. BYD and Tesla are getting stronger and the ICE laggards and struggling EV startups are being left behind. At this rate, we may see some casualties before year end. At least the EV consumer is now getting some great deals!",

		"title": "Tesla Retail Investors Pitching Money to Advertise for Tesla: Why Are They Doing This?",
		"body": "Tesla Advertising Fund\n\nThere was a poll recently made by Emmett Peppers, one of a large and growing number of retail investors who are concerned that Tesla needs to advertise to clear up misconceptions about the company, inform the public about EVs, and to show that Tesla vehicles are superior to any other vehicles on the road. Here is his latest poll:\n\nIf you are a $TSLA shareholder, would you donate to\n\n‚ÄúFund a Tesla Educational Commercial campaign‚Äù GoFundMe?\n\n(Please retweet so @elonmusk can see results too) ‚Äî Emmet Peppers (@EmmetPeppers) April 24, 2023\n\nIt's interesting to see that after nearly 3,000 votes, numerous people, 43.3%, would never pitch in money to advertise. 35% would pitch in between $1 and $100 or more to help advertise for Tesla. 21.6% aren't sure or don't care.\n\nIn addition to that, Emmet informed me that there are those interested in donating up to $1,000 or more, so it is possible there are many outliers to this data.\n\nThis kind of advertising would be unaffiliated with Tesla. I think this is an interesting idea, because a pool of money from retail investors can be put to work in Google, Facebook, or other online modes of advertising that currently aren't getting utilized. The retail investors, who have a stake in Tesla, can show that it is working or not working based on clicks and interactions with the advertisements.\n\nIt would take someone to \"lead\" this effort and show exactly where the dollars are being spent though to make sure the money being pooled wasn't being taken and not used on the advertising efforts.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nWhy Should Tesla Advertise?\n\nThe three primary reasons for Tesla to get advertising done beyond its Twitter account and Elon Musk are for the following:\n\n* To bring awareness and ease concerns about batteries, range, and charging\n\n* To show how a Tesla is superior in all ways to other EVs and gas cars for the cost\n\n* To clear up misconceptions about things like vehicle fires and safety\n\nI think crowdsourcing this is a great idea, because it allows the concept to be proved or not. If retail investors show that it is working through clicks and interactions, then Elon Musk and Tesla might take it more seriously.\n\nRight now, Tesla is not advertising as it is focusing on cutting costs, which will reduce the prices of its vehicles and make them more affordable. Elon Musk has even said he will bring margins close to 0% if he has to in order to maintain 50% growth each year.\n\nOne Twitter user suggested coming up with a contest and a prize for the top 3 winners of a prototype of a commercial that informs the public about a Tesla EV. I think there would be enough people willing to donate money toward advertising to see how it goes.\n\nWould you donate money to an advertising campaign for Tesla?\n\nIn Related News: Tesla Model Y is Big Savings For Police Departments\n\nLeave your comments below, share the article with friends and tweet it out to your followers.\n\nJeremy Johnson is a Tesla investor and supporter.

		"body": "Chinese battery maker CATL unveiled a new ‚Äòcondensed battery‚Äô at Auto Shanghai 2023. The new battery boasts an energy density of 500Wh/kg, which is outstanding. To give the number a context, Mercedes-Benz‚Äôs EQXX boasts a 100 kWh battery with an energy density of 200Wh/kg, and that EV managed to do as much as 1202 km on a single charge! Now while the EQXX achieves its high range figure with the help of clever aerodynamics, more than doubling its battery density will surely help with range figures by a huge margin.\n\nTo make this high density solid-state battery, CATL concentrated a highly conductive electrolyte, and combined it with an ultra-high energy-dense cathode, among other things. How scalable this battery is, and how it depletes over time are still questions that are left unanswered. And as it goes with new technology, the battery packs could also prove to be very expensive.\n\n\n\nWhile that is said, the implications of the new solid-state battery are far-reaching. Quite simply put, with almost double the energy density of a Tesla Model 3 battery, not only can the EVs go longer on a single charge, they would also require lesser materials to build the batteries. Small sized EVs could still have a small range figure with a tiny battery, making it almost comparable to an ICE counterpart in terms of weight and space in the car. While larger EVs could have huge 200-250 kWh batteries and boast range figures well north of 1000 km, maybe even 1500 km on a single charge. Not just that, since the batteries would actually be light and energy dense, they could even power electric airplanes.\n\n\n\n",

		"title": "Tesla Superchargers -VS- CCS Charging Stations: The Differences",
		"body": "CCS Charging Stations\n\nOut of Spec Reviews is sharing his findings of CCS charging compared to Tesla Supercharging. I also have some of my own experience, I'll share on this.\n\nIn Arizona, there is a distinction being made between charging, which is an issue for the United States and North America - it hasn't caught up to the specs of EVs.\n\nThere is an Electrify America charging station that is being used in Arizona, and he has a Lucid Air which is being charged at this station. This station wasn't very big compared to some of the large Tesla Supercharger stations I've seen.\n\nFor most people who charge at home, it won't matter too much, especially if you never do a road trip - it probably won't matter what kind of car you have. In certain parts of the country, CCS chargers are more numerous or populated.\n\nBuying an EV is currently tied to the charging stations you can use. If there aren't numerous CCS chargers and that's all you have, it makes it difficult to charge. Tesla Superchargers are working to change that with a \"magic dock\" that lets you use a CCS adapter.\n\nOne of the Electrify America chargers was offline, unfortunately, and this is one of the big problems with other charging networks besides Tesla - there are still issues with the charger being down or not working properly.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nTesla Superchargers\n\nTesla charging used to be difficult in the beginning, but have done things to combat the problems. They continue to upgrade their chargers and have made them more reliable.\n\nHaving a Tesla EV is an advantage when using the Supercharger network because you can get real time data on if you can make it to the next charger or not for your road trip. Out of Spec took their Lucid Air to a Tesla Supercharger. There were some slower, 72 kW mobile chargers near the station that they pulled up to.\n\nThere was one Tesla Supercharger that was down, but it was obvious because the lights were off on it. At the Tesla Supercharger location, there were 32 charging stalls for 250 kW. Already, this location is much larger and the majority of the stations are on.\n\nDuring peak travel times, most of these 32 stalls are being used. Tesla has future proofed this location for the next few years by building so many stalls. It also made them in a convenient location next to some stores.\n\nTesla is also going to build an 88 Supercharger stall station near this location as well, in order to be ready for travelers who like to go through this location. Tesla is also, again, using the \"magic dock\" to allow for CCS charging.\n\nTesla is still in the lead with charging, and it's not even close. Most of the time they are faster, more numerous, and more reliable.\n\nFor more information, see this video from Out of Spec Reviews:\n\nIn Related News: Tesla Model Y is Big Savings For Police Departments\n\nLeave your comments below, share the article with friends and tweet it out to your followers.\n\nJeremy Johnson is a Tesla investor and supporter.

		"body": "Inside Automotive\n\nHow Honda dealers are preparing for the future of automotive retailing ‚Äì Bill Feinstein\n\nHonda‚Äôs U.S. Segment is off to a strong start in 2023, with record breaking EV sales and impressive year-over-year growth for the first quarter. But how do things look for dealers on the ground? On this edition of Inside Automotive, host Jim Fitzpatrick is joined by Bill Feinstein, president of Planet Honda in New Hampshire, general manager of Planet Honda in New Jersey and the chairman of the Honda National Dealer Advisory Board. Watch full segment here.\n\nTop Stories\n\nAutoNation, one of the largest dealer groups in the U.S., revealed its business had suffered from ‚Äúmixed economic signals‚Äù during the first quarter, causing profits to fall 20%. The company saw both new and used vehicle sales decline from 2022, even as it continued expanding its market share with new storefronts. Last year, the group‚Äôs long-held position as the nation‚Äôs best-selling dealer came to an end, as its competitor, Lithia Motors, became the first dealer to outsell AutoNation since 1997. Read More\n\nPublic reactions to Tesla‚Äôs quarterly earnings call were quick to arrive, with investors and industry insiders alike critiquing the automaker‚Äôs plans. During the call, CEO Elon Musk told shareholders that this year‚Äôs frequent price cuts were part of a new strategy, which prioritizes volume over profit margins. The brand‚Äôs stock price fell almost 10% the following day, bringing Tesla‚Äôs market cap down by roughly $58 billion. Ford chief, Jim Farley, also weighed in, saying that the discounts were the result of aging products and new competition. The automaker is hoping to recoup its losses through software and autonomous driving services. Read More\n\nNew Jersey has become one of several states to suspend electric vehicle incentives, as sales continue to ramp up faster than expected. The Charge Up New Jersey initiative gave buyers $4,000 for their purchase of an EV, costing the state a total of $35 million since its launch in 2020. On Monday, public utility officials said the plan had run out of funding due to high consumer demand, but promised payments would resume in July. The news comes just over a month after Oregon announced it too would temporarily shut down its incentive program for similar reasons. Read More\n\nAutomotive service revenue hit an all-time high in March, driven by an increase in work order profit margins. Customers paid more for repair and maintenance, allowing earnings to increase despite a slight decline in overall volume. In its monthly service report, Cox Automotive‚Äôs chief economist Jonathan smoke, stated ‚ÄúThe march ticket volume was lower than we have seen in previous years, but higher service costs pushed total service revenue per dealership to a record high for any march in the past five years.‚Äù Read More\n\nFor Dealers\n\nLead the pack: Why emotional intelligence is the key to automotive leadership\n\nEmotional intelligence, also referred to as emotional quotient or simply EQ, is important in any workplace but especially comes in handy at a car dealership‚Äîas any job there requires flexibility, effective communication, and stellar sales etiquette. EQ is especially critical for managers because people in leadership roles must also have critical thinking skills that help them solve problems and adapt to the changes happening with their own staff and the auto industry overall. Read More\n\nIs there a disconnect between your service managers and technicians? Here‚Äôs how to fix it\n\nStrong connections between service department managers and technicians are vital on two fronts: productivity and customer satisfaction. But sometimes poor communication, lack of training, and other factors impact workflow and the fixed ops bottom line. Let‚Äôs explore what causes this friction and how to smooth things over to foster teamwork and camaraderie. While service managers and technicians are on the same team, they really live in two different worlds. This divide comes from distinct job responsibilities. Read More",

There also appeared articles citing Cao as saying that Tesla's pay rise is malicious because it damages the balance of China's labor market.Those articles also \"cited\" Cao as saying that he'd rather donate 10 billion yuan than give pay rise to employees, because high salary would make young people lose the motivation for hard work. Most of those articles are published by independently operated social media accounts.According to Fuyao Group's statement, the company has attached great importance to the well-being of its employees since the company's establishment and has actively shared corporate development achievements with them. For the past 10 years or so, the average annual compound growth rate of per capita salary has remained above 7 percent, the statement said.The company also stressed in the statement that Cao has always been enthusiastic about charity and public welfare, and all donations are made out of his personal assets and has nothing to do the group. Meanwhile, Cao's personal assets must maintain independence from the company in accordance with the law and cannot be used for payment of salaries.Fuyao said that it demands the aforementioned rumor spreaders to remove the false content immediately. It also noted that it reserves the rights to pursue legal action against responsible parties.Fuyao Group's shares dropped by 0.51 percent on the Shanghai stock market on Monday.",

		"body": "By\n\nRepairing Teslas is already a challenging endeavor, but restoring a unit that has been deemed a total loss is a task that‚Äôs on a completely different level. Despite this, a Tesla enthusiast opted to take on such a challenge, and the results were definitely worth it.\n\nElectric vehicle advocate Winston, 18, wanted to build the cheapest Tesla in the United States. To accomplish this, he needed a vehicle that he could acquire for an affordable price. Fortunately, he found just one ‚Äî a red Tesla Model 3 that was deemed a total loss. The EV fan was able to acquire the damaged vehicle from Geico Insurance at an auction for $15,000.\n\nNEW VIDEO ‚Äì This week we are covering @TESLA_winston's rebuild story! Can he build the cheapest Tesla in the US from this totaled Model 3 he purchased from GEICO.https://t.co/gsa7zScpwe\n\n\n\nPlease @Tesla, give Winston the job. pic.twitter.com/bTVtw5kSDs ‚Äî Wham Baam Teslacam (@WhamBaamYT) April 23, 2023\n\nAt $15,000, the totaled Model 3 was definitely cheap. The Tesla tinkerer was even able to retrieve old footage from the vehicle, which showed how the all-electric sedan met its end with its previous owner. The rebuilding process, however, was harder than the 18-year-old expected, as he needed to acquire parts that were rather expensive.\n\nUltimately, Winston was not successful in building the cheapest Tesla in the United States, as the Model 3‚Äôs restoration cost $25,000 in total. But he learned a ton. Thanks to his experience and photographic memory, the 18-year-old informed YouTube channel Wham Baam Teslacam that he could probably rebuild the Model 3 from memory at this point. Needless to say, the Tesla tinkerer‚Äôs next projects would likely be even more affordable.\n\nOverall, the Tesla enthusiast was successful. Being a fan of the longtime YouTube channel Rich Rebuilds, the 18-year-old was able to restore a totaled Tesla at a price far below the vehicle‚Äôs brand-new cost. For now, the Tesla tinkerer is hoping to apply for an internship in the electric vehicle maker‚Äôs service department. Considering his accomplishment, Tesla could likely have a pretty stellar service team member in the 18-year-old.\n\nWatch a video about the Model 3 restoration project in the video below.\n\nDon‚Äôt hesitate to contact us with news tips.

		"body": "One recent Tech graduate‚Äôs success has led him to an internship with Tesla.\n\nAntonio Fern√°ndez Casta√±o came to Tech from San Jose de La Rinconada, Seville, Spain, because of soccer and the mechanical engineering program. He knew he would have a chance to be a student-athlete and continue soccer while getting his engineering degree.\n\n‚ÄúMy main goal was to be able to help people. From a young age, I really liked to mess with things in my house to see how everything works, how to fix things or design new things, that kind of stuff. I knew my path was engineering, specifically mechanical,‚Äù Fern√°ndez explained.\n\nHe was also impressed with the small class sizes at Tech.\n\n‚ÄúI thought it would be better for my learning experience, and it really was,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a really efficient way to learn everything and get to interact with your classmates. It was great.‚Äù\n\nHe took advantage of the small class sizes and the opportunities at Tech. He was president of Pi Tau Sigma, a mechanical engineering honor society, president of the Fluid Power Club, which competed in the National Fluid Power Association National Challenge, member of Tau Beta Pi and member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. All those experiences, he says, helped shape who he was and helped him land his internship.\n\nFern√°ndez graduated in May of 2022. He knew that he wanted to go into the industry but that he also wanted to do research. This led him on a journey to get his master‚Äôs degree at the University of Nevada ‚Äì Reno, where he is currently a graduate research assistant.\n\n‚ÄúAfter graduation, I wanted to further my education to better myself because I want to work in the industry but also wanted to do research. I wanted to know how things worked at a higher level,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI thought it was a great way to get research and work experience.‚Äù\n\nWhile at Tech, he found a mentor who helped him weigh his options when it came to finding a graduate program.\n\n‚ÄúI had a great advisor and mentor, Dr. Panta. He explained to me how graduate school works. I came to him with several options. He told me, your success will be my success, and that‚Äôs something I will always remember,‚Äù he said.\n\nFern√°ndez had several internships and valuable experiences while at Tech, including two in his home country of Spain and one in the United States, where he explored renewable energy, solar panels and clean energy. He hopes to work in the automotive industry and with electric vehicles, so landing an internship at Tesla is a huge opportunity for him. He credits his mentor at WVU Tech and the experiences he had while at Tech to help get him to that point.\n\nTo land a competitive internship at Tesla, he started by just going to a career fair, where Tesla had a booth. He asked the engineers how they liked working there, and what it was like to be in their position.\n\n‚ÄúYou hear Tesla and think oh that‚Äôs super cool, but I wanted to know how it really was working there,‚Äù he said.\n\nWith interest shown and a connection made, the engineers from Tesla sent Fern√°ndez an email a week after to come to the Giga factory in Nevada. They gave him a tour and had a great experience.\n\n‚ÄúI was super excited, and I loved it. It was a process for them to see how involved you are. They get thousands and thousands of applicants, so they wanted to see how much you wanted to be there. Afterward, they had a day where students are invited to go to the factory. They have tables set up and they showcase what they do and what teams they have,‚Äù he explained.\n\nAs he worked his way through the room, he said the engineers and those working for Tesla were impressed when hearing about projects Fern√°ndez had been a part of at Tech. He also brought his CV with him because he said he wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect. This also left an impression on the Tesla team. They told him they were already interested in selecting him as an intern. He had a typical interview for the position and eventually landed the internship.\n\n‚ÄúGet yourself out there and be prepared for anything,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know what to expect that day. Maybe at a career fair you expect to talk to teams of people, but not always.\n\nHe says his advice to Tech grads would be to take chances.\n\n‚ÄúPut yourself out there, get prepared for any opportunities that come,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe main thing really was just putting myself out there. If you don‚Äôt put yourself out there and they (potential employers) don‚Äôt get to know you, you don‚Äôt get a chance.‚Äù\n\nFern√°ndez will start his internship with Tesla next month.\n\nIn addition to his graduate studies, he‚Äôs also a very involved and dedicated alumnus and strives to give back to Tech in any way he can, even though he‚Äôs 2,401 miles away from Beckley. Though he just graduated last May, he‚Äôs signed up for the career mentorship program.\n\n‚ÄúTech really cared about me and I‚Äôm trying to somehow give back with whatever I can help with, make myself available for whoever needs me,‚Äù he explained.\n\nHe had a great mentor and wanted to try to give that opportunity to others - he wants to pay it forward.\n\n‚ÄúIt was a great experience with my classmates, professors, everything. For everyone, going to college is a big change, but even more so if you‚Äôre an international student. You‚Äôre moving away from your family and it‚Äôs tough, you know? People were always there for us though. All my friends had the same feeling ‚Äì we all so appreciated how much people cared about us and made things easier,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúThe community is great. Everywhere you go, there are people that truly care about you. Faculty, career services, student success services, student life ‚Äì everywhere you go there is someone who really cares. That‚Äôs what separates Tech from other schools.‚Äù\n\n",

		"title": "Apple's list of cars that support CarPlay and car key",
		"body": "Over the last several weeks, CarPlay has been in the headlines quite a bit thanks to GM‚Äôs decision to bail on the platform and Rivian‚Äôs continued resistance. Apple, however, isn‚Äôt concerned and has recently updated its website to promote the fact that over 800 cars on the market currently support the feature.\n\nCars with CarPlay\n\nGM announced at the end of March that it will not support CarPlay in any of its future EVs, opting instead to go all-in on a custom system developed on top of Android Automotive. According to GM, it wants to develop new navigation features and subscription revenue opportunities that aren‚Äôt ‚Äúdependent on a person having a cell phone.‚Äù\n\nRivian CEO RJ Scaringe, meanwhile, also defended his company‚Äôs decision to resist CarPlay in favor of its own infotainment system. According to Scaringe, Rivian‚Äôs decision to not use CarPlay is driven by its desire to be the ‚Äúarbiter or head chef‚Äù of the in-car software experience rather than handing over control to a company like Apple.\n\nAnd amid all of that, other companies such as Ford have doubled down on CarPlay and praised it as a way to give customers ‚Äúeasy access and control of their smartphone apps.‚Äù\n\nIn a recent update to its website, Apple (intentionally or unintentionally?) entered the fray on this news cycle. According to its CarPlay website, ‚Äúmore than 800‚Äù car models on the market offer CarPlay support. ‚ÄúMore than 800 models to choose from,‚Äù Apple says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier than ever to find a vehicle that works with CarPlay.‚Äù\n\nApple‚Äôs list includes an in-depth rundown of most every car on the market that offers native CarPlay support. This includes the latest from major carmakers like Ford, Nissan, Honda, and Hyundai. It also includes cars that aren‚Äôt currently available in the United States, such as BYD‚Äôs line of electric vehicles.\n\nThe list is also missing some of the more recent companies that have adopted CarPlay, including Lucid, the luxury electric vehicle maker. Lucid began rolling out both CarPlay and Android Auto last month after it was one of the most highly-requested features from owners.\n\nAs pointed out by MacRumors, Apple‚Äôs webpage touted that ‚Äúover 600‚Äù cars supported CarPlay prior to this update.\n\nCars with car key support\n\nPerhaps more interesting than highlighting CarPlay support, Apple‚Äôs website also touts the cars on the market that offer support for car key. This is Apple‚Äôs platform for storing your car‚Äôs key directly in the Wallet app on your iPhone and Apple Watch. Car key support is still far more limited in availability than CarPlay. Apple highlights options from BYD, BMW, Genesis, Hyundai, and Kia that support car key today.\n\nBMW\n\n2021 ‚Äì 2023 1 Series\n\n2021 ‚Äì 2023 2 Series\n\n2021 ‚Äì 2023 3 Series\n\n2021 ‚Äì 2023 4 Series\n\n2021 ‚Äì 2023 5 Series\n\n2021 ‚Äì 2023 6 Series\n\n2021 ‚Äì 2023 8 Series\n\n2021 ‚Äì 2023 X5\n\n2021 ‚Äì 2023 X6\n\n2021 ‚Äì 2023 X7\n\n2021 ‚Äì 2023 X5 M\n\n2021 ‚Äì 2023 X6 M\n\n2021 ‚Äì 2023 Z4\n\n2022 ‚Äì 2023 i4\n\n2022 ‚Äì 2023 iX\n\n2022 ‚Äì 2023 iX1\n\n2022 ‚Äì 2023 iX3\n\n2023 i3\n\n2023 i7\n\nBYD\n\n2022 ‚Äì 2023 HAN\n\nGenesis\n\n2023 GV60\n\n2023 G90\n\nHyundai\n\n2023 Palisade\n\n2023 IONIQ 6\n\nKia\n\n2023 Telluride\n\n2023 Niro\n\n2024 Seltos\n\nAs first spotted by Nicol√°s √Ålvarez on Twitter, British sports car company Lotus is also working to adopt car key support, though nothing has been officially announced just yet.\n\nThe latest on next-generation CarPlay\n\nOne thing Apple hasn‚Äôt provided an update on, however, is its next-generation CarPlay. First announced at WWDC 2022, next-gen CarPlay is an all-new interface that lets Apple‚Äôs platform take control over the entire in-car experience. This includes support for gauge clusters, climate control, and much more.\n\nApple says that the first cars with support for this next generation of CarPlay will be announced sometime in late 2023. We do, however, know some details on which automakers have signed on to support this new CarPlay interface.\n\nLand Rover\n\nMercedes-Benz\n\nLincoln\n\nAudi\n\nVolvo\n\nHonda\n\nPorsche\n\nNissan\n\nFord\n\nJaguar\n\nAcura\n\nPolestar\n\nInfiniti\n\nRenault\n\nOne thing to remember, however, is that the adoption and implementation details of this new CarPlay are outside of Apple‚Äôs control. Ultimately, it‚Äôll be up to each of these automakers and their respective timelines to roll out the new CarPlay design. And most of those automakers have been quiet on their plans so far.\n\nFollow Chance: Twitter, Instagram, and Mastodon",

		"body": "The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\nOverview\n\nOur mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation, financial and other services related to our products. Additionally, we are increasingly focused on products and services based on artificial intelligence, robotics and automation. In 2023, we produced 440,808 consumer vehicles and delivered 422,875 consumer vehicles through the first quarter. We are currently focused on increasing vehicle production, capacity and delivery capabilities, reducing costs, improving and developing battery technologies, improving our FSD capabilities, increasing the affordability and efficiency of our vehicles, bringing new products to market and expanding our global infrastructure. In 2023, we deployed 3.89 GWh of energy storage products and 67 megawatts of solar energy systems through the first quarter. We are currently focused on ramping production of energy storage products, improving our Solar Roof installation capability and efficiency, and increasing market share of retrofit solar energy systems. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 , we recognized total revenues of $23.33 billion , representing an increase of $4.57 billion , compared to the prior year. We continue to ramp production, build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products and further revenue growth. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 , our net income attributable to common stockholders was $2.51 billion , representing an unfavorable change of $805 million , compared to the prior year. We continue to focus on improving our profitability through production and operational efficiencies. We ended the first quarter of 2023 with $22.40 billion in cash and cash equivalents and investments, representing an increase of $217 million from the end of 2022. Our cash flows provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 2023 and 2022 were $2.51 billion and $4.00 billion , respectively, representing a decrease of $1.48 billion . Capital expenditures amounted to $2.07 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2023 , compared to $1.77 billion during the same period ended March 31, 2022 . Sustained growth has allowed our business to generally fund itself, and we will continue investing in a number of capital-intensive projects in upcoming periods.\n\nManagement Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2023 Outlook\n\nAutomotive-Production\n\nThe following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development, as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q:\n\nProduction Location Vehicle Model(s) Production Status Fremont Factory Model S / Model X Active Model 3 / Model Y Active Gigafactory Shanghai Model 3 / Model Y Active Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg Model Y Active Gigafactory Texas Model Y Active Cybertruck Tooling Gigafactory Nevada Tesla Semi Pilot production TBD Tesla Roadster In development TBD Robotaxi & Others In development We are focused on growing our manufacturing capacity, which includes ramping all of our production vehicles to their installed production capacities as well as increasing production rate, efficiency and capacity at our current factories. The next phase of production growth will depend on the ramp at Gigafactory Berlin -Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas, as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are developing to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease production costs and increase affordability and customer awareness. 23 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- However, these plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by the new product and manufacturing technologies we are introducing, the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we have set ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory.\n\nAutomotive-Demand, Sales, Deliveries and Infrastructure\n\nOur cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles' affordability, and for example, have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles. We will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicles' performance and functionality, including through products based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot and FSD, and other software features, and delivering new vehicles, such as our upcoming Cybertruck. Moreover, we expect to continue to benefit from ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and increasing environmental awareness. However, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to trade and the environment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, increases in interest rates and the liquidity of enterprise customers. For example, inflationary pressures have increased across the markets in which we operate. In an effort to curb this trend, central banks in developed countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, impacting the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements. Further, sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations. Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to adjust and continue to execute well to maintain our momentum. These macroeconomic and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the pricing of, and order rate for our vehicles, and in turn our operating margin. We will continue to adjust accordingly to such developments, and we believe our ongoing cost reduction, including improved production innovation and efficiency at our newest factories and lower logistics costs, and focus on operating leverage will continue to benefit us in relation to our competitors. As our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not become a bottleneck on our total deliveries. We are also committed to reducing the percentage of vehicles delivered in the third month of each quarter, which will help to reduce the cost per vehicle. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will also have to continue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction. In particular, we remain focused on increasing the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations.\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment\n\nThe long-term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes. We continue to increase the production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including the announcement of a new Megafactory in Shanghai . For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones. For Powerwall, better availability and growing grid stability concerns drive higher customer interest. We remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a low-cost and simplified online ordering experience. In addition, we continue to seek to improve our installation capabilities and price efficiencies for Solar Roof. As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and hire additional personnel, particularly skilled electricians, to support the ramp of Solar Roof. 24 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends\n\nOur capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short-term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time, and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions. We are simultaneously ramping new products, ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents, piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies and investing in autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled products, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development, all other continuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to be between $7.00 to $9.00 billion in 2023 and in each of the following two fiscal years. Our business has recently been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also facilitating positive cash generation. We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers. On the other hand, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and rising material prices and increasing supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nFor a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to Part II, Item 7, Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 . There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 .\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSee Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Results of Operations Revenues Three Months Ended March 31, Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 $ % Automotive sales $ 18,878 $ 15,514 $ 3,364 22 % Automotive regulatory credits 521 679 (158 ) (23 )% Automotive leasing 564 668 (104 ) (16 )% Total automotive revenues 19,963 16,861 3,102 18 % Services and other 1,837 1,279 558 44 %\n\nTotal automotive & services and other\n\nsegment revenue 21,800 18,140 3,660 20 % Energy generation and storage segment revenue 1,529 616 913 148 % Total revenues $ 23,329 $ 18,756 $ 4,573 24 % 25\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAutomotive & Services and Other Segment\n\nAutomotive sales revenue increased $3.36 billion , or 22%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 , primarily due to an increase of 108,378 combined Model 3 and Model Y deliveries year over year despite a negative impact from the United States dollar strengthening against other foreign currencies in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the prior period. This was achieved from production ramping of Model Y at Gigafactory Shanghai, Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg, Gigafactory Texas and the Fremont Factory . This increase was partially offset by lower average selling price on our vehicles driven by overall price reductions year over year. There was also a decrease of 2,630 Model S and Model X deliveries year over year. Automotive regulatory credits revenue decreased $158 million , or 23%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 . We recognized $288 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration for credits sold previously, in the absence of which we had an increase in automotive regulatory credits revenue year over year. This increase was primarily due to the increase in volume as well as the regional mix of the credits sold. Automotive leasing revenue decreased $104 million , or 16%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 . The change is primarily due to a decrease in direct sales-type leasing revenue driven by lower deliveries year over year. This was partially offset by an increase from the growing portfolio of our direct operating lease program. Services and other revenue increased $558 million , or 44%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 . The change is primarily due to an increase in used vehicle revenue driven by increases in volume offset by decreases in average selling price of used Tesla and non- Tesla vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow, paid Supercharging revenue, insurance services revenue and retail merchandise revenue.\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\n\nEnergy generation and storage revenue increased $913 million , or 148%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 , primarily due to an increase in deployments of Megapack, higher solar cash and loan deployments at a higher average selling price, as well as increase in deployments of Powerwall at a higher average selling price, year over year.\n\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margin\n\nThree Months Ended March 31, Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 $ % Cost of revenues Automotive sales $ 15,422 $ 10,914 $ 4,508 41 % Automotive leasing 333 408 (75 ) (18 )% Total automotive cost of revenues 15,755 11,322 4,433 39 % Services and other 1,702 1,286 416 32 %\n\nTotal automotive & services and other\n\nsegment cost of revenues 17,457 12,608 4,849 38 % Energy generation and storage segment 1,361 688 673 98 % Total cost of revenues $ 18,818 $ 13,296 $ 5,522 42 % Gross profit total automotive $ 4,208 $ 5,539 Gross margin total automotive 21.1 % 32.9 % Gross profit total automotive & services and other segment $ 4,343 $ 5,532 Gross margin total automotive & services and other segment 19.9 % 30.5 % Gross profit energy generation and storage segment $ 168 $ (72 ) Gross margin energy generation and storage segment 11.0 % (11.7 )% Total gross profit $ 4,511 $ 5,460 Total gross margin 19.3 % 29.1 % 26\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAutomotive & Services and Other Segment\n\nCost of automotive sales revenue increased $4.51 billion , or 41%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 , in line with the growth in deliveries year over year, as discussed above. Further, the average combined cost per unit of our vehicles increased year over year due to increasing prices of raw materials, manufacturing, logistics and warranty costs. These costs were partially offset by manufacturing credits earned as part of the IRA during the three months ended March 31, 2023 . There were also idle capacity charges primarily related to the ramping up of production in Gigafactory Texas and our proprietary battery cells manufacturing during the three months ended March 31, 2023 . We had also incurred costs related to the ramp up of production in Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg during the three months ended March 31, 2022 . These increases in costs of revenue were positively impacted by the United States dollar strengthening against other foreign currencies in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the prior period. Cost of automotive leasing revenue decreased $75 million , or 18%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 , primarily due to a decrease in direct sales-type leasing cost of revenue driven by lower deliveries year over year. This was partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue from the growing portfolio of our direct operating lease program. Cost of services and other revenue increased $416 million , or 32%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 . The change is primarily due to an increase in used vehicle cost of revenue driven by increases in volume offset by a decrease in costs of used Tesla and non- Tesla vehicle sales, an increase in non-warranty maintenance service cost of revenue, and an increase in costs of paid Supercharging, insurance services and retail merchandise. Gross margin for total automotive decreased from 32.9% to 21.1% in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 . This was driven by the changes in automotive sales revenue and cost of automotive sales revenue, as well as a decrease in regulatory credits revenue, as discussed earlier. Gross margin for total automotive & services and other segment decreased from 30.5% to 19.9% in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 , primarily due to the automotive gross margin decrease discussed above, partially offset by an improvement in our services and other gross margin. Additionally, services and other was a higher percentage of the segment gross margin during the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the prior year.\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\n\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue increased $673 million , or 98%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 , primarily due to increase in deployments of Megapack, increase in solar cash and loan deployments at a higher average cost due to increased component costs, as well as increase in deployments of Powerwall. Gross margin for energy generation and storage improved from -11.7% to 11.0% in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 . This was driven by the growth in energy generation and storage revenue and cost of energy generation and storage revenue as discussed above. Additionally, there was a higher proportion of energy storage sales, which operated at a higher gross margin, within the segment. 27 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResearch and Development Expense\n\nThree Months Ended March 31, Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 $ % Research and development $ 771 $ 865 $ (94 ) (11 )% As a percentage of revenues 3 % 5 % Research and development (\"R&D\") expenses decreased $94 million , or 11%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 . The overall decrease was primarily driven by additional costs in the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the current period, as we were in the pre-production phase at Gigafactory Texas and started production at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg only closer to the end of the first quarter of 2022. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 5% to 3% in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 . Our R&D expenses have decreased as a proportion of total revenues despite expanding product roadmap and technologies.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\n\nThree Months Ended March 31, Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 $ %\n\nSelling, general and administrative $ 1,076 $ 992 $ 84\n\n8 % As a percentage of revenues 5 % 5 % Selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses increased $84 million , or 8%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 . This was driven by a $84 million increase in facilities-related expenses and a $49 million increase in employee and labor costs primarily from increased headcount, including professional services. These increases were offset by a decrease of $52 million in stock-based compensation expense, most of which is attributable to the lower stock-based compensation expense of $48 million on the 2018 CEO Performance Award which was fully expensed as of December 31, 2022 . Interest Income Three Months Ended March 31, Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 $ % Interest income $ 213 $ 28 $ 185 661 % Interest income increased $185 million , or 661%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 . This increase was primarily due to higher interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments during the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the prior period. This was driven by an increase in our short-term investments balance and rising interest rates.\n\nOther (Expense) Income, Net\n\nThree Months Ended March 31, Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 $ %\n\nOther (expense) income, net $ (48 ) $ 56 $ (104 ) Not meaningful\n\nOther (expense) income, net, changed unfavorably by $104 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 . The change is primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 28 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProvision for Income Taxes Three Months Ended March 31, Change (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 $ % Provision for income taxes $ 261 $ 346 $ (85 ) (25 )% Effective tax rate 9 % 10 %\n\nOur provision for income taxes decreased by $85 million , or 25%, in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 , primarily due to the change in our pre-tax income year over year.\n\nOur effective tax rate decreased from 10% to 9% in the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 , primarily due to changes in mix of jurisdictional earnings.\n\nSee Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nWe expect to continue to generate net positive operating cash flow as we have done in the last four fiscal years. The cash we generate from our core operations enables us to fund ongoing operations and production, our research and development projects for new products and technologies including our proprietary battery cells, additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities such as the Fremont Factory , Gigafactory Nevada, Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory New York, the ramp of Gigafactory Berlin -Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas, the construction of future factories, and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, Supercharger network, energy product installation capabilities and autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled products. In addition, because a large portion of our future expenditures will be to fund our growth, we expect that if needed we will be able to adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment. For example, if our near-term manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected, including due to global economic or business conditions, we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures. Finally, we continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid growth of our business, including through drawdowns on existing or new debt facilities or financing funds. Conversely, we may also from time to time determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early. Accordingly, we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12-month period following March 31, 2023 , as well as in the long-term.\n\nSee the sections below for more details regarding the material requirements for cash in our business and our sources of liquidity to meet such needs.\n\nMaterial Cash Requirements\n\nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with vendors for the purchase of components and raw materials to be used in the manufacture of our products. However, due to contractual terms, variability in the precise growth curves of our development and production ramps, and opportunities to renegotiate pricing, we generally do not have binding and enforceable purchase orders under such contracts beyond the short-term, and the timing and magnitude of purchase orders beyond such period is difficult to accurately project. As discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in Part I, Item 2, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Management Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2023 Outlook-Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we currently expect our capital expenditures to support our projects globally to be between $7.00 to $9.00 billion in 2023 and in each of the following two fiscal years. We also have certain obligations in connection with our operations at Gigafactory New York and Gigafactory Shanghai, as outlined in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Material Cash Requirements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 . As of March 31, 2023 , we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $1.77 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, of which $939 million is scheduled to become due in the succeeding 12 months. For details regarding our indebtedness, refer to Note 7, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 29 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSources and Conditions of Liquidity\n\nOur sources to fund our material cash requirements are predominantly from our deliveries and servicing of new and used vehicles, sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems, proceeds from debt facilities and proceeds from equity offerings, when applicable. As of March 31, 2023 , we had $16.05 billion and $6.35 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, respectively. Balances held in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $4.26 billion and consisted primarily of Chinese yuan, euros and Canadian dollar. We had $5.16 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities as of March 31, 2023 . Certain of such unused committed amounts are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to draw-down (such as pledging to leased vehicles and our interests in those leases). For details regarding our indebtedness, refer to Note 7, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We continue adapting our strategy to meet our liquidity and risk objectives, such as investing in U.S. government and other investments, to do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers.",

		"body": "SECURITIES & EXCHANGE COMMISSION\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20549\n\nNOTICE OF EXEMPT SOLICITATION (VOLUNTARY SUBMISSION)\n\nNAME OF REGISTRANT: Tesla, Inc.\n\nNAME OF PERSON RELYING ON EXEMPTION: SOC Investment Group\n\nADDRESS OF PERSON RELYING ON EXEMPTION: 1900 L Street, NW, Suite 900, Washington, DC 20036\n\nWritten materials are submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-6(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934:\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nApril 24, 2023 Dear Fellow Tesla Shareholders: We are writing to urge you to vote AGAINST the election of J.B. Straubel to the Tesla Board of Directors (the ‚ÄúBoard‚Äù) on May 16 th . Mr. Straubel has been nominated to replace independent director Hiro Mizuno. While we appreciate the contributions Mr. Straubel made as co-founder and long-time Chief Technology Officer of Tesla, he is clearly a company insider and not an appropriate choice for a Board that already has a dearth of independence. At present, the Board has strong ties to CEO Elon Musk, with his brother, Kimbal Musk, and Ira Ehrenpreis and James Murdoch, who count themselves as his personal friends, serving as directors. Further, Tesla directors receive an extraordinary level of compensation from the company which risks further compromising the Board‚Äôs objectivity and willingness to challenge the CEO. Replacing an independent director with another insider risks exacerbating existing problems that seem to arise from such a clubby Board, including an overcommitted CEO, high CEO and director compensation, a weak pledging policy, an outspoken CEO whose comments are often at the expense of Tesla‚Äôs reputation, and a permissive tone-at-the-top that has allowed a long-simmering ethics crisis to fester. Background We are part of a group of shareholders that is currently engaging Board Chair Robyn Denholm about many of the issues raised in this letter; we have requested dialogue about a comprehensive Board overhaul that replaces the non-independent directors with truly independent directors. While we wait for that engagement to take place, we were alarmed to see the Board moving in the opposite direction with Mr. Straubel‚Äôs nomination in the company‚Äôs most recent proxy statement. Close personal and professional ties undermine the Board‚Äôs independence from CEO Musk. If Mr. Straubel is elected, in our estimation, at least 5 directors of Tesla‚Äôs 8-member Board will be non-independent, bringing the independence level down to a paltry 38%. Musk‚Äôs own brother sits on the Board, and Directors Ehrenpreis and Murdoch have longstanding personal ties to the CEO. In recent court testimony, Murdoch stated that he had attended Kimbal Musk‚Äôs wedding, dined with Kimbal Musk and his wife, and had invested in Space X. Murdoch described his friendship with Elon Musk as going back to at least 2006 and close enough that their families have vacationed together several times. Ehrenpreis was an early investor in Tesla, Space X, and The Boring Company, and recently testified that he has exchanged messages with Elon Musk with effusive notes like ‚Äúlove you man,‚Äù and that he gave the rights to the first Model 3 to Musk as a birthday gift. 1 We also note that there is some indication of a personal relationship between Director Joseph Gebbia, who joined the Board in 2022 and has yet to be elected by shareholders, and Elon Musk. It was widely reported that, in August 2018, Gebbia texted Musk regarding his tweet of plans to take Tesla private at $420 a share, calling it a ‚Äúballer move,‚Äù to which Musk replied, ‚Äúsucks being public.‚Äù 2 Stacking the Board with friends and family creates potential conflicts of interest, which is problematic given the Board‚Äôs responsibility to oversee management and objectively represent the interests of all shareholders. 1 ‚ÄúTesla‚Äôs close-knit leadership team goes under the spotlight in court‚Äù by Matt McFarland; CNN ; November 17, 2022; Found here: www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/business/elon-musk-board-friends/index.html 2 ‚ÄúElon Musk's texts‚Äù TechEmails ; April 24, 2022; Found here: https://www.techemails.com/p/elon-musks-texts ; ‚ÄúTesla Adds Billionaire Airbnb Co-Founder Gebbia to Board‚Äù; Reuters ; April 28,2022;.

Tesla‚Äôs Board is already overly deferential to CEO Musk as has been demonstrated by the complete lack of oversight in allowing Musk to be overcommitted in his business ventures. Currently, he divides his time as CEO of three companies (Tesla, SpaceEx, and Twitter) and as founder at two more (The Boring Company and Neuralink). Moreover, he recently announced that he is launching a third start-up, TruthGPT. While allowing Musk to be a part-time CEO, in 2018, the Board granted him a mega-compensation package that included a 10-year grant of stock options with 12 potential vesting tranches, now valued at up to $56B 3 and causing a significant dilution for shareholders. Shareholders have sued Musk and Tesla's Board, accusing them of breaching their fiduciary duties to the company and its shareholders by granting unjust enrichment to Musk and wasting corporate assets. The Delaware Court of Chancery ruled that Tesla‚Äôs CEO compensation award should be reviewed under ‚Äúheightened judicial suspicion‚Äù due to the conflict of interest between the approval of the pay package and Musk‚Äôs status as a controlling shareholder. 4 Musk‚Äôs compensation award is so massive, that the Economic Policy Institute had to exclude his pay from their most recent report because including his $23.5 billion worth of stock options exercised in 2021 in the sample ‚Äúwould have resulted in an increase of CEO pay in 2021 relative to 2020 of over 300% (the ‚Äòaverage‚Äô for the sample would have been just under $100 million).‚Äù 5 In another sign of management capture, the Board did not step in when Musk reportedly pulled more than 50 employees, mostly software engineers, from Tesla to work at Twitter. Additionally, the Tesla Board has allowed Musk to pledge up to 25% of his Tesla stock as collateral for personal indebtedness, creating clear risks for Tesla shareholders. By contrast, according to Institutional Shareholder Services, over 90% of companies in the S&P 500 have adopted policies prohibiting pledging by company insiders, including outright bans of pledging by executives or directors (68%) or allowing pledging only subject to a waiver granted by the Board (22%). Finally, the Board has failed to rein in Musk‚Äôs taunts intended to provoke the SEC and divisive commentary, both of which pose risks for Tesla. Tesla requires a strong, independent Board to counterbalance CEO Musk‚Äôs behavior. Elon Musk‚Äôs often polarizing and inflammatory statements on Twitter have negative ramifications on Tesla‚Äôs reputation. CEO Musk‚Äôs decision to wade into deeply divisive narratives and promote conspiracy theories risks alienating Tesla's consumer base. According to two brand image firms, Tesla‚Äôs brand has significantly fallen. Last year, market research firm YouGov reported that for the first time the majority of survey respondents reported a negative view of Tesla‚Äôs brand. Since January 2020, YouGov‚Äôs brand reputation surveys have found that each major U.S. auto company has scored higher than Tesla. Surveys conducted by Morning Consult also revealed declining consumer sentiment for the Tesla brand.

After a meteoric rise during the COVID pandemic, Tesla‚Äôs share price has fallen 55% since November 2021. While it can be hard to attribute share price declines to any particular cause, many analysts and reporters have cited supply chain issues, the shutdown of Tesla‚Äôs factory in China, and several quarters of vehicle deliveries falling below expectations as explanations for this decline. Other commentators have suggested that Tesla shareholders have been concerned that Musk‚Äôs acquisition of Twitter may be distracting him from his responsibilities at Tesla, and further pointed to his having sold a substantial number of Tesla shares in order to finance that acquisition. 7 In 2021, when Musk tweeted out a poll asking his followers if he should sell 10% of his interest in Tesla, shares fell as much as 7.3%. Shares also fell by 3% when Musk tweeted that there may be doubt in Hertz‚Äôs ability to purchase 100,000 Teslas as part of a previously announced arrangement. An independent board of directors is critical to managing these fluctuations that make Tesla‚Äôs performance appear to be at the whim of Musk. Tesla also suffers from a poor tone at the top which has created material legal risk for the company. For over a decade, accusations have surfaced of a toxic work environment at the Fremont factory. Elon Musk‚Äôs email following a 2017 class action lawsuit alleging racial discrimination and harassment telling employees that ‚Äúif someone is a jerk to you, but sincerely apologizes, it is important to be thick-skinned and accept that apology‚Äù 8 serves as an egregious example of setting a permissive tone by putting the weight of the transgression on the victim and signaling to the perpetrator that the misbehavior is fine as long as you apologize. Meanwhile, the problem has only festered. In 2022, the California Department of Fair Housing and Employment filed suit against Tesla after a 32-month investigation concluded that Black employees faced a hostile environment at the factory. Allegations include severe harassment wherein Black workers endure racist jokes and name-calling, swastikas and other racial epitaphs left on walls, and part of the factory being referred to as the plantation or slave ship. Last summer, a class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of at least 15 Tesla current and former employees alleging the same issues at the same plant. In another example, at least 7 women have filed suit against Tesla alleging sexual harassment since 2021. Last year, the CEO himself faced sexual harassment allegations at SpaceEx and tweeted ‚ÄúFinally, we get to use Elongate as scandal name. It‚Äôs kinda perfect,‚Äù with the laugh-cry emoji. 9 These examples of Musk making light of discrimination and harassment accusations, set a permissive tone throughout the company allowing hostile work environments to thrive and creating material risk for Tesla, all of which have taken place under the oversight of a questionably independent Board. 6 ‚ÄúElon Musk‚Äôs Twitter Politics Add to Pressure on Tesla‚Äôs Brand Image‚Äù by Patrick Coffee and Rebecca Elliot; Wall Street Journal ; November 29, 2022; Found here: https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-twitter-politics-add-to-pressure-on-teslas-brand-image-11669764014?mod=e2tw 7 ‚ÄúElon Musk Sells Another $3.6 Billion In Tesla Stock To Prop Up Twitter‚Äù by Contributor; December 29, 2022.

Tesla directors receive extraordinary compensation, many times larger than what directors earn at other large companies, enabling them to amass fortunes over the years. This level of compensation risks discouraging directors from ‚Äúrocking the boat,‚Äù especially considering the heavy influence Musk‚Äôs large equity stake in Tesla has in director elections. According to an examination of security filings by the New York Times in late 2022, Board Chair Denholm‚Äôs compensation, composed almost entirely of stock options, was $5.8 million in 2020, and she has earned $280 million since 2020 from the sale of Tesla shares awarded to her as compensation. The same analysis found that Murdoch received $11 million, mostly in stock options, since becoming a Tesla director in 2017, and estimated his stake in the company to be $200 million based on company securities filings. Adding Straubel to the Board is a step in the wrong direction. Newly nominated J.B. Straubel has longstanding ties to Tesla and Elon Musk. They both joined Tesla early on and consider themselves co-founders. Straubel served under Musk as Tesla‚Äôs Chief Technology Officer for 14 years. After resigning in 2019, he remained on as a ‚ÄúSenior Advisor‚Äù according to company disclosures. We note that it is unclear when he left this role, but presumably it was prior to May 2020 since Tesla asserts in its proxy statement that he is ‚Äúindependent‚Äù by NASDAQ standards. An excerpt from the recent derivative complaint filed as part of a lawsuit over Elon Musk‚Äôs 2018 compensation plan raises serious concerns about Musk and Straubel‚Äôs relationship with the Board: On May 12, 2017, with discussions regarding the 2018 Grant ongoing, Tesla co-founder J.B. Straubel emailed E. Musk regarding ‚ÄúEquity Incentives,‚Äù and requested that E. Musk ‚Äúconsider giving [Straubel] the same vesting milestones that [E. Musk] and the board set up for [E. Musk] and tie to that some smaller percentage of the equity awards when they are achieved.‚Äù E. Muhk responded that he was ‚Äúplanning on something really crazy, but also high risk‚Äù vis-√†-vis his new compensation plan. 10 At the time, both Musk and Straubel were Named Executive Officers. In order to be effective, the Tesla Board requires strong directors who have a proven ability to stand up to domineering founder-CEOs. Unfortunately, this does not seem to be Straubel‚Äôs strong suit. In an article with Time Magazine last year, Straubel responded to a question about his relationship with Musk: ‚ÄúSome of this stuff is a lightning rod of controversy that I just do not want to wade into, frankly‚ÄîI‚Äôm tiptoeing around how we even talk about this stuff. I know people are fascinated by [my relationship with Elon], but there‚Äôs no real benefit in trying to thread the needle on this. Y ou‚Äôll risk finding a way to piss him off on something that you say, probably unintentionally, and then have him more frustrated at you, or who knows what.‚Äù 11 Adding another insider who is likely to be acquiescent to CEO Musk will only serve to further dilute an already weak Board. Conclusion Tesla‚Äôs Board already suffers from a dearth of independent directors. This lack of board independence has resulted in poor oversight of the company‚Äôs overly influential and mercurial CEO, which in turn has 10 Richard Tornetta v.

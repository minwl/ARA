Subscribe\n\nWednesday, April 26, 2023\n\nApple's universe is expanding\n\nApple’s (AAPL) business model is largely based on ensuring you stay an iPhone user. Whether that’s by introducing new hardware accessories like its AirPods and Apple Watch, services like iCloud, or platforms like Apple Fitness+, everything is designed to keep you coming back to the iPhone.\n\nBut the introduction of its new high-yield savings account last week goes a step beyond hardware and software offerings. Apple is now keeping customers glued to its side by serving as their bank.\n\n“If you got your money at Apple Bank and that savings account, the probability that you buy an iPhone, just renew and maintain your ownership of iPhone, goes up,” Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.\n\nAnd that’s exactly what Apple, and its investors, wants.\n\nKeeping you hooked\n\nApple’s savings account, which is available to Apple Card holders and administered by Goldman Sachs (GS), is an especially tempting offering for customers thanks to its 4.15% annual yield. Apple says that’s more than 10 times the national average. In other words, you’re not going to get that kind of rate through your standard savings account.\n\nWhat’s more, adding money to your Apple savings account is relatively simple. You connect your existing bank account to your Apple savings account and start moving money over. Daily Cash, the money you earn on purchases through your Apple card, is also automatically deposited into your savings account.\n\n“You can just see how this is going to play out. It started out with payments at point of sale and they added it to web, went peer to peer…Then they added the Apple Card and now savings which is driving adoption of Apple Card. And eventually they'll have checking,” Munster said.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, center, greets people during the opening of the first Apple Inc. flagship store in Mumbai, India, Tuesday, April 18, 2023.

(AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool)\n\n“It's a beautiful model for them. They just keep building on top of each other.”\n\nIt’s not just the Apple savings account or Apple Card that are tethering customers’ financials to the company. In March, Apple announced the U.S. availability of its Apple Pay Later offering. The buy-now pay-later service, which allows users to apply for loans of between $50 and $1,000, splits purchases across four payments over six weeks with no interest or fees.\n\nAnother piece to power growth\n\nApple’s savings account isn’t likely to become a breadwinner for the company — and might not make much of a dent in its revenue numbers at all. But the service, along with the firm’s broader push into health coverage, which Bloomberg reports will include mood tracking and an AI-powered coach, along with its upcoming AR/VR headset, are all a means of helping power growth piece by piece.\n\n“This is all part of Apple’s consumer flywheel, which continues to grow around health and banking,” Wedbush senior equity analyst Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance. “The health vertical is a key focus for Cupertino and this new initiative is a smart move that could further ramp growth in this key arena.”\n\nFor Apple, it’s all about adding more pieces. And getting you hooked on them.\n\nBy Daniel Howley, tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

Developers reportedly confirmed the removal of the nine-page PDF that outlines the design of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency after the third beta for macOS 13.4 Ventura was released on Tuesday.\n\nA spokesperson for Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Brandon Butch, a popular social media personality who reviews and explores Apple products, confirmed to Fortune that the white paper was removed when he accessed the beta.\n\nPreviously, the PDF was accessible on any post-2018 Mac operating system, according to Baio. “I’ve asked over a dozen Mac-using friends to confirm, and it was there for every one of them,” he wrote in a blog post detailing his discovery. He stumbled upon the white paper, authored by Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious and anonymous founder of Bitcoin, when he was trying to scan documents from a combination printer-scanner onto his computer.\n\nBaio wrote a quick command in Terminal, the application that enables users to explore a Mac’s file system through text commands, to pull up the white paper. The paper is also accessible through Finder, the Mac’s file management system. Fortune was able to independently confirm its location on a recently released MacBook Pro.\n\nWhile it’s unclear why Apple removed the white paper, which some crypto enthusiasts see as a quasi-religious screed, Baio has previously speculated to Fortune that its inclusion on Mac’s operating systems was the work of one engineer.\n\nStory continues\n\n“In its early history, Apple developers used to hide Easter eggs in the operating system,” he previously told Fortune. “But I get the impression this wasn’t something that management would have approved of—basically the decision of a single engineer.”\n\nAn anonymous source told Baio that someone at Apple flagged the existence of Nakamoto’s manifesto on Mac’s operating systems, but that the same engineer who had allegedly placed it was assigned with its removal.\n\nWith its reported removal from the most recent beta for Mac’s operating system, perhaps the media storm that accompanied the white paper’s discovery finally moved Apple’s higher-ups to delete it from all Macs.\n\nUpdate, April 26, 2023: This article has been updated with confirmation from Brandon Butch that the Bitcoin white paper was not on the Mac operating system’s most recent beta when he accessed it.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nMore from Fortune:\n\n5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home\n\nLooking to make extra cash?

The source said a developer work ticket had been submitted to remove the paper, and was assigned to the same person who put the white paper in the software system.\n\nThe paper, titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\" is widely regarded as bitcoin's founding document, laying out the working mechanisms that enable the digital token to act as a currency.\n\nBaio helped the white paper go viral earlier this month after he accidentally discovered the PDF, which appeared to have been shipped with every Apple computer since 2018.\n\n\"Of all the documents in the world, why was the Bitcoin whitepaper chosen? Is there a secret Bitcoin maxi working at Apple?\" Baio said in a blog post at the time. \"Maybe it was just a convenient, lightweight multipage PDf for testing purposes, never meant to be seen by end users.\"\n\nThe paper's discovery led to theories that Apple's late co-founder Steve Jobs could have been Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of bitcoin that withdrew their presence from the internet in late 2010, around the same time Jobs passed away. But there's no way Jobs himself placed the paper in the system, observers say, as the Apple co-founder died in 2011, seven years before the paper first appeared on Apple computers.\n\nBitcoin rose to $29,772 on Wednesday. Despite tanking in 2022 amid rising interest rates, the cryptocurrency has rebounded nearly 80% since the start of the year.\n\nCurious Mac users can enter the following prompt into the terminal program to load the PDF of the white paper:"

Counterpoint and Canalys estimates, which look at sales and shipments, handed Apple the narrow lead. The US electronics firm clinched the top spot in the final three months of last year following the release of its iPhone 14 and 14 Pro series.\n\nThe Chinese smartphone market registered double-digit contractions for most of the past year, first with steep drops in sales of Android handsets, such as those made by Oppo, and eventually impacting even Apple’s iPhone range. Shipments to mainland China declined 11% in the first quarter relative to the prior year, to the lowest first-quarter levels in a decade, Canalys said.\n\nPrice cuts of iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max models helped in February, IDC said, though the introduction of a new yellow iPhone 14 handset failed to stir major excitement. Apple debuted the new color option in early March hoping to keep buyers interested in the pricey device, which costs at least 5,999 yuan ($870) in China.\n\nOppo managed to sell more premium devices than expected in the past quarter, according to IDC. It got a boost from its sub-brand OnePlus returning to the domestic market, along with a positive reception to its foldable devices. Samsung Electronics Co., the global leader in smartphones and foldables, has only a small presence in China, where every local phone maker now has at least one foldable model on sale.\n\nStory continues\n\nNone of the top five biggest vendors in China recorded positive growth. Vivo, Honor Mobile and Xiaomi Corp. rounded out the leading brands, each with significant declines on the year-ago period.\n\nRead more: Drop in China’s Chip, Tech Output Casts Shadow on GDP Recovery\n\nSmartphone production is down 13.8% in the world’s second largest economy this year despite a rebound in the overall economy, official data showed.\n\n“The pandemic affected consumer behavior in the medium to long term, where consumers tended to spend their income on necessities and maintain certain savings,” Canalys analyst Lucas Zhong said in a report on Thursday. “Vendors need to offer convincing products to stimulate upgrades.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n©2023 Bloomberg L.P."

It is also working on ways that would let the iPhone track emotions, and an iPad version of the Health app.\n\nThe coach would use artificial intelligence to encourage people to exercise and eat and sleep better. It would take data from a user’s Apple Watch, crunch it using AI, and then provide new coaching programmes to help them improve.\n\nApple already offers its Fitness+, which charges a monthly fee for access to workouts and classes. But that is not personalised and it focuses only on exercise.\n\nThe work brings together Apple’s Health, Siri and AI teams, the report noted. It is expected to arrive next year, but could be postponed or cancelled entirely.\n\nThe emotion tracking features are expected to arrive earlier, potentially at Apple’s WWDC event this summer. Users will be able to answer questions about their wellbeing and track them over time in the Health app.\n\nOther services, such as Whoop, offer similar tools. And Apple already allows users to track a wide array of data about themselves, but that is limited to physical measures at the moment.\n\nApple has been rumoured to be working on features to help track mental wellbeing and spot the signs of conditions such as depression and cognitive decline for some time. In 2021, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was looking to use sensors to monitor data such as mobility, physical activity, sleep patterns, typing behaviour and other information – and use that to better understand its users.\n\nAs well as marking a change from a focus on physical wellbeing, the new features would also be unusual in that they were based around the iPhone rather than the Apple Watch, the WSJ report noted. The company has been looking at ways of integrating health features into the iPhone as well as the Watch, it said then.\n\nApple is also expected to bring the new iPad version of the Health app this summer."

He remembered thinking at the time that Apple was probably making a $200 profit on each music player it sold, and the company had a solid balance sheet.\n\n\"I should have done some work on Apple,\" Lynch said, noting it wasn't a complicated business and the iPod paved the way for the iPhone.\n\nBerkshire plowed about $36 billion into Apple between 2016 and 2018. The stock has more than tripled since then, boosting the value of its stake to about $150 billion.\n\nBuffett's company ranks among Apple's biggest shareholders with a roughly 5.8% stake. It also counts Apple as easily the most-valuable holding in its $300 billion stock portfolio.\n\nThe Berkshire chief has labeled Apple a\"family jewel\" and \"probably the best business\" he's come across, and praised CEO Tim Cook as one of the best managers in history. He's also noted that he doesn't understand all the technical elements of Apple devices, but he recognizes how desirable and indispensable they are to customers.\n\n\"We'll never own a business that makes so many people happier and is so useful for them,\" Buffett said recently, adding that most Apple fans would turn down a $10,000 offer to give up their iPhone and never buy another one.\n\nAlong with Apple, Lynch said he regretted not taking a closer look at Nvidia. Shares in the graphics-chips giant have more than quadrupled in price since the start of 2020.\n\nThe veteran investor also complained that many people do more research before they buy a refrigerator or a plane ticket than before they make a $10,000 investment. He urged them to understand what a company does before buying its shares.\n\nSeparately, Lynch predicted more banks will fail if a financial crisis takes hold, and disclosed that he doesn't own any cryptocurrencies."

		"content": "(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. posted a record $3.4 billion loss at its pivotal memory chip division, but said it expects the global tech industry to begin emerging from its downturn later this year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIt joined SK Hynix Inc. in predicting some relief from a broad tech recession that’s hit the world’s biggest names from Apple Inc. to Intel Corp. Asia’s largest electronics company said Thursday it expects demand to only gradually improve in a range of markets from smartphones to PCs and storage, driven by a Chinese economic recovery and accelerating AI development.\n\nSamsung has been at the heart of a slump gripping the $160 billion global memory industry, a proxy for a wider downturn that set in after a Covid-era boom in internet activity and device sales. Inflation and recession fears last year triggered a rapid pullback on consumer and business spending that’s since hammered sales of electronics worldwide.\n\nThe company, which supplies chips to Apple while making the iPhone’s closest competitor, reported net income of 1.4 trillion won ($1.05 billion), lagging the 1.45 trillion won average analyst estimate. Its semiconductor division, typically its largest, posted an unprecedented loss of 4.58 trillion won. Its shares were largely unchanged in Seoul trading.\n\n“The memory chip industry has likely passed the worst of weak demand” in the first quarter, Eli Lee, head of investment strategy at Bank of Singapore. “Higher-end memory sales will continue to support pockets of demand, especially in 2H23 due to new smartphone launches and AI demand expansion.”\n\nSamsung plans to maintain 2023 investment in memory chips at about last year’s level, because it’s seeking to safeguard its longer-term competitiveness. That’s despite promising a “meaningful” cut in semiconductor production, a reduction aimed at stabilizing collapsing chip prices. The Korean company has historically aimed to spend throughout recessions to protect its lead.\n\nStory continues\n\nClick here for a liveblog covering the earnings release.\n\nThe unusual move, twinned with more upbeat predictions about PC and phone demand, had spurred hopes that the industry will climb out of its trough this year. Spot memory prices rebounded for the first time in 13 months shortly after Samsung’s announcement.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hynix added to that sentiment after reporting a drop in revenue that was not as bad as feared and saying it sees memory prices bottoming out in the current quarter. Micron Technology Inc., the largest US maker of memory chips, had already said client inventories were declining.\n\nSamsung posted its slimmest operating profit since 2009 just a few weeks ago. Any sustained recovery may now hinge on an economic rebound in China, the world’s largest market for PCs and smartphones. That recovery has been uneven but is gaining steam.\n\n“In the second half, the smartphone market is expected to increase in both volume and value amid signs of a global economic recovery,” it said in its statement.\n\nSamsung managed to stay in the black during the March quarter in part because its new Galaxy S23 phone series bucked the overall smartphone slump. The mobile division posted a 3.9 trillion won operating profit in the quarter.\n\nLonger term, investors remain transfixed on how a US-China conflict might affect the industry. Beijing launched a review of chips from Micron in March, inciting concerns about a backlash toward American companies and possibly US allies. China is among Korea’s largest export destinations, and a key market as well as a production base for Samsung and Hynix.\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is touring the US capital this week and discussions are likely to center on Korea’s role in US curbs on exports to China, part of Washington’s effort to contain its political rival. A blockade on shipments of chipmaking equipment threatens to curtail Samsung’s memory operations in China.\n\nExecutives said Thursday they’re negotiating with Washington about guardrails in the CHIPs and Science Act, which constrain companies that take federal funds from certain expansions in China.\n\n“The US will collect opinions and feedback from the industry and also carry out negotiations with individual companies,” said Ben Suh, head of investor relations. We “are studying various possibilities and scenarios and will continue to work on minimizing the geopolitical risks to our business.”\n\n--With assistance from Vlad Savov, Min Jeong Lee, Debby Wu, Gao Yuan and Youkyung Lee.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n©2023 Bloomberg L.P."

		"content": "In this piece, we will take a look at ten overlooked large-cap stocks with cheap multiples. For more stocks, head on over to 5 Overlooked Large-Cap Stocks with Cheap Multiples.\n\nIn business as well as in the stock market, a time test principle holds true - the bigger you get, the more attention comes your way. For the stock market, this is clear when we see media coverage of different stock companies. The largest companies in the world in terms of market capitalization, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) get the most coverage, while other names see less attention. Yet, even though big tech, referred to as a 'monopoly' consists of a handful of companies, the mega cap segment to which these firms belong has a lot more companies than that. Mega cap refers to firms that have a market capitalization greater than $200 billion, and data from the stock screener Stock Analysis shows that right now there are 39 such firms, with Apple being the largest with a $2.6 trillion market capitalization and the smallest being Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) which has a $208 billion market capitalization.\n\nYet, as we move down the market capitalization food chain and focus our attention on large cap stocks (those with market capitalization between $10 billion and $200 billion), the number of firms naturally grows. There are 726 large cap companies, out of which NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is the biggest since it has a $194 billion market capitalization and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited (NYSE:RDY) is the smallest with a market value of just a hairline above $10 billion. However, the small cap segment has the highest number of stocks, with more than a thousand companies on the list.\n\nWith these countless firms, investing is nothing less than an art. These days, the hottest topic in the financial press is a recession. As counterintuitive as it may sound, a potential recession is actually the result of the decisions of the Federal Reserve. This is because the central bank is worried about high inflation in U.S. becoming permanent, and to achieve its objectives, it has rapidly been increasing interest rates. On the inflation front, fresh data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released in mid April 2023 show that 'some' inflation had down. To understand what this means, you have to understand that there are two kinds of inflation. These are the core and non core inflation, with the former removing food and energy from the mix to evaluate the prices of consumer goods, and the latter being a broader metric of inflation as a whole. The Labor Department's data revealed that the broader inflation, or the consumer price index (CPI), had grown by 5% annually in March 2023, for a full percentage point drop from February's figures. In monthly terms, the CPI stood at a mere 0.1%, below economist forecasts of 0.2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the core inflation component sat at 5.6% during March 2023, for a ten basis point (0.1%) jump from the annual February reading of February 2023. The monthly core reading dropped to 0.4% from the previous month's 0.5% indicating that downward price trends are in play. A key component of the core CPI is rent, and their growth continued to push inflation higher.\n\nThe divergence between the core and non core inflation readings has led to a broad consensus that the Fed will increase interest rates one more time in May 2023 by 25 basis points before pausing. At the same time, most analysts also believe that a recession is due in America later this year, mirroring sentiment echoed by investment banks as 2023 started to settle in. So, in a recession, which stocks perform well? On this front, Schroders has some research, which shows that capital flows away from small cap stocks into large cap stocks as a recession starts to kick in since investors become wary of the stock market's health. However, as the small cap share prices drop, capital flows back into them once a recession has settled in. Broadly speaking, during a recession and recovery, small cap stocks give 9.9% in annualized returns and large caps return 4.9%. However, during the expansion and slowdown phases, large caps end up returning 8.5% while small caps return 5.5%.\n\nFinally, the Fed's latest Monetary Policy Committee and Board of Governors meeting held in late March 2023 provides additional insights into how long a recession can last. The meeting's minutes share:\n\nFor some time, the forecast for the U.S. economy prepared by the staff had featured subdued real GDP growth for this year and some softening in the labor market. Given their assessment of the potential eco- nomic effects of the recent banking-sector developments, the staff’s projection at the time of the March meeting included a mild recession starting later this year, with a recovery over the subsequent two years. Real GDP growth in 2024 was projected to remain below the staff’s estimate of potential output growth, and then GDP growth in 2025 was expected to be above that of potential. Resource utilization in both product and labor markets was forecast to be much less tight than in the January projection. The level of real output was projected to move below the staff’s estimate of potential output in early 2024, more than a year sooner than in the previous projection. Likewise, the unemployment rate was projected to rise above the staff’s estimate of its natural rate early next year.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some large cap stocks that are cheap and do not see significant hedge fund interest. Some top picks are U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL), MPLX LP (NYSE:MPLX), and Western Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE:WES).\n\n10 Overlooked Large-Cap Stocks with Cheap Multiples\n\nCopyright: wrangel / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo pick out overlooked large cap stocks, we first listed down all companies with a market capitalization that ranges between $10 billion and $200 billion. Then, we narrowed them down to those companies that have a price to earnings (P/E) ratio lower than 10. A P/E ratio is a common measure of a stock's 'cheapness' since the share price is more in tune with the firm's profits. Finally, these firms were ranked according to hedge fund sentiment courtesy of Insider Monkey's fourth quarter of 2022 survey of 943 hedge funds. Out of these, the ten with the least number of hedge fund investors were picked as part of our list of cheap and overlooked large cap stocks.\n\n10 Overlooked Large-Cap Stocks with Cheap Multiples\n\n10.

If the gains hold, the company will add $151 billion in market value, the most in the company’s history, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nWith tech companies rapidly growing in market value, even relatively small rallies have led to huge gains. Last year, both Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. added more than $190 billion in market value in single sessions, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe software giant is poised to scale to a market capitalization of $2.2 trillion, helping it reclaim the title of the world’s second most valuable public company. Microsoft would catapult over oil giant Saudi Aramco’s $2.1 trillion value. Apple remains the largest company with a value of $2.6 trillion through Tuesday’s close.\n\nMicrosoft results, along with Alphabet Inc. earnings, that beat expectations helped ease concerns that this year’s rally in technology stocks could be overdone. Microsoft’s Azure cloud-computing business saw revenue expand 31% excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, matching the average analyst projection.\n\nFollowing the results, both Macquarie Research and BMO Capital Markets upgraded Microsoft to an outperform, bringing the tally of analysts with buy-equivalent recommendations to 54.\n\nBMO’s Keith Bachman said in a note that the upgrade reflects their “higher conviction that Azure growth headwinds will moderate” by the end of the year and “AI can help support longer-term growth.”\n\nStory continues\n\n“While the stock is not inexpensive, we think the durable growth opportunities warrant a premium valuation,” he wrote.\n\nShares of Microsoft briefly pared gains in premarket trading Wednesday after Britain’s antitrust watchdog blocked the company’s $69 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard Inc., saying it would harm competition on the cloud.\n\nMicrosoft said it remains committed to the acquisition and plans to appeal the decision.\n\n--With assistance from Tom Contiliano.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n©2023 Bloomberg L.P."

He also returned the phone free of charge, FOX TV reported.\n\nSiggelkow said he was not quite sure how Brookins unlocked the phone, other than to guess his passcode was a series of ‘1s.’\n\nStory continues\n\nTo this day, Siggelkow said, the phone works perfectly fine. Maybe next time, he noted, he will remember that mother knows best.\n\nApple claims the latest smartphones can survive up to 6 meters underwater for 30 minutes.\n\nIf a phone ever becomes web, Apple has several tips on its website on how to revive the device."

		"content": "Economic Concerns Remain Despite Market Recovery\n\nThough equities markets have recovered thus far in 2023, many economic and macro concerns remain. Geopolitically speaking, the war in Ukraine persists with no end in sight (and potential escalations elsewhere, like Taiwan). Inflation has slowed; however, there are some signs that it may rear its ugly head again. Used car prices, which are often looked at as a leading indicator for inflation, began moving up again in March for the first time in seven months.\n\nUnforeseen Rate Hiking Problems\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve’s rate-hiking crusade against inflation has caused unanticipated problems in the regional banking sector. The SPDR Regional Bank ETF (KRE) has been under immense pressure. Silicon Valley Bank has already gone bust, and fellow regional bank First Republic Bank (FRC) is on the tipping point – down more than 90% year-to-date, with the deposits dropping rapidly.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTechnology is the Leader but is Extended\n\nConversely, technology and the Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ) have been on a tear. Mega-cap tech stocks such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA) have been on a tear. So far this year, NVDA is up a mind-blowing 85%!\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThat said, many stocks, such as Apple and Microsoft, have yet to tag their 50-day moving averages since breaking out earlier in the year.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe 50-day tends to act similar to a rubber band. When stocks get stretched too far in one direction, they tend to snap back in the other direction. Couple that with the fact that we are heading into the historically weak period of May, and investors overleveraged in tech stocks may be in for some pain. In pre-election years, like the one we are in now, May tends to be the second weakest month of the year.\n\nWhere to Hide?\n\nLike anything in the stock market, a tech pullback is not a foregone conclusion. However, investors will be best served to diversify their portfolios so that they can withstand any potential volatility in the market. Due to the regional banking crisis, many banking and small cap stocks are vulnerable. Meanwhile, investors likely do not want to chase tech here.\n\nStory continues\n\nAn Essential Sector\n\nOne intriguing avenue to take is to look at the healthcare sector. The most basic needs of human beings are food, water, shelter, and healthcare. Healthcare is a sector that has stood the test of time and will undoubtedly continue to into the future. Below are some reasons healthcare companies tend to do well in any economy:\n\nHealthcare is a necessity: As I mentioned above, healthcare is a non-negotiable. If you are sick, you will seek healthcare.\n\nDefensive sector: Because healthcare is a necessity, savvy investors understand they can rely on healthcare stocks for steady and stable growth. Unlike other sectors, healthcare stocks will fluctuate less based on the overall economy.\n\nAn Aging Population: As the “baby boomer” generation ages, demand for healthcare services will inevitably increase, leading to a surge in healthcare expenditures.\n\nStocks to Watch\n\nMerck (MRK) has one of the deepest pipelines in the biotech space. The company boasts more than six blockbuster drugs, including Keytruda, which is approved for treating several types of cancer. Through its in-house pipeline and strategic acquisitions over the years, the company has one of the best growth track records of any company in the market, let alone the healthcare sector. Below is a chart of the company’s EPS growth going back to the 90s.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBeyond its impressive pipeline and earnings track record, MRK has an immaculate balance sheet. The company has over $13 billion in cash on hand and only $1.9 billion in short-term debt. MRK will report earnings Thursday.\n\nDexCom (DXCM) develops continuous glucose monitoring systems for diabetes patients. As the number of diabetes patients in the United States and around the world continues to grow, DXCM should be a primary beneficiary. DXCM is setting up in an attractive price pattern and is attempting to break out ahead of its earnings report on Thursday.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShockwave Medical (SWAV) is a medical device company that develops products for patients with cardiovascular disease. SWAV is one of the fastest-growing companies in the healthcare space. Last quarter, SWAV grew year-over-year EPS 232% on revenue growth of 71%.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOther healthcare stocks, such as Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Medtronics (MDT), and Stryker (SYK), are also very strong – illustrating the immense investor appetite for this sector currently.\n\nConclusion\n\nHealthcare stocks are an excellent place to look in the current market environment. The sector tends to do well in almost any economy due to the aging population, the necessity of the space, and the defensive nature of the industry, which is attractive to investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That concern is back again, with the weighting of tech stocks in the S&P 500 near their highest ever.\n\nThe tech earnings bonanza this week – with Microsoft and Alphabet out yesterday, and Amazon to come Thursday – has thrown that into relief once again.\n\nThe thinking goes that a rally led by just a few stocks leaves the overall market more vulnerable to shocks: “The current degree of crowding implies the risk of recession is far from priced in,” write JPMorgan strategists led by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas in a note to investors.\n\nWall Street analysts like to see broad participation to ensure a rally can be sustained. That’s not the case this time. And the well-worn concern over narrow leadership has collided with a newer wrinkle for the markets: the obsession with all things AI.\n\nIndeed, Lakos-Bujas points the finger at artificial intelligence, and in particular the ChatGPT-induced craze for large language models and generative AI, as the culprit for the latest leg up in mega-cap tech. He posits that 53% of the S&P 500’s gain this year is due to just six large language model innovators: Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia and Salesforce.\n\nThat’s not even accounting for Apple. Along with Microsoft, the two largest companies in the S&P 500 amount to $4.7 trillion in market capitalization, or around 13% of the index – the highest ever, according to JPMorgan.\n\nIt hasn’t been AI enthusiasm alone that has propelled tech. The belief that the Federal Reserve will cut rates before the end of the year has also been a tailwind.\n\nBut Lakos-Bujas sees trouble ahead for tech no matter where rates go: “Lower rates from this point on could signal trouble ahead while higher rates are likely to pose a headwind for rich multiples and renew cost of capital pressures.”\n\nStory continues\n\nCurrent valuations are already giving some investors pause, including Emily Bowersock Hill, founding partner at Bowersock Capital Partners. “I do think the run-up in tech stocks is overdone, and U.S. large-cap stocks are richly priced at the moment,” she told Yahoo Finance Live. “I’m not in the camp that thinks this is a great buying opportunity, especially when you look at the valuation of the market versus where it was right at the beginning of 2022.”\n\nWhatever the case, if what’s propelled tech stocks higher this year – be it optimism over lower rates or AI enthusiasm – is eroded, that could potentially mean a rocky road for the market’s overall rally.\n\nProgramming note: Wells Fargo Head of Equity Strategy Chris Harvey joins Yahoo Finance Live at 10am ET. He seems a 10% correction for stocks in the next three to six months.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

(REUTERS/Tom Brenner)\n\nThe effort comes after McCarthy approved changes to his bill last night designed to get them over the finish line after days of seeking to avoid bending to the bill's holdouts.\n\nThe late-night drama unfolded late Tuesday and early Wednesday in a Rules Committee hearing where lawmakers approved an amendment to let stand tax subsidies for ethanol in response to objections from Iowa lawmakers.\n\nThey also further tightened provisions around work requirements for programs like Medicaid after McCarthy’s most conservative members complained the first draft of the bill hadn’t gone far enough.\n\nThe hearing didn't wrap up until around 2 a.m.\n\nThe math for McCarthy\n\nMcCarthy and his allies need 218 of the 222 Republicans in the House to support the bill with Democrats in the House set to oppose the bill en-masse.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Money Making Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nAs they say, money makes the world go around, and nowhere else is this truer than in the business world. After all, businesses exist for the main reason of earning revenue and making profit, and investors invest in them only due to the chance of growing their money. Since there are thousands of stocks that are traded daily on public markets, sifting out the right ones is often a daunting task, due to the complex accounting nature of recording the cash inflows and outflows from a firm.\n\nOn this front, the field of financial analysis provides us with several methods to look 'under the hood' of a firm a.k.a. its financial reports. These reports are made up of the balance sheet, the income statement, and the statement of cash flows. Each of these explain different areas of a firm's finances. The balance sheet lists its properties, assets, investments, and liabilities and provides a longer-term picture. In comparison, the cash flow and income statements are periodic documents that show how, why, and where the money flowed in and out of a firm.\n\nCombining the information present in these lets investors and analysts decide whether a firm is worth the buck that's being put into it. One metric that's a favorite among many is the free cash flow (FCF). This is the amount left with the firm to distribute to investors after all its expenses are accounted for. However, the FCF is different from the net income, or profit, since it adds back non cash expenses such as depreciation, and the FCF is the actual amount that is reconciled with the firm's cash on hand account in the balance sheet.\n\nAnother widely popular metric used to gauge a firm's money generation capabilities is the return on equity, or ROE. This simply divides a firm's net income with its total shareholder equity, to determine how much return in percentage terms the equity investment is generating. It provides investors with a simple calculation to see if their investments are making any money, and even though the net income isn't directly paid out to the shareholder, a higher income leads to a growth in share price which then creates money for the equity investors. Out of the different industry sectors out there, the highest one in terms of ROE is the computer industry, with the latest reading of 96% according to NYU Stern's Aswath Damodaran.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, we'll take a look at some top money making stocks, with the outperformers being Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Waters Corporation (NYSE:WAT), and Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR).\n\n13 Best Money Making Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nPhoto by Christian Dubovan on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used return on equity (ROE) to select which stocks are making money right now, but since ROE alone tends to muddle things up if firms are using debt to fuel growth, the list was filtered using return on investment as well. Companies with ROE greater than 30% and ROI greater than 25% were chosen, and those with the highest ROE are listed below. All ROE figures are sourced from Morningstar.\n\n13 Best Money Making Stocks to Buy Now\n\n13.

Photo: Brendan McDermid/Reuters\n\nA lack of investment from pension funds is driving companies to pursue listing abroad, the boss of the London Stock Exchange (LSEG.L) told MPs.\n\nCambridge-based chip designer Arm, owned by Japan’s Softbank (9984.T), announced earlier this month it was seeking to list in the US this year. This is despite an intense lobbying effort from British officials to see the company make its market debut in the UK.\n\nLondon Stock Exchange boss Julia Hoggett said there needed to be more understanding that equities markets inherently involve risk.\n\n“We need to recognise that stock markets are about risk capital,” she told the Treasury select committee.\n\n“We have to recognise that not every time, companies will succeed. Some will fail, and not every companies will have the returns expected.”\n\nRead more: Arm chooses New York for key technology listing in 'kick in the teeth' for London\n\nBuilding materials giant CRH (CRH), which is headquartered in Ireland, also said it would move its primary listing to the US, citing “increased commercial, operational and acquisition opportunities.”\n\nHogget pushed UK pension funds to invest in startups as a way to make IPOs in London more attractive.\n\n“There are more teachers in Ontario financing startups in this country than teachers in Aberdeen, Cardiff or Dover,” she said in reference to the fact that UK pension funds are not investing in UK companies.\n\n“A single Canadian pension fund invested more in one UK private company in 2021 than all of our pension funds did in private companies in the UK in the same year,” she added.\n\nRead more: Trending tickers: Microsoft | Alphabet | First Republic | Meta | GSK\n\nThe Cambridge-based Arm designs the chips that power most of the world’s smartphones. It is expected to be worth as much as $70bn (£58bn) according to bankers pitching the company on the US float.\n\nVictoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said the snub was a “kick in the teeth” for London.\n\nRead more: UK watchdog blocks Microsoft’s $75bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard\n\nStory continues\n\nPeter Harrison, head of the fund manager Schroders (SDR.L) and one of the City’s most senior executives warned at the time that the UK’s failure to back “risk takers” means London is unable to compete with New York.\n\nLast year alone, there were 130 deals stateside in new Initial Public Offerings, which raised about $9bn, according to figures from EY. Around 70% of these IPOs were on US exchanges.\n\nGSK (GSK.L) chair Jonathan Symonds told MPs that lack of funding from British investors for early-stage companies is a key reason why UK companies tend to list abroad.\n\n“When a company comes to that critical decision in its life of ‘do we list and where do we list’ the vast majority of companies in UK life sciences have been almost entirely funded by US capital,” he said.\n\n“Therefore the vast majority of its board is from outside the UK.\n\n“So when it comes to the question of where do we list, the UK isn’t getting a fair opportunity.\n\n“If the capital is all imported, I don’t think we can complain if the company is exported,” added said.\n\nThe raft of British companies choosing to list abroad is a major blow to Rishi Sunak’s ambitions to make the City the first choice for tech company flotations.\n\nWatch: Arm snubs London by choosing US listing\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

The companies did not disclose terms of the deal.\n\nAtomera has developed a new material that can slot into existing semiconductor manufacturing processes to improve transistors, the tiny electrical switches at the heart of all chips. Atomera claims its material in some cases can improve transistors as much as jumping to a new-generation technology, but with lower costs.\n\nAtomera's business model is to license the technology to chip makers and then collect a small royalty on each chip made with the technology. But chipmakers integrate such new technologies quite slowly, and none of the two dozen or so companies that Atomera has engagements with are yet using its technology in mass production.\n\nAtomera Chief Executive Scott Bibaud told Reuters that STMicro, with the new deal, is now Atomera's closest customer to moving to mass production. Bibaud said there is no firm timeline for when chips with Atomera technology will be in production, but it could be within 12 to 18 months.\n\n\"The license contemplates what the royalty payments will be to us when that happens,\" Bibaud said.

A federal judge in Brazil on Wednesday, April 26, ordered a temporary suspension of messaging app Telegram, citing the social media platform's alleged failure to provide all information Federal Police requested on neo-Nazi chat groups. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nSAO PAULO (AP) — A federal judge in Brazil on Wednesday ordered a temporary suspension of messaging app Telegram, citing the social media platform's alleged failure to provide all information Federal Police requested on neo-Nazi chat groups. The move is regarded as part of the country's push against a rise in school violence.\n\nLater, several Telegram users said they could no longer use the messaging app after local carriers complied with the ruling. Google and Apple were also ordered to block the app.\n\nThe judge also increased the daily fine for non-compliance to 1 million reais (about $200,000), from 100,000 reais previously, according to the ruling, which was provided by the Justice Ministry’s press office.\n\nThe ruling from a federal court in Espírito Santo state said “the facts shown by police authorities show a clear purpose of Telegram of not cooperating with the investigation.” Brazil's federal police confirmed in a statement that the push to block Telegram is already on course.\n\nTelegram's press office didn't immediately respond to an Associated Press email requesting comment regarding whether it was aware of the ruling, and its communications with the Federal Police.\n\nThe development comes as the country grapples with a wave of school attacks, including one in November in which a man with a swastika pinned to his vest shot and killed four people and wounded 12 in the small town of Aracruz in Espírito Santo state. Brazil has seen almost two dozen attacks or violent episodes in schools since 2000, half of them in the last 12 months, including the killing of four children at a day care center on April 5.\n\nBrazil's federal government has strived to stamp out school violence with a particular focus on the supposedly nefarious influence of social media. Regulation of social media platforms was a recurring theme during a meeting earlier this month between President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, his ministers, Supreme Court justices, governors and mayors. The goal is to prevent further incidents, particularly holding platforms responsible for failing to remove content that incites violence.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpeaking at the April 18 meeting, Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes referred to social media as a “no man’s land” where users can still get away with actions and speech that are illegal in real life, and said regulation is needed. Lula voiced his support for regulation, too.\n\nLast year, de Moraes ordered a nationwide shutdown of Telegram, arguing it hadn't cooperated with authorities. He said in his ruling that Telegram repeatedly ignored requests from Brazilian authorities, including a police request to block profiles and provide information on a user, and gave Apple, Google and Brazilian phone carriers five days to block Telegram from their platforms.\n\nAt the time, one of Telegram's founders issued a statement saying there had been a miscommunication due to an outdated email address, and then apologized to the Supreme Court for its negligence. The platform was not taken down.\n\nFar-right former President Jair Bolsonaro and his allies encouraged followers to join Telegram after January 2021 — the same month former U.S. President Donald Trump, an inspiration for the Brazilian leader, was permanently suspended from Twitter in the wake of the Jan. 6 riots at Capitol Hill."

		"content": "When it comes to achieving market-beating returns consistently, few investors have done a better job than Warren Buffett.\n\nFrom 1964 to 2022, his company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) delivered an overall gain of 3,787,464%, dwarfing the S&P 500’s 24,708% return during the same period.\n\nBuffett’s investment strategy centers around value investing. He found high-quality companies with durable competitive advantages, invested in them when they were trading below their intrinsic value and reaped huge rewards when those companies’ shares went up in value over time.\n\nAt the same time, Buffett also collects dividends — a lot of dividends.\n\nCheck out: Why Warren Buffett's Investing Strategy Is More Relevant Than Ever In Today's Real Estate Market\n\nRising Dividend Plays\n\nBerkshire’s portfolio largely consists of companies with deeply entrenched market positions. And those companies are able to reward shareholders with regular cash payouts.\n\nBetter yet, the payouts can grow over time.\n\nCase in point: Buffett started buying Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) shares in the late 1980s. Today, Berkshire holds 400 million shares of the beverage giant worth $25.8 billion.\n\nWith some of the most iconic brands in the beverage business, Coca-Cola has been running a recession-proof business. The company is also a dividend giant. In 2022, Coca-Cola paid $7.6 billion in dividends to shareholders.\n\nAnd the payout is still growing. In February, Coca-Cola’s board approved a 4.6% increase to the quarterly dividend to 46 cents per share, marking the 61st consecutive annual dividend increase. At the current share price, the company offers an annual dividend yield of 2.9%.\n\nThen there’s energy giant Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX), which is currently Berkshire’s third-largest holding by value.\n\nIn January, Chevron raised its quarterly dividend by approximately 6% to $1.51 per share. Strong commodity prices allowed the company to gush profits and cash flow.\n\nOf course, oil and gas prices don’t always go up. But Chevron’s payout has been resilient: The company is on track to make 2023 its 36th consecutive year with an increase in annual dividend payout per share. It currently yields 3.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Buffett isn’t known for being a tech investor, Berkshire’s largest holding right now is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), which also happens to pay increasing dividends.\n\nOver the last five years, Apple’s quarterly payout has gone up by 46%.\n\nRetail Investors’ Advantage\n\nCommanding a market capitalization of over $700 billion, Berkshire is now a behemoth. While Buffett has certainly enjoyed seeing his company skyrocketing in value, the sheer size of Berkshire may actually pose a hurdle to explosive growth.\n\nBuffett pointed out the issue in 1999 in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, when Berkshire was quite a bit smaller than it is today.\n\n“If I was running $1 million today, or $10 million for that matter, I’d be fully invested. Anyone who says that size does not hurt investment performance is selling,” he said.\n\n“The highest rates of return I’ve ever achieved were in the 1950s. I killed the Dow. You ought to see the numbers. But I was investing peanuts then. It’s a huge structural advantage not to have a lot of money. I think I could make you 50% a year on $1 million. No, I know I could. I guarantee that.”\n\nIn other words, Buffett found opportunities to generate extraordinary returns when he was running a small portfolio. But as his portfolio grew exponentially over the decades, he no longer enjoyed the structural advantage of being small.\n\nBuffett still delivered, and Berkshire’s market value continued to increase at an impressive pace since 1999. But it’s true that returns like 50% a year are hard to find after you grow past a certain size.\n\nIf you are running a portfolio of hundreds of billions of dollars, a home run on a small investment probably won’t move the needle.\n\nAnd that could be good news for retail investors. Because they are not running giant portfolios, they can still capitalize on opportunities that are effectively closed to investors like Buffett.\n\nRead next: You Can Become A Landlord In Just 10 Minutes Thanks To This Jeff Bezos-Backed Startup\n\nDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

But Redburn analyst Agnieszka Pustula told Reuters in an e-mail that this was below expectations of 8.2% growth, despite price increases from partners like Spotify.\n\nTop sellers included King & Prince, Morgan Wallen and Taylor Swift, the group said.\n\n($1 = 0.9061 euros) (Reporting by Olivier Sorgho; Editing by Jane Merriman, Josie Kao and Leslie Adler)"

MacRumors spotted an Amazon listing that showed images and details for Apple's Beats Studio Buds+ — the page even allowed customers to pre-order the earbuds until it was yanked offline. The earbuds, which were listed for $170 or $20 more than the current model, will have a transparent option that puts their internal components on display, similar to Nothing's design. That said, they will also be available in black and ivory for those who aren't quite as intrigued or enamored by transparent electronics.\n\nAccording to the listing, the Studio Buds+ can run up to 36 hours, instead of just 24 when combined with the charging case like the current model. Speaking of the charging case, it seems to retain its predecessor's shape, except it's most likely lighter. The upcoming product's item weight is 3.87 ounces, while the current Studio Buds' is listed as ‎4.5 ounces.\n\nThe Studio Buds+ microphones are three times larger than the current model's, and they also have a more powerful processor. Those components enable 1.6 more active noise cancelling power and a transparency mode — that is, the mode that lets some ambient noise in so the user remains aware of their surroundings — that's apparently twice as effective.\n\nThe upcoming earbuds also support spatial audio for immersive sounds, \"always on\" Siri and compatibility with Apple's \"Find My\" tracking app. Plus, they feature one-touch pairing with both Apple and Android devices, as well as automatic switching that makes it easy to use them with multiple phones and tablets. Considering the Amazon page for the Studio Buds+ seems to have the complete details about the model, we'll likely see it go back up in the coming weeks when Apple is ready to take pre-orders."

Hong/AP\n\nThe UK’s competition regulator has moved to block Microsoft’s (MSFT) acquisition of the Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard, in a possible fatal blow to the $69bn (£55bn)deal.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority said it believed the company would be commercially motivated to make Activision’s games exclusive to its own cloud gaming service.\n\nCloud gaming is a technology that enables gamers to access games via companies’ remote servers, allowing users to stream a game like one would on Netflix.\n\nMartin Coleman, chair of the independent panel of experts conducting the CMA investigation, said: “Microsoft already enjoys a powerful position and head start over other competitors in cloud gaming and this deal would strengthen that advantage, giving it the ability to undermine new and innovative competitors.\n\n“Microsoft engaged constructively with us to try to address these issues and we are grateful for that, but their proposals were not effective to remedy our concerns and would have replaced competition with ineffective regulation in a new and dynamic market.\n\n“Cloud gaming needs a free, competitive market to drive innovation and choice.\n\n“That is best achieved by allowing the current competitive dynamics in cloud gaming to continue to do their job.”\n\nRead more: Trending tickers: Microsoft | Alphabet | First Republic | Meta | GSK\n\nIn a statement, Microsoft’s president Brad Smith said the company was “disappointed” by the CMA’s decision and claimed it would appeal.\n\n“We remain fully committed to this acquisition and will appeal. The CMA’s decision rejects a pragmatic path to address competition concerns and discourages technology innovation and investment in the United Kingdom.\n\n“We have already signed contracts to make Activision Blizzard’s popular games available on 150 million more devices, and we remain committed to reinforcing these agreements through regulatory remedies. We’re especially disappointed that after lengthy deliberations, this decision appears to reflect a flawed understanding of this market and the way the relevant cloud technology actually works.”\n\nStory continues\n\nEd Vaizey, the former Tech and Culture minister, has criticised the move by the regulator to block Microsoft's swoop on Activision.\n\nA spokeswoman for Activision Blizzard said: “The CMA’s report contradicts the ambitions of the UK to become an attractive country to build technology businesses.\n\n“We will work aggressively with Microsoft to reverse this on appeal. The report’s conclusions are a disservice to UK citizens, who face increasingly dire economic prospects.\n\n“We will reassess our growth plans for the UK. Global innovators large and small will take note that – despite all its rhetoric – the UK is clearly closed for business.”\n\nRead more: Bitcoin rises as concerns over First Republic Bank escalate\n\nSophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"The CMA has concerns that the deal could undermine fair competition in cloud gaming if the Xbox maker decides to make Activision’s games exclusive to its cloud gaming platform. Cutting alternative distribution off at the knees is seen as a step too far for the UK authorities.\n\n\"Scepticism among shareholders about the proposed takeover was already rife, the CMA is not the only regulatory body to be sniffing around the deal. Microsoft has plenty of financial resource to appeal the decision, with over $50bn of net cash languishing on the balance sheet.\"\n\nWatch: Diablo 4 ‘is not intended to be played forever,’ says Blizzard\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android."

And what that means is, we can prevent lateral attacks and data breaches by securing cloud native applications from the inside out,” Bhavsar told TechCrunch.\n\nPriyanka Tembey, CTO and co-founder, says that the solution helps security teams build guard rails for runtime applications as they are being developed. “Operant customers can install Operant within their dev staging and production Kubernetes environments, and we start learning about their application interactions, service-to-service interactions, API interactions, as well as data flows at runtime, so when they are running live in the production environments. And then we are able to apply those learnings back into the dev staging environments, as well to start protecting the applications and the API’s from the get-go,” she said.\n\nThis means that companies use Operant across the development process including the development tooling, the CI/CD pipeline, the API gateways and the containers and micro services themselves. Tembey admits they are covering a lot of ground, but that’s the idea. “The product does a lot of things today, and that’s where we actually see the application security direction going because applications in the cloud tend to be multilayer,” she said.\n\nThat requires a comprehensive approach to keep the application secure. “It’s not just the application, but then it’s the container, it’s the microservice layer, it’s the API, the data flow layer and so on. And so we interface at different layers of the applications with our technology and are able to get the right telemetry, and by that I mean the right data, the operational data about what is happening at those layers” she said.\n\nOperant has the intelligence to put all of that data and those context streams together. “And it creates live API catalogs, service interaction maps for customers, and then through enforcements it interacts with different layers in the Kubernetes as well as in the cloud layers to actually protect those APIs and those data flows by enforcing the security policies that customers approve or create through our product,” she said.\n\nThe company launched in 2020, and began building the product in 2021. It took some time to build a product of this complexity. They began working with design partners last year and are emerging today and companies can begin signing up to use the product. The startup has six people right now with plans to perhaps double that this year. With two women co-founders — CMO Ashley Roof is also part of the founding team — the company cares deeply about building a diverse organization as they scale up.\n\n“We are very passionate about diversity. As you can tell, there are two women on the founding team and just building that diverse team from the ground up is very important to us,” Tembey said.\n\nToday’s $3 million investment was led by Felicis. The company previously raised a $500,000 pre-seed round, bringing the total raised to $3.5 million."

With Meta results out later, its stock was up 2% and Amazon raced ahead 4%.\n\nApple reports next week, with some eyes on its move into financial services as it muscles in on high-yield savings accounts that pander to jittery depositors.\n\nJudged by another near 50% drop in First Republic's already battered shares on Tuesday - amid reports of asset sales to fill the $100 billion hole in deposits that it reported from the March blowup - that banking instability smoulders.\n\nBut despite the fresh wobble across banking indices on Tuesday, it wasn't all bad news in the sector.\n\nPacWest Bancorp's shares jumped 15% in extended trading after the regional lender said deposits have been building recently. And in Europe, Standard Chartered shares bucked otherwise dour markets on a forecast-beating 21% jump in first-quarter profits.\n\nAnd while the blizzard of corporate earnings this week makes it hard to see the wood for the trees, the aggregate readout on first quarter S&P500 earnings shows almost 80% of firms beating forecasts so far and the estimated annual profit contraction ebbing to 3.9% from more than 5% earlier this month.\n\nThe relatively mixed picture was also reflected in the incoming macro numbers - where a drop in April consumer confidence contrasted with further signs of a rebound in housing.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, the news saw S&P500 futures gain 0.5% before the bell - recouping some of Tuesday's 1.5% drop and offsetting modest losses on many Asian and European bourses.\n\nSimmering nerves about the looming U.S. debt ceiling standoff persisted, however, with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen again warning of 'economic catastrophe' if the debt cap is not lifted and U.S. sovereign credit default swaps creeping higher.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives could on Wednesday vote on a bill to sharply cut spending for a decade in exchange for a short-term hike in the debt ceiling, though it is unclear if it has enough support in the Republican majority to pass.\n\nThe implications of Republicans being unable to agree a bill that even gets through the House - as it will likely fail in a Democrat-led Senate anyway - offers markets the prospect of the debt ceiling being hit without any real negotiations, leaving it down to a thin Republican majority in the house whether to force a crisis or vote to lift the cap and fight another day.\n\nU.S. Treasury markets continued to rally, with yields on 2-year notes dropping below 4% Tuesday and testing 3.9% early today. With the bank reverberations and debt ceiling uncertainty in the background, near certainty on one more Federal Reserve interest rate rise next month weakened at bit too - as futures cut the chances of another quarter-point hike to 80%.\n\nThe dollar fell back across the board.\n\nEvents to watch out for on Wednesday:\n\n* U.S. March durable goods orders, wholesale/retail inventories, advance trade balance\n\n* U.S. corp earnings: Meta, eBay, CME, Boeing, Thermo Fisher Scientific, American Tower, Boston Scientific, Vale, SK Hynix, Hess, Universal Music, Hilton, EQT, Roku, KLA, Pioneer Natural Resources, Teradyne, Align, General Dynamics, Norfolk Southern, Otis Worldwide, Dover, ADP, Allegion, MAsco, Humana etc\n\n* European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos speaks; Bank of Canada releases policy minutes\n\n* U.S. Treasury auctions 5-year note, 2-yr floating rate note\n\n* South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol meets U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington\n\nGraphic: Alphabet and Microsoft talk up AI - https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-STOCKS/AI/lgvdkajbepo/chart.png\n\nGraphic: AI dominates quarterly conference calls - https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-STOCKS/AI/zdvxdkqervx/chart_eikon.jpg\n\nGraphic: US earnings recession - https://www.reuters.com/graphics/TEST-TEST/jnpwybaropw/chart_eikon.jpg\n\nGraphic: U.S. consumer confidence falls - https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-STOCKS/dwvkdlzyapm/consconf.png\n\nGraphic: U.S. new home sales jump - https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-STOCKS/egpbyqoekvq/nhs.png\n\n(By Mike Dolan, editing by XXXX mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

		"content": "(Bloomberg) -- The fate of First Republic Bank has become a game of chicken between the US government and the lender’s largest rivals, with both sides seeking to avoid steep losses and hoping the other will save the troubled firm.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAs the bank’s stock keeps lurching lower — dropping 49% on Tuesday and 30% on Wednesday — regulators have so far refrained from stepping in. They’re betting that banks that deposited $30 billion into First Republic last month can hash out a deal to ensure the firm doesn’t fail and take some of their money with it.\n\nSenior officials at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. have even discussed whether to lower their private assessment of the bank, a move that would curb its access to a pair of Federal Reserve lending facilities.\n\nRead more: First Republic Said to Face Potential Curb on Borrowing From Fed\n\nOn the other side, executives at several big banks are balking at getting even more involved in a way that would lock in losses. Some expect that if they wait, they will get at least some of those deposits back — and might fare even better than if they intervene, potentially throwing good money after bad.\n\n“There is some nervousness about how Silicon Valley Bank went down, and maybe they’d like to see if First Republic can work out its problems itself,” said Stephen Lubben, a professor at Seton Hall University School of Law.\n\n“Regulators are also probably worried that if this does not stop, who is next?” he said. “That is, who comes after First Republic on the hot seat?”\n\nA spokesperson for First Republic declined to comment.\n\nFirst Republic’s issues stem from its stockpile of loans at low interest rates, including an unusually large portfolio of jumbo mortgages to wealthy clients. Those debts have lost value amid Federal Reserve hikes, prompting some depositors to yank their money.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Interest-Only Loans to Hamptons Set Impale First Republic\n\nAfter the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March stoked concerns about the soundness of regional lenders, First Republic was left paying more for funding than it earns on many of its assets. That means the firm faces what analysts predict will be at least a year of losses.\n\nThe bank remains fully operational, and executives emphasized in an earnings report on Monday that it has more than ample access to cash to serve clients. Still, its leaders acknowledged that they are looking for strategic options.\n\nThe clock for striking such a deal began ticking louder late last week. US regulators reached out to some industry leaders, encouraging them to make a renewed push to find a private solution to shore up First Republic’s balance sheet, according to people with knowledge of the discussions.\n\nThe calls also came with a warning that banks should be prepared in case something happens soon.\n\nProposed Deals\n\nA number of rescue proposals have so far failed to come to fruition.\n\nEarlier this week, Bloomberg reported that First Republic was looking to potentially sell $50 billion to $100 billion of assets to big banks that would also receive warrants or preferred equity as an incentive to buy the holdings above their market value.\n\nBy Wednesday, the firm’s advisers were privately pitching a similar concept, in which stronger banks would buy bonds off of First Republic’s books for more than they were worth so that it could sell shares to new investors. While that would mean booking initial losses, banks could hold the debts through repayment to be made whole.\n\nIn that scenario, the proponents suggested, big banks might save money by ensuring the safety of their $30 billion in deposits and avoiding a special FDIC assessment if the regulator were to step in.\n\nBut executives at five of the biggest banks, speaking on the condition they not be named, dismissed the notion of once again banding together to prop up First Republic, especially when it could mean paving the way for investors or a competitor to scoop up the firm at a bargain price.\n\nOne expressed a willingness to participate — only if regulators forced the group to take action.\n\nRecovering Deposits\n\nSeveral banks would prefer that, if it becomes necessary, the FDIC seize First Republic and sell it off. Such a resolution, they said, would be cleaner, even if banks lose money. Some have already taken reserves.\n\nThe group of banks accounted for most of First Republic’s $50 billion of uninsured deposits at the end of the first quarter. But, as depositors, they would be at the front of the line to recover money if First Republic were resolved. Two executives whose firms contributed $5 billion apiece in deposits last month said they would expect to at least retrieve some — though not all — of that money in a worst-case scenario.\n\nAcross the industry, First Republic’s quarterly earnings report on Monday has come to be regarded as a disaster. The firm announced a larger-than-expected drop in deposits, then declined to take questions as executives presenting a 12-minute briefing on results.\n\nThe shares promptly tilted into a dive in late trading that day. Altogether, they’re down 95% this year.\n\nIndustry executives said it’s possible that — regardless of the stock — First Republic can press onward indefinitely.\n\nAnd the FDIC has shown it’s in no rush to seize the firm and take another multibillion-dollar hit to its insurance fund.\n\nFor would-be rescuers, the collapse of SVB and Signature Bank offered an unfortunate reminder last month: Bidders can sometimes score the most lucrative deal by being patient and waiting to scoop up a bank or its assets once the agency intervenes.\n\nAfter those two lenders were sold off, both of the acquirers saw their stocks pop.\n\n--With assistance from Matthew Monks, Sonali Basak, Sridhar Natarajan, Gillian Tan, Max Reyes and Katanga Johnson.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n©2023 Bloomberg L.P."

This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home\n\nThat’s been good news for Bluesky, an invite-only rival that has quickly gained a following since debuting in February. So far, its app has been downloaded 360,000 times from Apple’s app store worldwide, consumer data group Data.ai told Fortune, and over a million more users are on the waitlist to join. Most of the new users have been added this month, according to Bloomberg.\n\nBluesky was created by Jack Dorsey, who happens to also be Twitter’s co-founder. In contrast to Twitter, he wanted to build a decentralized service, meaning its user data is stored in independent servers rather than in ones owned by one company—thereby giving users more autonomy in how they interact on the platform.\n\n“We envision an open social media ecosystem where developers have more opportunity to build and innovate, and users have more choice and control over which services they use and their experience on social media as a whole,” Jay Graber, CEO of Bluesky, wrote in a blog post last year.\n\nDorsey has said that one of his regrets was commercializing Twitter. If he had a chance to do it over again, he’d make it more like an open source project.\n\n“The biggest issue and my biggest regret is that it [Twitter] became a company,” Dorsey tweeted in August, responding to a question about whether the platform turned out like he wanted it to.\n\nThe biggest issue and my biggest regret is that it became a company. — jack (@jack) August 25, 2022\n\nBluesky’s rise comes amid growing scrutiny over data security on social media sites as well as complaints about Twitter under Musk’s leadership. Those include Twitter requiring users to pay for blue check marks that signal their identities have been verified (these check marks were previously free) and then deciding to give away blue check marks to certain high-profile people (in some cases, dead people). Some recipients of free check marks are angry because the marks falsely make it appear as if they paid.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Bluesky could offer\n\nThe origin story of Bluesky is closely linked to Twitter. It received its initial funding in 2021 from Twitter—Dorsey was the CEO until November of that year (it’s unclear exactly when the funding was received). Dorsey is also on Bluesky’s board. The service is still considered to be in a test phase and has a waitlist for users looking to join it. The timing of any broader rollout is unclear.\n\nBluesky didn’t immediately return Fortune’s request for comment.\n\nDespite the deep links between the two social media apps, users’ search for an alternate social platform could be a direct result of Musk's shake-up of Twitter. When Musk took over the company’s reins late last October, he fired top executives and, within weeks, half of the company’s staff. Twitter no longer has much of a content moderation team and, because of a lack of engineers, suffered occasional outages. The platform has become a breeding ground for hate speech and racist content, according to the Washington Post.\n\nBluesky isn’t the only alternative to Twitter that has gained momentum since Musk became the owner of a social media company. Mastodon, another decentralized service, founded in 2016, has grown rapidly. Shortly after Musk’s Twitter purchase, the number of Mastodon users increased sharply. They grew from 300,000 users in late October to 2.6 million at its peak in late November, Wired reported. But that growth has been hard to sustain. By February, the number of downloads slumped as much as 99%.\n\nEven with challenges, decentralized platforms could address some of the larger concerns over user data in the hands of individual companies—one of the key themes surrounding the Congressional hearing of TikTok last month.\n\n“We believe decentralization is a means to end,” Graber wrote in a blog post last month. “The end goal is to provide choice to users, freedom to developers, and control to creators.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nMore from Fortune:\n\n5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home\n\nLooking to make extra cash?

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources , and more. Learn More .\n\nAs a shareholder in Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), I like the strong cash flows that the company throws off. But, at some point, I wonder whether a shareholder like me might be able to make better use of them than the tech giant. So, could an Alphabet dividend be on the cards in coming years?\n\nTo pay or not to pay\n\nWhen a company generates spare cash it can invest it in the business, or pay it out to shareholders as dividends.\n\nMany tech companies start by not paying dividends. Alphabet is an example, as is Amazon. Others go for years without paying a dividend before changing tack and making regular shareholder payouts. Apple is an example.\n\nIn any case, Alphabet keeping money to grow its business has made sense while it has huge growth opportunities.\n\nBut the thing is that Alphabet does not really need all that money. Indeed, that is why rather than reinvesting it all in the business, it has already been using some of it to buy back shares.\n\nThat is on a big scale: the company announced yesterday that it plans to spend another $70bn on upcoming buybacks.\n\nDividend prospects\n\nIf it has that much spare cash floating around, could we see an Alphabet dividend?\n\nI think the answer is yes. Companies sometimes prefer buybacks as they help improve earnings per share even when total profits are flat. But many shareholders like dividends and paying one can improve sentiment towards a share, potentially boosting its price.\n\nAlphabet is a moneymaking machine. Net income in the first quarter fell 8% compared to the same period last year, but still came in at $15.1bn. Job cuts could lead to higher profits, while the risk of an advertising downturn hurting earnings did not seem to materialise strongly in the quarter’s earnings. Net cash flows from operating activities fell 6% year on year to $23.5bn.\n\nThose are huge numbers.\n\nAlphabet shares have fallen 11% in the past year on fears that AI could eat into revenues and profits at the core search business. But I do not think that risk showed through strongly in the results. Meanwhile, non-search businesses like Google Cloud continue to gain traction, with that division reporting 28% revenue growth.\n\nIf the share price rises, buying back shares may be less economically attractive for the company. An Alphabet dividend could make more sense as a way to distribute excess cash to shareholders.\n\nLong-term hold\n\nHowever, I do not know when that might happen. For now, at least, management seems content not to pay a dividend.\n\nYet if a rising share price means buybacks offer poorer value for the company, I think that could change. At some point in the next three to five years, I expect management will need to engage seriously with the prospect of introducing an Alphabet dividend.\n\nWhether that happens remains to be seen. But I continue to like Alphabet’s strong brand, large customer base, competitive advantage and attractive valuation. I plan to hold my Alphabet shares for the foreseeable future."

		"content": "(Bloomberg) -- Glencore Plc reiterated its offer to buy Teck Resources Ltd. and said it’s still willing to bid more, pressing its advantage after the Canadian miner’s shareholders rejected a plan to split the business.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe companies have spent the past three weeks in a bruising fight to win over Teck investors, after its board and controlling shareholder publicly rejected Glencore’s proposal. The Swiss commodities giant offered to buy Teck for $23 billion and then create two new companies combining their respective metals and coal businesses.\n\nTeck canceled a shareholder vote on its plan to spin off its coal business just hours before a shareholder meeting on Wednesday, admitting that it did not have the support it needed. The company said it would work on a new plan to split out coal, and once again dismissed Glencore’s proposal.\n\nRead: Teck Pulls Vote on Coal Split, Handing Momentum to Glencore\n\nGlencore on Thursday repeated that it is willing to improve its offer if Teck will enter talks, but that it is prepared to make a bid directly to shareholders otherwise.\n\nStill, any attempt by Glencore to circumvent Teck’s board would face significant hurdles without support from its founding family, the Keevils, who have a blocking vote because they dominate the company’s “supervoting” Class A shares.\n\n“Glencore hopes that the Teck board will, against the backdrop of the feedback provided by its shareholders, engage constructively in order to fully explore our proposal which has not been done to date,” the company said in statement.\n\nThe vote on Wednesday had turned into a showdown over the future of Teck — Glencore said its proposal would be dead if the spinoff were approved, as it tried to persuade shareholders to vote “no” and pressure the company to engage.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe collapse of Teck’s proposal has put the miner on the back foot. Teck Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Price said yesterday that the miner would come up with simpler plan to separate coal, a goal that he said was supported by most shareholders. Glencore instead has framed the failed vote as a mandate to begin talks on its offer.\n\nTeck had proposed creating a new steelmaking coal company, called Elk Valley Resources, that would continue to pay a royalty to its remaining metals business for several years. The plan was criticized as being too complicated, as the ongoing link between the two companies would have muddied its appeal for investors who no longer wanted exposure to coal.\n\nGlencore made its proposal to Teck on March 26 and has so far held off increasing the price tag, although it later offered to add a cash component to buy shareholders out of the combined coal business.\n\n(Updates with details throughout)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n©2023 Bloomberg L.P."

Tesla claims that Huang was playing a video game on his phone before the crash and didn’t pay attention to vehicle warnings.\n\nA hearing was set for Thursday on whether to depose Musk.\n\nReuters reports that Musk will likely be questioned about a 2016 statement cited by plaintiffs in which he allegedly said: “A Model S and Model X, at this point, can drive autonomously with greater safety than a person. Right now.”\n\nTesla’s lawyers have opposed the request in court filings. They said Musk can’t recall the details of statements plaintiffs want to question him on, and that he is often the subject of “deepfake” videos, according to Reuters.\n\nJudge Evette Pennypacker of Santa Clara Superior Court said Tesla’s arguments were “deeply troubling” because they imply that as a famous person, Musk is more of a target for deepfakes, which would make his public statements immune. The result would be that Musk and other famous people could in future avoid taking ownership of what they say and do.\n\nTechCrunch could not get a comment from Tesla, which disbanded its press office in 2020.\n\nThe lawsuit is scheduled to go to trial on July 31. It will add to the growing list of litigation and regulatory scrutiny into the automaker for its Autopilot system, which includes a criminal investigation from the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nThat said, Tesla last week had a big win in court over a similar case. A Tesla owner sued the company in 2020, saying that her Model S swerved into a curb while on Autopilot and an airbag deployed so violently as to cause medical damage. A jury in Los Angeles Superior Court ruled the Autopilot feature did not fail."

You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here or get IRL or virtual tickets for Consensus 2023 here.\n\nCoinDesk sat down with Smith ahead of Consensus 2023 to get her thoughts on the current regulatory moment, the policies crypto needs and life as a lobbyist on the Hill.\n\nWhat do you make of the term \"Operation Choke Point 2.0,\" coined to describe a seemingly coordinated effort among various U.S. government agencies to dislocate crypto from the wider economy?\n\nBlockchain Association is currently investigating claims of crypto de-banking, launching a tipline – debanked@theblockchainassociation.org – and asking industry participants to come forward with stories. We’re committed to discovering the truth about these allegations.\n\nDo you think we could expect to see comprehensive crypto regulation in the U.S. this year or in the coming years?\n\nThe industry will likely have to wait 18 to 22 months to see real movement. However, we are still in a period of great opportunity to continue educating and laying the foundation for a strong regulatory future.\n\nCould you give us an inside view into your work in Washington. D.C.? Are you finding it easier to engage with policymakers these days?\n\nPolicymaker education is critical – and that’s our top priority at Blockchain Association.

		"content": "SolStock / iStock.com\n\nLiving on $1,000 per month sounds impossible; and, for many, it might be.\n\nBut it can be done with some strategic planning, intentional action and the ability to compromise. You won’t be able to do everything you want to do when living on only $1,000 per month, but you can make it work.\n\nFood Stamps: What Is the Maximum SNAP EBT Benefit for 2023?\n\nLearn: How To Build Your Savings From Scratch\n\nWe’ve put together a quick step-by-step guide on how to live on $1,000 per month by focusing on significantly lowering your expenses and building a strategy for keeping them low. At the same time, we have advice for finding additional assistance to help cover costs, as well as finding a way to eventually increase your income.\n\nHere’s how to live on $1,000 per month.\n\nReview Your Current Spending\n\nIf you don’t have a lot of income, the one thing you can control is your spending. While there are a million ways to optimize your budget, you need to know how much you are spending right now before you can create a spending plan that you’ll stick to.\n\nThe exercise looks like this:\n\nDownload bank and credit card statements from the last 90 days\n\nReview your spending and categorize all transactions\n\nDivide everything by 3\n\nReview your “average spending” for each category\n\nThis is the tried-and-true method for finding out where you’re actually spending all of your money, and it will help you quickly find areas that you can cut, especially when trying to live on a very limited income.\n\nTake Our Poll: What Are You Worth to Your Company?\n\nMinimize Housing Costs\n\nWith the average rent costs in America topping $1,900 per month, according to Rent.com, there is no way to live on $1,000 per month unless you take some drastic measures around your housing costs. You will need to get creative to find a way to lower your costs, and it most likely will involve roommates or living with family for a reduced cost.\n\nIf you split an apartment with roommates, it also will help you lower your utility costs — i.e., you can split those up three or four ways. On $1,000 per month, a reasonable rent cost would be around $300 to $400 per month.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you’re willing to live at home with your parents or other family and they are willing to have you, you might be able to eliminate housing costs altogether. Just remember: This should be seen as a temporary arrangement as you work on increasing your income or it might become a point of contention.\n\nDon’t Drive a Car\n\nThere’s no easy way to say this, but you probably can’t afford to drive a car on $1,000 per month. With the price of gas, insurance, car maintenance and repairs, driving a car can easily cost you $500 per month — even without a car payment.\n\nTo get to work and move around town, you need to consider an alternative form of transportation. If you live in an area with a good public transportation system, you can get a monthly pass to ride the bus or subway; some cities even offer light rail and other mass transit options.\n\nAlso, consider carpooling to work and riding a bike to get around town.\n\nMeal Plan on the Cheap\n\nIf you are trying to live on $1,000 a month, you aren’t going to be eating out at restaurants, and you need to meal plan each week to keep your food costs in check. This means you need to create a list of low-cost meals and a strict shopping list to keep your monthly grocery bill around $200.\n\nThere are some programs and apps that can help with this (such as eMeals), and there are entire YouTube and TikTok channels dedicated to keeping your grocery bill at very low levels. If needed, you also can build a system of shopping coupon deals to make your food dollars stretch even further.\n\nAvoid Subscriptions at All Costs\n\nIf you’re trying to live on $1,000 per month, subscriptions have no place in your life. With an abundance of free media apps, YouTube and free access to millions of songs on music apps, you don’t need to pay for premium subscription services until you get your income up.\n\nIf you’re not sure which apps you’ve signed up for with a premium subscription, services like Rocket Money can link to your bank accounts and credit cards to find any unwanted subscriptions. This will help you quickly identify services to cancel or put on pause until you’re income is a bit higher.\n\nNegotiate Your Bills\n\nEverything is negotiable. When you’re living on a low income, you need to take advantage of this by negotiating your bills lower. From utilities to cell phone bills to internet services and even your rent, you can always ask for a discount.\n\nThis means you call your service companies individually and ask whether they have any better deals available. For example, internet bills are notorious for having welcome offers that expire, increasing your bill by as much as 50%. You can call your internet service provider and ask whether there is a lower-cost option or a deal that would get you close to the initial offer.\n\nIf negotiation doesn’t lower your costs, consider changing service providers (if possible). Most want to compete for your business and might offer a lower price to entice you to switch.\n\nTake Advantage of Government Programs\n\nIf you’re on your own and have a net income of less than $1,133, you might qualify for SNAP benefits and receive government assistance. This could help you supplement (or completely cover) your food budget.\n\nThere are also programs to help cover the cost of a cell phone and internet services. Assurant Wireless gives you a free phone with talk, text and data services. The Affordable Connectivity Program can give you discounted (or free) internet service as well.\n\nSide Hustle for More Income\n\nThe harsh truth is that $1,000 per month is very hard to live on, even if you lower your costs to the bare minimum. With inflation causing the prices of goods and services to increase every year, $1,000 a month will become harder and harder to live on going forward.\n\nFinding a side hustle can help you quickly increase your income and give you a little breathing room in your budget. Things like becoming a video editor, freelance writer, food shopper, virtual assistant or dog sitter can help you earn hundreds of extra dollars per month. It takes some extra effort, but you can double your income by building a well-managed side hustle.\n\nBottom Line\n\nLiving on $1,000 per month is a challenge. From the high costs of housing, transportation and food, plus trying to keep your bills to a minimum, it would be difficult for anyone living alone to make this work. But with some creativity, roommates and strategy, you might be able to pull it off. Just remember: At this income level, you should put most of your effort into making extra money, as you can cut costs only so much.\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How To Live on $1,000 Per Month"

The company hopes to open 20 to 30 stores each year as a part of the goal.\n\nThe U.S. stores, which will be located in malls in two California locations, Maryland and New Jersey, are in areas where the chain already has a presence.\n\nThe two Canadian stores opening in Ottawa and Calgary -- the first Uniqlo locations in those cities -- each total 15,000 square feet (1,393.55 square meters).\n\nEach of the new stores will be equipped with self-checkout kiosks, in-store pickup and free clothing alterations.\n\nFast Retailing reported a 16.4% rise to 220 billion yen ($1.65 billion) in first-half operating profit earlier this month. The company also raised its full-year profit forecast to 360 billion yen ($2.7 billion) from 350 billion yen ($2.63 billion).\n\nDaisuke Tsukagoshi, Uniqlo North America chief executive, said in an email to Reuters that the chain chose to launch the Ottawa and Calgary stores after seeing a \"strong online presence\" there.\n\nThe Tokyo-based retailer currently has 47 stores in the U.S. and 16 locations in Canada.\n\n\"We're looking to locations where we have already seen high customer demand, as well as new markets that we see opportunity in,\" Tsukagoshi added.\n\nTsukagoshi said that localizing product offerings in the U.S.'s various regions has been \"challenging\" as shoppers deal with different climates and experiences.\n\nHe said Uniqlo is in a \"unique position\" to open stores in the current economic environment as shoppers trade down and turn to accessible pricing for essential styles.\n\nUniqlo has gained popularity in the U.S. for its relatively low pricing including women's t-shirts for $14.90 and men's zip-up jackets for $39.90.\n\nStory continues\n\nUniqlo currently has 1,028 stores in Greater China and 79 in Europe, according to its website.\n\nFor comparison, Gap Inc boasts more than 2,100 stores, including Old Navy and the Gap brand, in the U.S. alone.

		"content": "(Bloomberg) -- Even after netting a tidy profit from the recent banking turmoil, Boaz Weinstein isn’t gloating. In fact, he says, the big gains for those wagering on a credit crunch are only just getting started.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThat’s how his hedge fund, Saba Capital Management, is positioned — with bets on stress he says is probably already ripping through private credit and insurers. Saba runs a tail-risk strategy that thrives in dislocated markets, one of a handful that feed his flagship fund which gained 73% in 2020’s pandemic. The $4.3 billion hedge fund clocked up returns in March from banking turmoil including a trade on Credit Suisse Group AG, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\n“From where I sit, the chance of a major selloff in the next six months, relative to how inexpensive it is to hedge it, has never been higher,” Weinstein said in an interview at Bloomberg’s London office.\n\nIn his view, that selloff could push credit spreads toward crisis levels, trigger a surge in bankruptcies and upend life insurers that have piled into private credit and commercial real estate.\n\nTo profit from falling markets, the firm looks for aberrations in credit-default swaps on individual companies. It writes protection on high-quality names whose CDS it views as expensive, and buys protection on cyclical companies and financial companies whose risks are being underpriced.\n\nRecently Weinstein, the former co-head of credit at Deutsche Bank AG, has sensed banks getting nervous. He says they’ve been quietly cutting risk through credit derivatives in an effort to build up capital ratios against a coming wave of defaults.\n\n“For the first time in my career we traded Apple CDS. I’m confident the buyer doesn’t think the spread is too low, but that’s because they needed a hedge,” Weinstein said. “The amount of CDS they need to buy at times can seem almost insatiable.”\n\nStory continues\n\nWeinstein reaped gains from a dual long and short bet on Credit Suisse in March, according to the person familiar, who declined to be named speaking about private information. The so-called curve trade anticipated the Swiss lender would face greater volatility in the next two years than the subsequent eight.\n\nPerhaps his most famous trade came in 2012, when he rode a bet on a bank rushing to offload risk, taking the other side of outsize wagers made by JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s so-called London Whale.\n\nLike almost everyone on Wall Street, Weinstein admits he didn’t foresee the failure of three US banks and the government-facilitated takeover of a fourth in Europe.\n\nBut now he sees signs of distress virtually everywhere. Seemingly on cue, First Republic Bank’s deposit outflows and earnings shattered a fragile calm this week.\n\nSimilar to the regional lenders who suffered an exodus of depositors, insurers could struggle to manage so-called lapse risk, the rate of policyholders cashing-in or not renewing contracts.\n\n“I’ve been approached by funds that want to compare notes on the risk of misjudging policy lapse, where life insurance companies can have issues on the liability side which can cause concern around their assets,” he said. “In a downturn, I foresee this CDS widening a lot more than other sectors and along with regional banks, life insurance sector getting the most scrutiny about the marks.”\n\nFive-year default protection on investment-grade rated Lincoln National Corp. has spiked to around 335 basis points since the bank turmoil erupted — and unlike broader CDS gauges, never recovered. In an April 5 tweet, Weinstein said he holds default protection on Lincoln and also recently sold some.\n\nShadow lenders that amassed huge bets on illiquid, unrated companies in the cheap money era are another target. Last quarter was the busiest January through March stretch for US bankruptcy courts since 2009, according to data on large corporate filings compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nIn the private space, problems are often masked because prices aren’t marked to market as often if at all.\n\n“I think there’s going to be a huge problem in private credit in the next year,” Weinstein warned. “Some investors talk about how great it is to be able to buy 11% yielding secured loans as if it’s an amazing environment. Tell that to those companies that have to pay so much more in interest expense.”\n\nDire Warnings\n\nThe bond market contains dire warnings about the state of the economy, Weinstein said. Virtually the entire Treasury curve remains inverted and yields aren’t far from levels reached in the aftermath of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.\n\nBut with equities and credit sedate by comparison, and an economy and labor markets that remain robust, bets on an imminent downturn may backfire.\n\nThe VIX Index of US stock volatility has tumbled to below 20 from 26 during the bank turmoil. In credit, US investment-grade corporate bond spreads are signaling the all-clear, with risk premiums narrowing more than 20 basis points from their March peak.\n\nMost tail-risk strategies use deep out-of-the-money puts on the S&P 500 index or calls on the VIX, rather than the credit-default swaps favored by Saba.\n\nWeinstein argues that in a slow-burn bear market, credit derivatives are less dependent on the timing of a crash and bets on specific names may capture volatility spikes better than classic Black Swan strategies, whose returns have mostly stalled since the big pandemic selloff.\n\nHe acknowledges the tail-risk proposition is likely to suffer in a bull market, especially one boosted by quantitative easing. Saba historically has made money when volatility has been high, but a decade-long rally in credit following the 2008 financial crisis meant fewer opportunities to profit. The Saba Capital Master fund suffered five years of losses in the period from 2010 through 2019 right before delivering its best year on record in the pandemic.\n\nIf the Federal Reserve engineers a soft landing of the US economy, the best days for tail-risk hedging may be over for now.\n\nBut for Weinstein, the full impact of the central bank’s 475 basis points of policy tightening have only begun trickling through the economy. He says that a recession is likely to happen within one year, and that a wide range of outcomes and risks are going overlooked.\n\n“There’s a fog of uncertainty” he said. “When the fog clears, prices will better reflect fundamental value again.”\n\n--With assistance from Claire Boston.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n©2023 Bloomberg L.P."

Montana’s governor is asking lawmakers to expand the state’s proposed TikTok ban to more social media companies that provide certain data to foreign adversaries. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nMontana’s governor is asking lawmakers to expand the state’s proposed TikTok ban to more social media companies that provide certain data to foreign adversaries.\n\nEarlier this month, state lawmakers passed a bill that would make Montana the first state in the U.S. with a total ban on the popular social media platform. That would go much further than similar bans already in place in many other states and the federal government that bar the use of TikTok on government-issued devices.\n\nSimilar to many national lawmakers and government officials, proponents of the law in Montana have claimed the Chinese government could harvest U.S. user data from TikTok and use the platform to push pro-Beijing misinformation or messages to the public. TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese tech giant ByteDance, has said it has never been asked to hand over its data, and has been vigorously opposing the legislation.\n\nUnder the recently-passed bill, downloading TikTok would be illegal in Montana. And any “entity” — an app store or TikTok — would be fined $10,000 a day for each time someone accesses TikTok, “is offered the ability” to access the platform or downloads the app.\n\nBut enforcing the ban is expected to be challenging. Tech experts say there’s nothing incentivizing the companies that would be liable for violation, such as app store leaders Apple and Google, as well as TikTok, to comply. And any enforcement measures could be bypassed using a VPN, which can alter IP addresses and allows users to evade content restrictions.\n\nThe legislation was also expected to face legal hurdles on First Amendment grounds as well as “bills of attainder” laws prohibiting the government from imposing a punishment on a specific entity without a formal trial. A spokesperson for Republican Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte said the amendment offered by the governor’s office sought to deal with some of the concerns raised with the original bill.\n\nUnder the changes, social media apps that provide personal users information to “a person or entity located within a country designated as a foreign adversary” would also be barred from operating in Montana, according to a draft of the legislation shared with The Associated Press.\n\nStory continues\n\n“The amendment for consideration seeks to improve the bill by broadening Montanans’ privacy protections beyond just TikTok and against all foreign adversaries, while also addressing the bill’s technical and legal concerns,” Kaitlin Price, the governor’s press secretary, said in a statement.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported on the amendment.\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But a representative for NetChoice, a trade group that counts Google and TikTok as its members, said in a statement that the bill is still misguided.\n\n“Once again, focusing on the country of origin is still the wrong approach. This whole issue distracts us from the real threats happening around us all the time,” said Carl Szabo, the vice president and general counsel for the group.\n\n“If we truly care about protecting all Americans online, Congress needs to work on a federal data privacy law that preempts state law, among other components,\" Szabo said. \"That’s hard work, but that is what needs to be done.”\n\nLawmakers would have to approve the governor's amendment before the legislative session ends in early May."

Many of these companies increased their dividends every year for decades after he bought them.\n\nThere’s no doubt Reid’s investments were savvy. But his results are a testament to his patience more than anything else. They call to mind an old Warren Buffett observation that “the stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.”\n\nYou may be thinking that you don’t have decades to wait, as Reid did. But investors today have one advantage he couldn’t dream of.\n\nGiving Ordinary Investors a Shot at Pre-IPO Glory\n\nFor 79 years, if you wanted to invest in early-stage companies like Apple Inc. in the 1970s, Meta Platforms Inc.’s Facebook in 2004 or Airbnb Inc. in 2009, you had to be an accredited investor.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe concept came from a 1933 law that created the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which also held a provision barring any nonfounders or other company insiders from investing in a company before its initial public offering (IPO) unless they had either a consistent income of at least $200,000 or a net worth of $1 million.\n\nSee More: A Healthier Alternative to Coffee & Energy Drinks: Pureboost Gives You Energy Without The Burnout and Exhaustion\n\nIn theory, this law protected unsophisticated investors from falling for scams or pie-in-the-sky business proposals. But there’s no denying that investors like Reid were shut out from potentially lightning-fast profits for almost their entire investing lifetimes.\n\nWashington has now lifted the 79-year ban on access to pre-IPO companies — and already, thousands of regular investors are buying shares of some of the most exciting startup companies in the world today.\n\nPlatforms like StartEngine make it easy for retail investors to invest alongside venture capitalist legends like Kevin O’Leary — Shark Tank’s Mr. Wonderful — and Howard Marks, co-founder of Activision, especially for new users.\n\nIt’s not just the legal right to invest that matters — connections in the world of Silicon Valley are important, too. For example, Peter Thiel, who turned a $500,000 investment in Facebook into $1.1 billion, was acting on a tip from a network of Silicon Valley contacts it took him years to build.\n\nFor investors without the time or inclination to network like that, these platforms can offer easy access to companies that some billionaire venture capitalists are already backing. It’s possible to buy thousands of shares for just a few hundred dollars, which is important for any investors following the most basic rule of startup investing — to never risk more money than they can afford to lose.\n\nSee more on startups investing from Benzinga.\n\nDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

This initial entry into the Denver market will include the introduction of Sunset Loop Bar & Grill, a new concept curated specifically for Denver International Airport that celebrates the Mile High City's local food culture, as well as Starbucks, the beloved national coffee chain. OTG will also integrate its mobile-first technology, flo™ Xgen, within the Concourse B-East experience, which will aim to streamline travel for customers while easing operations on in-terminal restaurants.\n\nOTG x DEN Starbucks\n\n\"OTG is passionate about introducing new culinary concepts that echo the airport's sense-of-place and serve as a true extension of the community's food scene,\" said Rick Blatstein, CEO of OTG, \"We are excited to partner with local community organizations and celebrate the chefs, farmers, brewers and purveyors that have turned Denver into the mecca of culinary innovation that it is today. Coupled with OTG's technology innovations, we're confident that Concourse B-East will be both a seamless and enjoyable experience for travelers and employees alike and assist Denver International Airport with its goal of serving 100 million annual passengers.\"\n\nThe one-of-a-kind Sunset Loop Bar & Grill will be an all-day dining experience offering elevated, health-conscious cuisine and traditional American fare, with a locally sourced menu overseen by Denver-based Chef Daniel Young (\"Chef D\"). Chef D has spent the past 40 years as a leading figure in the Denver food scene and is an expert in creating healthful meals that are high in protein and low in carbs and fat. His proficiency in nutrition led him to his current role of over 15 years as the personal chef of the Denver Nuggets. He is also renowned in the community for his philanthropic efforts.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Food is my life's passion, and I'm fortunate to have built a vibrant culinary career right here in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, where we enjoy a wealth of healthy and sustainable ingredients,\" said Chef Daniel Young. \"Whether you're departing from or passing through Denver, Sunset Loop Bar & Grill will be the perfect stop along your journey to experience a delicious selection of dishes and cocktails that truly reflect this region and all the natural resources it has to offer.\"\n\nChef D's dishes will be served in an open space inspired by the Denver sunset; warm woods, rich materials and elegant brass and black metal accents are set against a hand-painted tile mural depicting the Sunset Loop trails, the restaurant's namesake series of hiking routes found in White Ranch Park in Golden, CO. The centerpiece of the restaurant will be an expansive bar with over 30 seats. There, travelers will be able to relax and indulge in signature cocktails inspired by the city, as well as a rotating menu of beers from Denver's famous craft beer scene, including Colorado Cider Company, New Belgium Brewing Company and Lone Tree Brewing.\n\nIn addition to extensive bar seating and comfortable dining tables, Sunset Loop Bar & Grill will offer a sprawling, 67-foot-long market with locally sourced products and prepared foods for travelers in a hurry, as well as an adjacent communal seating area, where guests will be able to order dishes from the restaurant's menus while waiting at nearby gates. Anchoring the corner of Sunset Loop Bar & Grill will be a signature Starbucks with a sculptural build inspired by the natural rock formations found across the Colorado mountains. This singularly designed location will be fully outfitted with mobile ordering capabilities, ultimately allowing travelers to place their coffee orders in advance and cut down on time spent waiting in line. Customers can also rest assured that their coffee is a product of responsible farming and purchasing practices and a company committed to reducing its environmental footprint.\n\n\"We are excited to partner with OTG as they bring a fun, new concept to our airport,\" said DEN Senior Vice President of Concessions Pam Dechant. \"We're always looking for ways to make traveling through DEN a breeze, and the ability to bring mobile ordering to our passengers takes service to the next level.\"\n\nOTG's new hospitality concepts within Concourse B-East will be powered by its industry-leading flo™ Xgen technology, which enables customers to place their food and beverage orders through a mobile platform across all OTG restaurants and retail markets. From wherever the order is placed, the platform's contactless payment will allow users to complete their transaction with either a credit card, Google Pay, Apple Pay, Venmo, PayPal or their United airline miles, all with one click. OTG is thrilled to introduce this best-in-class technology at DEN with the goal of providing a safe, convenient and unparalleled customer experience, along with streamlined restaurant operations that allow for greater focus on the delivery of quality dishes and exceptional service.\n\nAbout OTG\n\nOTG develops and operates restaurants, retail markets and food halls in airports throughout North America. With more than 350 locations across 22 terminals in 10 of the world's busiest travel hubs, OTG continues to elevate the passenger-terminal relationship by merging state-of-the-art technology with farm-to-terminal dining, award-winning cuisine, carefully curated food and retail options, world-class hospitality, and a striking redesign of the terminal space.

Yahoo Finance's Daniel Howley joined Brad Smith and Diane King Hall to discuss what Twitter has to say about the tech giant’s earnings call, and the future for the company’s A.I. ambitions on Yahoo Finance's After the Call.\n\nTwitter users showed “a ton of enthusiasm towards Meta,” Howley said. He explained that the positive reaction wasn’t just about the earnings but the number of times the company mentioned A.I.\n\nWall street and main street will be watching out for A.I. mentions on other big tech earnings calls to come.\n\nWatch the full show here .\n\nKey video moments:\n\n00:00:08 On Twitter response\n\n00:01:25 On analyst response\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nBRAD SMITH: We got to bring in Yahoo Finance's tech editor, Dan Howley.\n\n- Dan Howley.\n\nBRAD SMITH: [INAUDIBLE] Dan.\n\nDAN HOWLEY: Yeah, I got to tell you. I'm looking at the overall reaction on social media to this earnings call. It really seems, I mean, a lot of people being facetious saying Mark Zuckerberg could not have said the word, or I guess the letters, AI more than he did during that call. A lot of people calling out the fact that this was a beat, not necessarily a big beat. But a ton of enthusiasm seemingly towards Meta and the fact that they were able to do this after those consecutive quarters of losses. So-- or decline in revenue.\n\nSo it's not as though it's a overwhelming sense of joy. It's more along the lines of, they cannot stop talking about AI, they talk about the metaverse. Some people were saying that that's more lip service than anything. But I think overall, what we're seeing is a positive reaction to these earnings. And how that will then reflect on the broader tech sector, because look, we're through Microsoft. We're through Alphabet.\n\n- Through Alphabet.\n\nDAN HOWLEY: Amazon's coming, we got Apple coming. There's a slew of other companies. And guess what they're probably going to talk about, AI.\n\nStory continues\n\n- Yes indeed.\n\nBRAD SMITH: Dan, have there been any immediate AI-- or not AI, analyst reactions that you've seen out there so far?\n\nDAN HOWLEY: So far, it was really, from the call, I mean, a lot of folks praising Mark Zuckerberg, praising the performance of the company, and the cost-cutting measures that they've done, those layoffs, and then cutting back on capital expenditures. But I think that the conversation still has to go out and talk about how they are spending a lot of money on that metaverse. And they're going to continue to do so. Year-over-year increase in losses for the metaverse going through 2023.\n\nSo it's not as though they're lighting that money on fire. But they're cutting it in other places. That's more or less what a lot of people seem to be thinking.\n\nBRAD SMITH: Yeah, not lighting it on fire, but cutting it up and trying to tape it back together, and put it to use elsewhere. That's for sure. Dan, thanks so much for hopping in on \"After the Call\" here."

		"content": "rparobe / iStock.com\n\nIf you want to save money on your grocery bill, it’s time to look beyond your regular supermarket. That’s right, there are many places where you can buy high-quality groceries at lower prices. That way, you can enjoy the satisfaction of filling your pantry with high-quality food while still staying within your budget. Your wallet (and stomach!) will thank you.\n\nTip: Don’t Buy Groceries on These Days of the Week\n\nFind Out: How To Build Your Savings From Scratch\n\nFarmer’s Markets\n\nYou can get fresh, local, and organic produce at farmer’s markets at a fraction of the cost of a supermarket. You’ll also be supporting small farmers and reducing your carbon footprint.\n\n“Where farmers markets really shine is with fresh produce,” said Julie Ramhold, consumer analyst at DealNews.com. “Grocery stores will have produce brought in from all over the place and it may or may not be at its peak; but if you shop at farmers markets, you can take advantage of local produce that’s going to be at its best, so you’ll be supporting the local economy and getting your hands on seasonal items that should be at their peak or at least near it. Find out what’s grown in your area and try to take advantage of these markets to pick up produce and other local items, like fresh-baked goods, farm-fresh eggs, and more.”\n\nSee: 8 Best New Grocery Items at Dollar Tree To Help Combat Inflation\n\nCSAs\n\nCSA stands for Community Supported Agriculture, and it’s a great alternative to visiting a farmer’s market in person. Typically you just select what size box you’d like to receive every month, and it arrives filled with whatever fresh, local and organic produce is in season, directly from the farmers. Use LocalHarvest.org to see what’s available in your area.\n\nImperfect Foods and Misfits Market are two other options that are similar to CSAs. They both deliver produce that is good quality but are slightly blemished or oddly shaped, at a savings over the regular price. Who cares if your apple has a dent? It still keeps the doctor away!\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon\n\nYes, Amazon, the same place where you can buy books, gadgets and inflatable unicorns for the pool. You can find great deals on pantry staples and get them delivered to your door for free if you have Prime.\n\n“Even though Amazon Pantry isn’t around anymore, you can still find plenty of shelf-stable items in bulk on the site,” Ramhold said. “Very often the unit price can be far better because of that versus shopping for the same items in a standard grocery store. For example, if you want to buy something like Nature Valley Crunchy Oats ‘n Honey granola bars, you could spend around $7 for a box of 24 bars, or roughly 27 cents each. But if you shop on Amazon, you could get a package of 48 bars for around $10.49, or 22 cents per bar. That might not seem like a big difference, but these kinds of things can add up when you’re purchasing items regularly.”\n\nAlso, remember to use Subscribe & Save when available to get additional discounts on items you buy regularly. You can cancel anytime if you change your mind.\n\nMarshall’s\n\nMarshall’s offers an array of spices, sauces and other pantry essentials at a discounted price, and its inventory is constantly changing. Make sure to explore its selection the next time you need to stock up on groceries. You may even find new ingredients to inspire your cooking. And don’t forget to check out other discount stores such as Ross and T.J. Maxx for similar deals on pantry items. You never know what kind of treasure you might uncover while browsing the shelves.\n\nHomeGoods\n\nHomeGoods is more than just a destination for decorative pillows and rugs — it’s also a treasure trove for grocery deals. The store offers a surprising variety of food items including quality cooking oils, coffee, tea, baking supplies and more. At HomeGoods, you can expect to find high-quality products at affordable prices. Whether you’re looking for pantry staples or gourmet ingredients, HomeGoods has got you covered.\n\nDollar Tree\n\nDid you know that you can save a significant amount of money on packaged foods and canned goods just by visiting your local dollar store? Dollar Tree, in particular, is a great place to stock up on shelf-stable items such as canned goods.\n\n“Believe it or not, dollar stores can be a great place to shop for common grocery staples,” said Jake Hill, CEO of DebtHammer. “Canned goods and pantry items such as spices and dried pasta can often be found in these stores for far less than traditional grocery store prices. In some cases, customers can even find name-brand items at dollar store prices, which is a true bargain.”\n\nBuy Directly\n\nIt’s worth checking to see if your favorite brand offers direct-to-consumer shipping. By shopping directly from the brand’s website, you can potentially save money by cutting out the middleman.\n\nA good example is A Dozen Cousins, which offers many of its flavorful beans in a 12-pack for $45, versus $4.79 each in-store. That’s a savings of over $12 when you buy directly.\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 7 Unexpected Places To Shop and Save on Groceries"

		"content": "Fireside, the Mark Cuban-backed interactive entertainment app, has now confirmed its $25 million Series A, valuing the business at $138 million, post-money. The company had been rumored to be raising at a $125 million valuation last year, after attracting a number of high-profile creators to its streaming platform for live and virtual shows. The funding and valuation were confirmed through Fireside’s recent investor update, obtained by TechCrunch, which also mentions new strategic investors like Paris Hilton and others, and offers a first look at its interactive streaming technology for smart TVs.\n\nThe latter is made possible through last year’s acquisition of the streaming TV platform Stremium. At the time, Fireside confirmed the deal would help it to accelerate its plans, saying it would be the “only platform that turns creators, celebrities, brands and IP owners into the studio, networks and streaming services of the future.”\n\nThe company hopes to soon bring its interactive technology to smart TVs, Fire TV, Apple TV and Roku, where viewers could watch content on the big screen and engage via their phone, while their comments would display on the TV.\n\nReached for comment, Fireside confirmed the investor update’s accuracy but said it has nothing more to add at this time.\n\nThe update confirms the earlier reporting that Fireside’s Series A had closed, which it had yet to officially announce.\n\nIt also confirms the newly added strategic investors, including Paris Hilton, Tim Connors from PivotNorth, Zeke Bronfman + Evan Abraham, Redbeard Ventures and David DeVoe.\n\nThough Fireside had once been compared to other live platforms like Twitter Spaces or Clubhouse, those comparisons weren’t at all accurate. Not only does Fireside differentiate itself with its focus on streaming interactive videos, the shows on its platform can also be recorded, saved or even simulcast to other social networks.\n\nPlus, the app includes a number of audience engagement tools and other features to aid creators with promotion, editing, measurement, distribution, monetization and audience growth, which are part of its end-to-end content production experience.\n\nCo-founded by Cuban, early Yammer employee Mike Ihbe (who has since departed) and former Googler, YouTuber and Node co-founder Falon Fatemi, who sold her last company to SugarCRM, Fireside has attracted high-profile creators, including Jay Leno, Michael Dell, Melissa Rivers, Craig Kilborn and screenwriter and “Entourage” creator Doug Ellin.\n\nIn the investor update, the company also references popular Hollywood medium Tyler Henry as one of its creators, saying his network has grown to “tens of thousands of members globally” who connect with him “multiple times per month.”\n\nThe startup is also going to have a Hollywood moment of its own, as reality TV star Heather Dubrow from Bravo’s The Real Housewives of Orange County will launch a lifestyle network, the HD Network, on Fireside on May 9. That’s given Fireside a bit of a promotion as part of The Real Housewives of Orange County Season 17, where both Fatemi and Cuban will appear.\n\nAlso thanks to its integration with Stremium, Fireside will be onboarding other partners to its platform. The deal brings “over 100 new networks” with “24/7 broadcasting live interactive programming.” This includes names like USA Today, ArtFlix Movie Classics, Billiard, Boxing, Ted Talks, Docurama, English Football, eSports, Global Fashion Channel, InspireFlix, Law & Crime, MMA and others.\n\nThese channels will have an “On Now” indicator in the Fireside app, allowing users to watch alongside other audience members and react and comment.\n\nThis technology is something that’s been popular in other streaming apps outside the U.S., like Rakuten’s Viki, which allows users to watch and react to shows in real time. More recently, a new streaming service Mansa, focused on Black culture, added a similar feature.\n\nThe investor update also mentioned that talent, brands and IP owners can make a minimum of $35 million in annual recurring net new revenue stream in their first year on Fireside. The company said it’s now seeing a “minimum of $100K” within the first hours of a stream’s launch.\n\nCreators are able to monetize their shows by selling tickets or inserting advertising. The company had also explored web3 technologies, like NFTs — though those were not referenced in this latest update.\n\nIn addition to Cuban himself, other investors in Fireside include the Chainsmokers, HBSE, Goodwater, Animal Capital, NFL stars Larry Fitzgerald (retired) and Kelvin Beachum, and former NBA star Baron Davis. The company says it’s aiming to reach profitability this year and is being evaluated for a Series B where it will look to include international strategic investors in order to expand globally."

		"content": "Christopher Giancarlo, the former chairman of the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission, expressed his disappointment in Washington’s hostility towards cryptocurrency in an interview with Forkast for an upcoming Word on the Block episode.\n\n“We are, in the United States, like deer caught in the headlights, at least in the official sector, because of these transformative, challenging new technologies,” said Giancarlo.\n\nAccording to Giancarlo, Washington regulators are unfriendly towards decentralized technologies because they threaten the existing financial system. He called for the U.S. to stop resisting crypto innovation and view it as an opportunity to reset the financial system in a more democratic and financially inclusive way.\n\nHis comments come in light of recent regulatory actions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission following the collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange. The SEC has since been cracking down on exchanges and trading platforms, including legal actions against Coinbase, Kraken and Bittrex.\n\n“The scandal of FTX is entirely a Washington scandal,” said Giancarlo.\n\nSee related article: Bankrupt FTX recovers US$7.3 billion in assets, considers resurrection of operations\n\n“I’ve recently been in Sao Paulo, Brazil, I was in Europe, I was in Japan talking to financial regulators there [and] they’re not overly focused on FTX. They’re focused on the opportunities that are coming with this technology and how to further their own economic interests,” he added.\n\nHe said the U.S. crypto crackdown is as an administration policy carried out by regulatory agencies.\n\nBoth the CFTC and SEC are not agencies of the executive branch. They are independent agencies that report to both Congress and the White House.\n\n“I do find they are acting, certainly in the case of the SEC, as if they are actually executive branch agencies carrying out administration policy,” Giancarlo said.\n\nGovernment interest in cryptocurrencies accelerated in 2019 after social media titan Meta, then known as Facebook, announced its now-defunct Libra (later renamed Diem), a project intended to develop a digital currency for billions of its users.\n\nStory continues\n\nFacebook’s plans raised red flags among financial regulators around the world, including the U.S.\n\n“The idea that we are going to turn over our financial data and information to that company, I think they have a big uphill effort to try to convince Americans that they ought to trust in Facebook’s proprietary interest in keeping your data secret,” Congresswoman Maxine Waters said at the time.\n\nThe Diem project highlighted concerns about the possibility of technology companies replacing traditional central banks and the privacy risks involved. This in turn accelerated discussions among governments about developing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), including in the European Union and the U.S.\n\nThere are now at least 114 countries that are exploring development of sovereign digital currencies, according to the Atlantic Council, a U.S.-based think tank.\n\nHowever, like Diem, the idea of a government-controlled digital dollar in the U.S. has raised privacy concerns around population surveillance.\n\n“That’s a legitimate concern,” said Giancarlo, who is also a co-founder of the U.S.-based Digital Dollar Foundation, a non-profit that advocates for research and public discussion on the advantages and challenges of a CBDC, according to its website.\n\n“That’s why [we have to] reaffirm our First Amendment rights, reaffirm our Fourth Amendment rights and demand that, whether digital currency is [developed] by government or the private sector, there must be no way to have individual surveillance,” he said."

		"content": "NEW YORK, April 26, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The preschool or childcare market in China is set to grow by USD 7,738.18 million from 2022 to 2027, progressing at a CAGR of 11.22% during the forecast period. The report offers an up-to-date analysis regarding the current market scenario, the latest trends and drivers, and the overall market environment. The market is driven by the rising demand for sustained enrollment. The Chinese government does not facilitate subsidized education in preschools or kindergartens. However, there has been a rise in demand for preschool education in the country. The increase in disposable income has created a demand for preschool services in China. This has encouraged many local and international players to invest in this market and tap the growth potential. Vendors are opening new branches to capture market share and remain competitive in the market. All these factors drive the growth of the preschool or childcare market in China. Get a comprehensive report summary describing the market size and forecast along with research methodology. Download Sample Report in minutes!\n\nTechnavio has announced its latest market research report titled China Preschool or Childcare Market 2023-2027\n\nPreschool Or Childcare Market in China 2023-2027 - Market Dynamics\n\nKey Trend – The growing number of dual-income households is identified as the key trend in the market. China has witnessed a considerable increase in the number of working women in recent years. According to the World Bank Group, in 2020, women constituted almost 43.71% of the labor force in China. Women in the country are moving from tier-2 cities to tier-1 cities seeking better opportunities. The rise in the number of working women has increased the number of dual-income households. This is increasing the spending capacity of people, which has enhanced the number of student enrollments. In addition, parents in China are becoming increasingly aware of the benefits of sending children to preschools for learning activities. These factors are positively influencing the growth of the market.\n\nMajor Challenge – The increased cost of raising children will challenge the growth of the market. The cost of raising a child in China is significantly higher than in the US and Japan. The high expense of child-raising has drastically reduced birth rates in the country. The increase in education fees discourages many parents to enroll their children in preschools or childcare centers. Such factors are negatively affecting the growth of the market in focus.\n\nStory continues\n\nPreschool or Childcare Market in China 2023-2027: Market Segmentation\n\nThe preschool or childcare market in China is segmented by service (full-time preschool or childcare and on-demand preschool or childcare), age group (children aged below 3 years, children aged between 3 and 6 years), and ownership (public preschool or childcare and private preschool or childcare).\n\nThe market growth in the full-time preschool or childcare segment will be significant during the forecast period. Many parents in China are becoming aware of the importance of full-time preschools, as they help in shaping up personalities of their children better than on-demand preschools. In addition, various vendors in the preschool or childcare market in China offer services with several facilities that focus on learning as well as the overall personality development of children. These factors drive the growth of the segment.\n\nThe report comprises of various segments as well as analysis of the trends and factors that are playing a substantial role in the market - View a Sample Report\n\nThe preschool or childcare market in China covers the following areas:\n\nCompanies Mentioned\n\n3e International School - The company offers child-initiated dual language activities for children.\n\nBeanstalk Education Group - The company offers solutions for preschool or childcare, providing young learners with a well-rounded international education that integrates Chinese and Western educational philosophies, cultural elements, and best practices.\n\nCanadian International School of Beijing - The company offers preschool experimental activities, food offerings, libraries, online resources, and smart card entries.\n\nCrestar Education Group - The company offers solutions for preschool or childcare, which include dance, speech and drama, language, music, art, abacus, math, and Chinese language tuition.\n\nEtonkids International Educational Group\n\nFortune Kindergarten\n\nGolden Apple Education Investment Group Co.

		"content": "VettaFi Financial Futurist Dave Nadig joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss buying opportunities in the tech sector.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- The tech sector, ending the day high, are on some positive earnings results from Microsoft and Alphabet. And Meta popping in after hours trading after beating on the top and the bottom line, a pretty solid beat. Check out shares, up more than 12% after hours. Tech been on a wild ride so far this year with double digit gains for some of the biggest players. So how can you position your portfolio to ride the highs of these stocks? For that, we turn to Dave Nadig, VettaFi financial futurist as part of our ETF report brought to you by Invesco QQQ. Good to see you, sir. You heard the question. How can you ride this wave?\n\nDAVE NADIG: Well, it's been a really fascinating thing to watch because I think we've got this bifurcated market. There's part of it that is driven by consumers. And when we're talking about the tech story, it's really a consumer tech story. The big tech spends on things like CapEx investment, we're not seeing those kinds of big top line earnings hits that we'd love to see. We're seeing Microsoft, Apple, Google, Meta, those are where the action really is. Those are consumer technology plays of a sort.\n\nAnd that's where we've seen a lot of the activity. If you look at across different sectors, we recently at VettaFi picked up a company called Logically which lets us dig down into the portfolios of ETFs and figure out what's driving their returns, the biggest winner this year has been QUAL, which is the iShares quality factor ETF. When you look at what it holds and what's driving the pattern of returns in it, it's communication services, it's technology companies, it's better picks in the consumer discretionary space. That's what's driving these funds to gain assets, but also to beat the market. QUAL is beating S&P by about 1.5% so far this year.\n\n- Dave, do you think that momentum, though, can continue? And how much of it is a result of all this hype around AI? Meta reported tonight and it was in their second line of this release.\n\nStory continues\n\nDAVE NADIG: Well, I think AI is a lot more real than it is hype, even how much hype there is. Not because we're all going to go buy something with AI on the label and we're going to spend a lot of money. It's going to allow businesses to really change how they do business in a positive way. It speeds up time to market, it speeds up product development, it makes marketing better and more targeted. There are real use cases here that are driving real flows.\n\n- When it comes to some of the other sectors that we have heard from so far, the consumer staples stocks have reported over the last week. We heard from PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, Procter and Gambel, just to name a few. How are you looking at investment opportunities within that sector?\n\nDAVE NADIG: Well, it's worth pointing out that staples and discretionary had a really flipped year last year where staples did quite well, discretionary really took it on the chin. That's flipped around a bit. Staples is actually dragging down the S&P so far this year. Discretionary is really leading.\n\nBut even saying that, if you look inside the staples earnings reports, we see a consistent theme of price over volume, meaning everything from Tootsie Roll to Kimberly-Clark to Pepsi seems to be able to pass not only their increased costs onto consumers, but to juice their margins along the way. We've seen no evidence yet that the average consumer is pulling back their spending just because prices are up.\n\n- You don't see the beginning of some consumer pushback saying, OK, this might be our tipping point? We've started to see some commentary in quarterly earnings reports that suggests that's just beginning to appear.\n\nDAVE NADIG: I mean, I think people should be concerned about that. Prices won't be inelastic forever. At some point, the consumer will respond. What we're finding out is, there was room to raise prices and that's what companies have done.\n\n- And so how do you benefit-- how do you invest off of what you're seeing from the consumer?\n\nDAVE NADIG: Well, I think the kinds of stocks that you're in matter. If you look at the kind of flows that we've been watching at VettaFi, we're seeing a ton of focus on what I would call safety plays but still in equity. Whether it's things like QUAL, which has pulled in a lot of money, or the JPMorgan equity and premium income fund, JEPI-- I think it's the second or third largest growing fund this year so far-- dividend strategies, like the Schwab dividend fund, SCHD-- all pulling in good flows for good reason. They're investing in the companies that are most benefiting from this price over volume mix or by being in the right place at the right time, owning, for instance, a lot of Meta.\n\n- Are you seeing-- we ask this probably too much-- is there any sign at all of a recession? Or is it complete lack thereof? We've got a tight labor market and-- I already cut you off. Go ahead.\n\nDAVE NADIG: No, no, no. It's all good. I think there are concerns, but I think the concerns are mostly on the corporate side, not on the consumer side. I'm worried about things like the credit crunch actually clamping down on CapEx. I'm worried about business growth. Those things can really hurt the economy. But the core S&P 500 companies can actually do pretty well while we're still in a recession in other parts of the economy.\n\nThat's a bit of a bifurcated market. It's not something we see very often, but that's the kind of recession I think we're headed into if it is a recession. If the consumer gets really spooked and starts keeping all their money in money market funds because we don't use banks anymore apparently, then we should be concerned. But we really don't see it in the sentiment numbers or in the actual volume numbers.\n\n- AAA said international travel is up 300%. I say the consumer's doing all right.\n\nDAVE NADIG: Yeah, travel, services, across the board.\n\n- Remarkable. Dave Nadig, good to see you, sir.\n\nDAVE NADIG: Thanks for having me.\n\n-Thanks so much."

And we talked about AI,\" according to CNN and Politico.\n\nEarlier this month, Schumer, a Democrat, said he had launched an effort to establish rules on artificial intelligence to address national security and education concerns, as use of programs like ChatGPT becomes widespread.\n\nSchumer said he had drafted and circulated a \"framework that outlines a new regulatory regime that would prevent potentially catastrophic damage to our country while simultaneously making sure the U.S. advances and leads in this transformative technology.\"\n\nIn March, Musk and a group of artificial intelligence experts and industry executives called for a six-month pause in developing systems more powerful than OpenAI's newly launched GPT-4, in an open letter citing potential risks to society.\n\n\"Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable,\" said the letter issued by the Future of Life Institute.\n\nThere is a growing push in Washington for AI regulations. Senate Intelligence Committee chair Mark Warner, a Democrat, sent major AI CEOs a letter Wednesday asking them to take steps to address concerns.\n\nCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, a Democrat, told reporters Wednesday the Biden administration is working \"as aggressively as possible to figure out our approach\" to AI.\n\n\"The challenge is you don't want to stifle innovation in a brand new area with massive potential,\" Raimondo said. \"The risks related to misinformation and deep fakes etcetera are massive.\"\n\nIn January, Musk met two top White House officials in Washington to discuss how Tesla and the administration of President Joe Biden could work together to advance electric vehicle production. He also visited with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, in a meeting earlier this year.\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Cynthia Osterman, Stephen Coates and Chris Reese)"

		"content": "LG has officially launched the SuperSlim, the new Gram laptop the company is calling the “thinnest LG Gram ever.” This is not just advertising hyperbole, as the SuperSlim is .43-inches thick and weighs two pounds. That definitely places the laptop in the realm of the ultra-portable. As a comparison, the 2022 Macbook Air is 0.44-inches thick and weighs 2.7 pounds.\n\nThe laptop was first teased at this year’s CES, back when it was called the Ultraslim. Not a lot has changed since the original announcement, aside from the name. The SuperSlim boasts decent specs, with an Intel Evo 13th Gen processor and Intel Iris Xe GPU. There is also a 15.6-inch anti-glare OLED display and LG touts a 100 percent DCI-P33 color gamut and VESA DisplayHDR True Black integration. It is worth noting that Apple is rumored to be launching its own 15-inch ultra-portable laptop in the near future.\n\nLG says the SuperSlim has passed seven tests to ensure military-grade durability, which is a good thing as we have noted some issues with previous Gram laptops surrounding flexibility and build quality. Other standout features include a more compact power adapter than previous Gram laptops, a full HD camera with integrated microphones and a trio of USB-C ports, two of which support Thunderbolt 4 connections.\n\nThis emaciated wonder is available now in two SKUs. You can purchase one with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $1,700 or a model with 32GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD for $2,000. As a bonus, LG is throwing in a free Gram +view portable monitor with every purchase until May 14th.\n\nAll products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

		"content": "More than half (53%) report their personal financial situation has deteriorated, so they are rethinking their emergency saving goals and turning to family and friends for support\n\nMENLO PARK, Calif., April 26, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Quicken Inc., maker of America's best-selling personal finance software, today shared findings from a survey that explored people's perceptions of their financial health amidst the current economic climate and its impact on their spending and saving.\n\nQuicken Logo (PRNewsfoto/Quicken)\n\n\"The past year has been topsy-turvy for consumers from an economic perspective, so we wanted to take the temperature of how people are feeling about their financial health and spending power,\" said Eric Dunn, CEO of Quicken. \"With more than half reporting that their financial situation has deteriorated in the past 12 months, we found that many are prioritizing saving for their emergency fund while considering cutting down on expenses like streaming services, retail, and restaurants.\"\n\nPeople are adjusting their financial habits as a result of the economic conditions\n\nThe past year has seen rising prices and inflation , waves of layoffs , and warnings of a forthcoming recession. As a result, half (51%) of survey respondents feel anxious when thinking about the current economic situation, with nearly half (48%) feeling frustrated and nearly a third (31%) scared.\n\nThe challenging economic climate is impacting consumers' financial power and decision-making when it comes to their money. Two-thirds of people had to take financially restrictive actions over the last 12 months, including delaying a big purchase (29%), pushing out vacation or travel plans (27%), selling possessions (18%), dipping into a 401K (16%), liquidating investments (15%), stopping using a credit card (15%), or picking up an extra job (11%). As one respondent noted, \"I am buying less because everything is so much more expensive.\" It's no surprise, considering more than half of consumers (53%) ranked inflation as their biggest concern among inflation, layoffs, interest rates and stock market performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nEmergency funds coming into focus\n\nTwo-thirds (66%) of people say that the current economic situation has made them rethink how much they should have in an emergency fund, and they are trying to increase their savings as a result. Emergency funds are especially on the minds of those who have been laid off in the past 12 months, with 90% saying that the current economy has made them rethink how much they should have in an emergency fund, compared to 72% of those who have not been laid off. One respondent commented, \"We will have to really cut back and focus on saving till we get back on our feet.\"\n\nWhen looking across the generations, millennials have seen their emergency funds drop most significantly in the past year. The number of millennials with more than four months of emergency funds has decreased by 11% over the last twelve months, compared to Gen Z, where that number has increased by 7%. Those with more than four months of emergency savings in Gen X and Boomer generations have remained stable.\n\nHousing is currently a challenge, especially for those who have recently experienced a layoff\n\nWhen it comes to housing, which is traditionally one of people's largest expenses, one in four (28%) say that their current financial situation has adversely changed their housing situation. This reality is heightened for those who have been laid off in the last year (55%). Thirty-seven percent of those laid off in the last twelve months have had to move due to their current financial situation, whether to a new home or apartment, or a new city or state, compared to only 9% of those not laid off.\n\nA significant portion of Gen Z (54%) and millennials (43%) say that their current financial situation has adversely changed their housing situation (compared to 33% of Gen X and 9% of Boomers). Out of those adversely affected in their housing situation by their current finances, 38% say they want to be financially cautious now due to current economic conditions/inflation. Another third (35%) say rising interest rates have priced them out of the home market.\n\nMore layoffs would cause people to make additional spending cuts\n\nAs people contemplate what their financial health would look like amid a layoff, many expect to make spending cuts in other categories they typically spend money in. If laid off, the top four things that consumers would first consider giving up include streaming services (49%), clothes and accessories (42%), dining out (40%), and travel (40%). Additionally, for those with kids, over half (56%) would give up or consider giving up childcare services in the event of layoffs. Pet owners are more reluctant, with only 38% reporting that they would be willing to cut back on pet-related expenses.\n\nDunn added, \"As consumers curb their spending in areas like entertainment, dining, and travel, we may see corporate cost-cutting spread to those industries, extending 2023's trail of layoffs and resulting economic challenges.\"\n\nBut despite economic hardships, people are willing to lend a helping hand\n\nThere's a silver lining for those who have been recently laid off. Nearly half (46%) of respondents who had been laid off in the past 12 months report that friends or family have given or lent them money. And 2 in 5 have had their friends or family provide support services like paying for a meal or babysitting their children.\n\nA third (33%) of people who haven't been laid off in the past year have offered, given, or lent money to someone negatively affected by layoffs or the current economic climate. Those who have helped someone who was negatively affected are twice as likely to feel excited (13%) about the current economic situation than those who haven't helped someone (5%). Similarly, those who have helped are twice as likely to see opportunity when looking at the current economic situation (13% vs. 6%).\n\nTo help track and manage your financial health, visit www.quicken.com .\n\nMethodology: This SurveyMonkey online poll was conducted in March 2023.

		"content": "The basic principle of Moore’s law — computing becoming more powerful yet more compact — is playing out in a number of fields, and one of the latest is coming from the world of audiology technology.\n\nTympaHealth, a London startup that has developed handheld hardware built around streamlined iPhone and Android devices, and corresponding software, to run hearing tests — tests would have previously required specialists, a range of larger and more expensive equipment and purpose-built clinics — has raised $23 million in funding to expand its business.\n\nOctopus Ventures is leading the round, with participation also from new backers Dara Capital, Rezayat Investments and serial entrepreneurs Bob Davis and Jeff Leerink (as well as previous backers).\n\nNotably, the startup raised an $8 million seed round in February 2022 from a well-connected set of individuals that included the VC Jim Breyer, the former head of Apple Health Anil Sethi and others; it’s not disclosing which previous backers are participating in this latest Series A.\n\nFigures in PitchBook put it’s valuation at around $62-$65 million with this latest funding, but founder and CEO Dr Krishan Ramdoo, tells us pre-money valuation is closer to $70 million. (The market is tough for startups raising right now, so the more modest numbers are not too surprising.)\n\nThe funding is going to be used in its home market and also in the U.S., where Tympa believes it has a big opportunity to provide an easier route to hearing tests in a market where hearing aids are going to become much more widely available, thanks to new FDA rules that will allow them to be sold without a prescription, over the counter.\n\nSo far, the company has been seeing some interesting traction. In the U.K., more than 250,000 patients have had their hearing tested with its devices across audiology labs, but also hundreds of pharmacies (including major chains like Boots), care homes and clinics.\n\nAlthough Tympa was originally hatched in an NHS incubator, ironically most of its users to date have been through private (that is, paid) visits.\n\nPart of that may be down to the price and business model around the product: The hardware and software are both sold on a SaaS model: there is a standalone training and set-up fee that is not disclosed (it will vary depending on the business size and more), and then there is a £200 per month fee for access to the hardware and software. Users sign three-year contracts with one-year break clauses. Customers then are typically charged £50-60 per assessment (so that means four customers per month to break even). But with GPs no longer offering services like hearing assessments, and users might otherwise require referrals that take time to action, Tympa’s customers are seeing more customers than this on average.\n\nWith this positive track record, Tympa is also now starting to work with NHS trusts, too (where the tests will be subsidized by the country’s health service).\n\n“Using a high-quality product and a proposition geared around the consumer, they are reducing the burden of ear and hearing care in an overstretched NHS, while vastly improving patient experience and outcomes,” said Joe Stringer, a partner at Octopus Ventures, in a statement.\n\nIn the U.S., where Tympa has already received FDA approval, it has also been running a trial ahead of a wider business development push. Prices in the U.S. are likely to be higher due to how insurance works in that country.\n\nRamdoo is a former ear, nose and throat surgeon, and he said that he started the company out of his direct experience with encountering patients who were not getting regular check-ups for their hearing, and were missing out on getting issues like hearing loss, or even just excessive wax build up, identified and addressed in a timely way.\n\nRamdoo was working in the U.K.’s National Health Service at the time, and while the organization has a strong reputation for providing socialized medicine to U.K. residents, it’s also been trying to lean into more innovative practices. One of those was building an in-house incubator, where Ramdoo started work on his concept.\n\nThe device it’s built is based around a smartphone — currently it has a version that works with an Android device and a version that is based around an iPhone — but essentially the phone is no longer a phone: the startup has developed apps for iOS and Android that run on the devices.\n\nThose devices are in turn integrated into a larger piece of hardware, a shell of sorts with an improved lens and otoscope to probe into an ear, a processing unit to gather and organize the data — running machine learning and algorithms to determine conclusions from the diagnostics — and a micro-suction system, which can remove wax in the ear.\n\nI thought it was interesting how far Tympa had doctored — so to speak — these smartphones. Ramdoo said that they’d reached out to both companies, and neither had any issue with how the startup was tweaking their devices, nor have they made efforts — yet — to get more involved with what they’re doing.\n\nThat will be something to watch. Although we have not heard (pun intended) much about what Google and Apple are doing in the area of audiology, both have a strong interest building out a deeper set of services in the area of health.\n\nBoth Apple and Google have worked with other hearing technology specialists — Denmark’s GN Hearing has worked with both companies to build hearing aid devices and related technology that work more seamlessly with their smartphones. And while current economic tides, and perhaps other projects, may mean that moonshots are getting less attention and funding — the last big updates from Google’s Project Wolverine were in March 2021, for example — Ramdoo believes that they are still in the pipeline.\n\n“The idea of iPods as hearing aids is coming,” he said.\n\nIn the meantime, he said that all the major companies building audiology technology are in touch, too, potentially for better data integrations and maybe also, down the line, to develop more personalized and sophisticated hearing technology based on the diagnostics that Tympa is able to collect.\n\n“We’re bringing more people into the funnel who will need more hearing aids,” Ramdoo said. Previously, all of the different ecosystems that were focused on hearing — from clinicians through to those making hearing aids, to the hospitals and care homes that were the first port of entry for patients — were all in silos, he added. “We are helping to collect all that data under one umbrella.”\n\nUpdated with more detail on valuation and to correct the pricing details."

		"content": "(Bloomberg) -- The US economy’s first-quarter report card and separate assessments of labor costs, spending and inflation in coming days are projected to keep the Federal Reserve tilted toward another interest-rate hike next week.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe data are likely to present a picture of an economy that started the year strong — driven largely by a January surge in consumer spending — before losing momentum. Inflation, however, will still be roughly double the Fed’s target, underpinned by resilient demand for services and strong wage growth.\n\nThe reports surface less than a week before Fed policymakers meet on May 2-3 to consider another quarter percentage-point increase in their benchmark interest rate.\n\nHere’s what to watch for in the key reports released Thursday and Friday:\n\nFirst-Quarter GDP\n\nGross domestic product is expected to have risen at a 2% annualized rate, primarily driven by what will likely be the strongest quarter for personal spending in nearly two years. That said, Thursday’s report will obscure the evolution of activity in the first quarter.\n\nWhile the year started with a bang, partly reflecting unseasonably warm weather, household spending lost steam as the quarter progressed.\n\nInventories are expected to be a notable drag on GDP, reflecting a slower build compared to the prior period. Residential investment will likely also weigh on the figure, given the battered housing market. Business investment is seen as tepid, according to the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow estimate.\n\nEconomists at Wells Fargo & Co. warned in a note Wednesday that the government’s latest annual revisions to retail sales could be a “game-changer” and now expect consumer spending to increase at a 2.6% rate — down from 4.4% — in the first quarter. The revisions released earlier this week showed the change in sales was stronger in December than previously reported but weaker in January and February.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe GDP report is significant in that it will also offer data-watchers a sneak peak into Friday’s key monthly inflation and spending figures for March.\n\nPCE Deflators\n\nSimilar to the consumer price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation metrics on Friday will likely show some signs of moderation last month but also areas of underlying strength, notably on the services side.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues have emphasized the importance of looking at services inflation, excluding energy and housing, to assess price pressures. Bloomberg Economics anticipates this “supercore” measure accelerated in March, increasing pressure on the Fed to hike rates another quarter point next week.\n\nExcluding food and energy, the so-called core personal consumption expenditures price index is expected to increase another 0.3%. Meantime, headline inflation will likely be flattered by lower energy prices and is expected to increase just 0.1% — the smallest advance since July.\n\nThe expected advance in the PCE price index on a year-over-year basis should slow markedly since the gauge in March 2022 reflected a spike in energy prices immediately after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe report also provides data on inflation-adjusted consumer spending, which probably fell 0.1% in March on softer demand for merchandise. Should that stagnation in spending continue — like the Fed’s Beige Book survey of regional business contacts recently pointed out — economic growth will be in a precarious position.\n\nEmployment Costs\n\nAlso on Friday, and arguably the most important release of the week, is the employment cost index — a favored measure of compensation among economists, especially those at the Fed. It’s anticipated to have increased 1.1% in the first three months of the year, a slight acceleration from the prior period.\n\n“The ECI release is really key for the Fed in terms of understanding how the feedback loop is from employment back to inflation more generally,” said Wells Fargo economist Shannon Seery.\n\nThe metric takes into account benefits as well wages and salaries, and — unlike the earnings figures in the monthly jobs report — is not distorted by employment shifts among occupations or industries. By that monthly measure, wage growth has moderated recently. Yet, another metric calculated by the Atlanta Fed points to a re-acceleration in pay gains.\n\nIn that way, the ECI report will offer Fed officials a more decisive indication of wage growth and its trajectory. Should there be any surprises on the ECI or on the core PCE price index, Deutsche Bank AG economists said that is “sure to be reflected” in the central bank’s messaging next week.\n\n--With assistance from Kristy Scheuble.\n\n(Adds new analysis from Wells Fargo)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n©2023 Bloomberg L.P."

		"content": "The Skyhigh Cloud Platform Simplifies the Adoption of SSE with Unified Protection at Every Control Point\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, April 26, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--RSA CONFERENCE 2023 – Skyhigh Security today announced the addition of several new capabilities to its Security Service Edge (SSE) portfolio at RSA Conference 2023. The features and functionality converged in the Skyhigh Cloud Platform reinforce Skyhigh Security’s mission to protect the world’s data with an easy to use, customer-first approach. RSA 2023 attendees can join Skyhigh Security at the Moscone Center in San Francisco in booth #S-4332.\n\nAccording to The Data Dilemma: Cloud Adoption and Risk Report, on average, organizations store 61% of their sensitive data in the cloud, a 48% increase from 2019. Most have also experienced at least one cybersecurity breach (90%), threat (89%) and/or theft of data (80%), demonstrating that on-premise data loss prevention (DLP) is not enough. Organizations need to address data security gaps by investing in comprehensive data protection that provides hybrid workforces with a secure and productive user experience.\n\nThe Skyhigh SSE Portfolio includes Skyhigh Secure Web Gateway (SWG), Skyhigh Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), Skyhigh Private Access and other products, integrated into its comprehensive Skyhigh Cloud Platform, with Data Loss Prevention (DLP) as a core capability. It protects data and stops threats across all websites, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) environments and Shadow IT, from a single, cloud-native enforcement point.\n\nGartner research shows that by 2026, 85% of organizations will seek to procure a CASB, SWG or ZTNA access offerings and obtain these from a converged solution.\n\nModernizing Data Protection\n\nThe exposure of data across a hybrid environment, combined with the lack of comprehensive visibility, can make it difficult for organizations to accurately assess their data security posture management. Skyhigh Security continues to support today’s organizations dealing with fast-paced changes that require visibility and control of sensitive data—in motion, in use, and at rest.\n\nStory continues\n\nNew features include:\n\nUnparalleled Scale and Speed Using Enhanced Exact Data Match (EDM): Unified across and included in the Skyhigh Security portfolio, EDM prevents sensitive data from being lost or stolen using precise content match criteria with a single DLP classification to fingerprint the data from a structured source in any language. It can scan up to six billion cells within six hours, which is significantly faster than anything on the market, to prevent data exfiltration and significantly reduce false positives and negatives—providing the highest level of compliance for regulated industries.\n\nUnified Data Protection of Microsoft 365 Across the Web and Cloud: Available for cloud now, and coming to web, Skyhigh Security will provide unified data protection of documents and files containing Microsoft Purview Information Protection labels for Microsoft 365 seamlessly across Skyhigh SWG and Skyhigh CASB. With Skyhigh DLP, users can detect Microsoft Purview labels, decrypt encrypted files and emails, and apply labels as response actions.\n\nAddition of Remote Browser Isolation (RBI) to CASB and ZTNA: Prevents unknown threats from ever reaching endpoints based on DLP and real-time telemetry from over one billion sensors. With RBI for CASB Sanctioned SaaS Apps, remote users and contractors can safely access any cloud app from unmanaged devices, blocking file uploads or downloads and restricting copy/paste/print activities. RBI for Private Access allows remote users to securely access private applications behind the network via RBI, for the secure access of private apps.\n\nNext Gen Skyhigh Policy Builder: Allows administrators to create and maintain policies, including customer rules and rule sets, using a new user interface. Network administrators can leverage Web Policy Builder to configure rules and rule sets, create and manage custom rules, and migrate SWG on-premise web policies to the SWG cloud via hybrid, allowing organizations flexibility to scale to the cloud at their own pace.\n\n\"We’re proud of both our deep focus on data security and unique ability to innovate in a way that pushes the boundaries of Security Service Edge,\" said Gee Rittenhouse, CEO, Skyhigh Security. \"We have the most robust classification engine on the market, unified platform that can extend policies across the web and cloud in less than 60 seconds, along with the most APIs in the industry—across more than 40,000 cloud services.

As part of this groundbreaking move, Mythical Games will also introduce and launch a Mythos \"Superchain\" for the benefit of the Mythos ecosystem - a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) established to reduce barriers to entry for game developers - on Polkadot. This will allow new gaming partners and projects to leverage Polkadot’s unique technology and community to create the largest and most connected gaming ecosystem in Web3.\n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230426005431/en/\n\nThe announcement coincides with the global release of NFL Rivals, the National Football League (NFL) and NFL Players Association’s (NFLPA) first officially licensed blockchain video game, developed in partnership with Mythical Games.\n\nJohn Linden, Founder and CEO of Mythical Games, said: \"The decision to leave the Ethereum ecosystem is a combination of issues surrounding relatively slow transaction speeds, even with L2 roll-ups, that would ultimately hinder Mythical’s scaling plans with our new games this year. Further, it is critical to be building on a security and governance infrastructure that gets stronger over time with more participation and is fully interoperable with other Mythos ecosystem gaming partners. After discussions with numerous blockchain protocols, it was an easy decision: Polkadot’s commitment to innovation, security, and governance provides the most value for our community. We believe this new technology will not only support our growth efforts, but also enable other Mythos partners to utilize this technology for their own high-scale projects.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nFollowing the transition to Polkadot, the Mythical Chain will enable Mythos gaming partners to build their own chains without sacrificing interoperability or connectivity. This will result in a new \"Superchain\", a scalable platform that will be accessible to all Mythos partners and compliant with Web2 gaming platforms, including the Epic Games Store, without sacrificing interoperability or connectivity. This accessibility is a core principle for Mythical as it continues to bridge the gap between blockchain and traditional gaming.\n\nBjörn Wagner, CEO of Parity Technologies, a leading contributor to the Polkadot network, said: \"We are thrilled Mythical Games was drawn to the unique strengths of Polkadot, which allows projects to create their own ecosystems within Polkadot, including their own governance and treasury. Together with Mythical, we look forward to onboarding additional AAA gaming companies and gamers to the Mythos ecosystem, bringing Polkadot one step closer to becoming the global leader in next-generation gaming. As we’ve gotten to know John and the Mythical team, it’s become apparent that we hold the same beliefs around decentralization and technical innovation, and I’m confident that together we will push Web3 capabilities years ahead of where we are today.\"\n\nThe Polkadot ecosystem will also benefit from Mythical’s advanced features, streaming technologies, and Web3 gaming expertise. Boasting over 3 million digital asset transactions per month, 200,000 active wallets utilizing over 1 native million MYTH tokens a day in gaming transactions, and a rapidly growing portfolio of games, Mythical is a leading innovator in Web3 gaming and metaverse. The engagement brings a significant potential for growth and interoperability, driving adoption of Mythical and Polystream - Mythical’s interactive streaming platform - across Polkadot’s burgeoning ecosystem.\n\nFounded in 2018, Mythical features immersive games including NFL Rivals (iOS, Google Play) - its newest game of all and the first Web3 game from the National Football League (NFL) and NFL Players Association (NFLPA) - its flagship Blankos Block Party on Epic Game Store, and the soon-to-be-released Nitro Nation: World Tour (iOS, Google Play). The Mythical Chain is currently in the top four blockchains in terms of monthly digital asset sales and handles more gaming transactions a day than any other blockchain - including Ethereum - with more than 3.2 million on-chain gaming transactions in the last 30 days.\n\nIn addition to the migration to Polkadot, Mythical will provide its patent-pending digital asset reservation system to its users. The system can escrow any item on-chain, ensuring that even if a purchase starts on a traditional gaming ecosystem, it will be delivered to players buying with fiat while still recording the transaction or sale on-chain. Currently compliant with major gaming ecosystems like the Epic Games Store, Apple iOs, and Google Play, additional compatibility is forthcoming and will subsequently expand both the Mythical and Polkadot communities even further.\n\nMark Cachia, Founder and CIO of Scytale Digital, said: \"In choosing Polkadot, Mythical Games now has a solid foundation of innovative and top performing tech to lean on and will be able to focus on what it’s great at - games. We are confident that Polkadot will deliver on its promise to be the most advanced and versatile blockchain platform which is why Scytale is proud to be a valued partner in this deal.\"\n\nFor more information on Polkadot, visit polkadot.network.\n\nAbout Mythical Games\n\nAcknowledged by Fast Company’s World Changing Ideas 2021 and Forbes’ Disruptive Technology Companies To Watch in 2019, Mythical is a next-generation games technology company creating a web3 gaming ecosystem by leveraging blockchain technology and playable NFTs for tools that enable players, creators, artists, brands and game developers to become stakeholders and owners in new \"play and own\" game economies. Led by gaming industry veterans, the team specializes in building games around player-owned economies and has helped develop major franchises including Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Guitar Hero, DJ Hero, Marvel Strike Force, and Skylanders.\n\nMythical Platform can be added to pre-existing game economies or built into the design of a new game from the ground up, and enables management of digital asset trades, payments, users, and inventory management, making it possible for buyers and sellers of digital assets to transact confidently in an environment founded on transparency, security, trust and value. Mythical Marketplace provides seamless integration to game inventory and offers fraud protection, fee optimization, and soon asset bundling and buyer and seller pricing recommendations.

Companies are gradually shifting away from on-premises solutions and towards SaaS-based solutions that provide mobile accessibility and other intuitive services. The model’s affordability addresses specific digital asset requirements by targeting businesses of all sizes.\n\nNew York, April 26, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report \"Digital Asset Management Market by Component, Business Function, Deployment Type, Organization Size, Vertical and Region - Global Forecast to 2028\" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p05001212/?utm_source=GNW\n\nFurthermore, these solutions typically provide low-cost options and rapid service deployment.\n\n\n\nCloud segment to have significant growth during the forecast period\n\nCloud Digital Asset Management (DAM) democratizes enterprise-wide digital media management and delivery.Cloud DAM also promises to lower operational costs and boost productivity while providing a single source of truth to protect brand identity.\n\n\n\nFront-end experiences are also influenced by cloud DAM. Bynder announced an integration with Hootsuite Inc., a popular cloud-based social media management platform. Hootsuite dashboards are linked to digital assets sourced from Bynder, allowing social media marketers to easily access creative content without having to download, resize, and re-upload individual files. Furthermore, the rapid increase in data generation is driving up storage demand. AI and machine learning capabilities allow data to be collected, processed, and analyzed more quickly, and business data and applications are migrated to multiple public-private clouds. Several companies, including Cognizant Technology Solutions, MediaBeacon, and Bynder, are involved in digital asset management and are assisting the market’s rapid growth, as most end-users prefer cloud-based solutions.\n\n\n\nRetail & eCommerce vertical to grow at a highest CAGR during the forecast period\n\nBringing a product to market and merchandising it online and offline necessitates the collaboration of many people and teams.A large number of digital files are being created, and they must be easily accessible throughout the process.\n\n\n\nA digital asset management solution for ecommerce is ideal for teams looking to centralize assets used across e-commerce and retail channels.\n\n\n\nWithout a DAM solution, e-commerce and retail businesses may struggle to deliver efficient and effective product launches, campaigns, and day-to-day product sales management.Implementing a file management solution can be a quick and simple process that brings all stakeholders in an e-commerce and retail business together.\n\n\n\nFrom product design and management to online sales and in-store merchandising, a digital asset management solution for e-commerce is an important piece of the puzzle.DAM solutions allow to store digital files together and organize them based on the needs of the team.\n\n\n\nBy storing them in the cloud, they can be accessed securely from the file management solution from anywhere in the world.Retail has become as much about the experience as it is about the product for those who sell offline.\n\n\n\nWith more assets required to support the buying experience, a centralized cloud-based digital asset management solution can help the team get to market faster and stay on brand across channels.\n\n\n\nDigital Asset Management market in North America to grow at the highest market size during the forecast period\n\nMany start-ups and global corporations are based in North America.Global business groups from various industries have their global headquarters, as well as significant workforce and manufacturing units, in the United States.\n\n\n\nSome multinational corporations, such as Alphabet Inc, AT&T, Dell Technologies Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, Apple Inc, and others, have a sizable workforce in the United States.As a result, there is a high demand for effective human resource development software.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the region’s growing economic prosperity welcomes new companies and start-ups for long-term establishments, opening up a plethora of opportunities for HR management software.According to the Bureau of Labour Statistics, the quarterly number of businesses starts in the United States was around 356,000 in the third quarter of 2021.\n\n\n\nA dense market’s long-term trade benefits attract HR management software companies to offer their services on a larger scale, propelling growth even further. Several brand partnerships occur in the region to advance the operational capabilities of various operating units of organizations, thereby developing the overall ecosystem in the area. UKG Inc, for example, acquired SpotCues and its mobile communications platform, Groupe.io, in February 2022.

		"content": "TikTok is experimenting with a new tool that allows users to create generative AI avatars, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. The new tool was first spotted by social media consultant Matt Navarra. The tool isn’t broadly available, and is currently being tested in a few select markets, the company said. With this test product, TikTok is essentially building a Lensa-like app directly within its platform.\n\nOnce users get access to the tool, it will ask them to select between three to 10 photos to create avatars, according to screenshots posted by Navarra. You can only use the tool once a day, and each time you use it, it will generate up to 30 avatars.\n\nTikTok has a NEW generative AI avatar creator! 🤖🎨📷 View thread to see what it can do 👇 pic.twitter.com/TDBbwok6bt — Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) April 25, 2023\n\nAfter you upload your images, you can pick up to five different styles for the tool to use when generating your avatars. Navarra notes that it takes a couple of minutes for the app to generate the AI avatars. You can then choose to download one or several of the AI avatars. You have the option to share an avatar to your TikTok story or upload it as your profile avatar.\n\n“We’re always thinking about new ways to add value to the community and enrich the TikTok experience, as we continue to build a safe place that entertains, inspires creativity, and drives culture,” a spokesperson for TikTok told TechCrunch in an email. “In a few select regions, we’re experimenting with a new way to create and share profile pictures with the TikTok community.”\n\nAlthough the styles with TikTok’s tool are more limited than what you can get on Lensa, a paid app, the results are impressive.\n\nAnd give you the option to share an avatar to your TikTok story and / upload it as your profile avatar pic.twitter.com/XPzhNxjqsK — Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) April 25, 2023\n\nPhotos that violate TikTok’s Community Guidelines cannot be used to create avatars, and photos that are uploaded will be moderated by the app’s content moderation systems. TikTok will delete all of the photos that users upload after a short period of time.\n\nTikTok says that the features it experiments with don’t always end up in the final product, and for features that do, they can look and feel different by the time they launch broadly.\n\nLast winter, Lensa climbed to the top of the U.S. App Store charts as users around the world posted artistic renditions of themselves that they generated on the app. In response to the app’s success, consumer demand for AI edits had pushed numerous other “AI” apps into the U.S. App Store’s Top Charts. At the time, the top three spots on the U.S. App Store were all held by AI photo editors.\n\nGiven the success around generative AI avatar tools, it’s no surprise that TikTok is looking to incorporate its own version within its platform. Of course, the success around AI photo apps is paired with controversy, as artists have raised red flags about apps like Lensa AI sampling their work. TikTok is likely looking to avoid such controversy by experimenting with a limited tool.\n\nIt’s worth noting that this isn’t the first time that TikTok has built and incorporated its own limited version of a popular AI app. Back in August 2022, the company introduced an in-app text-to-image AI generator that lets users type in a prompt and receive an image that can be used as the background in their videos. The filter was released in response to the popularity of OpenAI’s DALL-E 2 text-to-image AI generator."

MTS has committed to transitioning its bus fleet from compressed natural gas to 100% zero tailpipe emission bus (ZEB) by 2040.\n\nThe program will begin at the South Bay facility, south of downtown San Diego, where bp pulse will deploy Omega charge management on 36 chargers, with plans to scale operations to three additional locations over the next five years, bringing the expected charger count to 150 across all four locations. Omega will manage DC fast chargers from multiple charger manufacturers at the different locations.\n\n\"Transitioning to a zero emission bus fleet by 2040 is one of the top priorities for MTS,\" said Sharon Cooney, MTS Chief Executive Officer. \"It is a complex process to get this done, with many moving parts. Selecting a vendor for the charge management software was a big step in this process. We are excited to work with bp pulse to provide critical technology to charge our vehicles.\"\n\nThe Omega charge management system will integrate with MTS bus telematics and control systems—responding in real time to changing routes with the capability to prioritize charging-based needs. Through the Omega dashboard, MTS will be able to monitor state of charge for the electric buses to monitor for efficiency, range, battery life, and more, ensuring vehicles are operating reliably and efficiently. Omega will also assist with utility tariffs management and utility costs, ensuring MTS is in compliance with utilities, while also providing cost savings, energy efficiency, and allow for budgeting.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"This announcement represents a noteworthy step towards zero tailpipe emission public transportation by incorporating advanced technology that can accelerate scale,\" said Vic Shao, President of bp pulse fleet. \"Omega will do more than manage MTS's fleet of EVs. Because Omega is hardware and software agnostic, MTS will be able to expand their fleets and charging stations with different brands or classes of vehicles with the confidence that they can seamlessly integrate with whatever products best suit their needs.\"\n\nMTS has been at the forefront of adopting sustainable public transportation practices, with a substantial investment in its electric bus fleet. The new addition of Omega charge management software further demonstrates MTS's commitment to providing clean, reliable, and efficient public transportation to Southern California.\n\nAbout bp\n\nbp's purpose is to reimagine energy for people and our planet.

		"content": "Swiping and tapping on flat screens is something we’ve learned to deal with in smartphones, tablets and other touchscreen gizmos, but it doesn’t come close to the ease of typing on a hardware keyboard or playing a game with a physical controller. To that end, researchers Craig Shultz and Chris Harrison with the Future Interfaces Group (FIG) at Carnegie Mellon University have created a display that can protrude screen areas in different configurations. It’s a concept we’ve seen before, but this version is thinner, lighter and more versatile.\n\nFIG’s “Flat Panel Haptics” tech can be stacked under an OLED panel to create the protrusions: imagine screen sections that can be inflated and deflated with fluid on demand. This could add a new tactile dimension for things like pop-up media controls, keyboards and virtual gamepads you can find without fumbling around on the screen. As Gizmodo notes, haptic feedback like Apple’s Taptic Engine produces natural-feeling vibrations but doesn’t help you find onscreen elements by touch alone. For activities like typing and playing games that require rapid-fire response time, a screen with pop-up elements could make things much less frustrating.\n\nThe Embedded Electroosmotic Pumps (EEOPs) are arrays of fluid pumps on a thin actuation layer built into a touchscreen device, like a smartphone or car display. When an onscreen element requires a pop-up button, fluid fills a section of the EEOP layer, and the OLED panel on top bends to take that shape. The result is a “button” that sticks out from the flat surface by as much as 1.5 mm, enough to feel the difference. When the software dismisses it, it recedes back into the flat display. The research team says filling each area takes about one second, and they feel solid to touch.\n\nFuture Interfaces Group at Carnegie Mellon\n\nIf the concept sounds familiar (and you’ve been following consumer tech long enough), this tech may remind you of Tactus’ rising touchscreen keyboard, which ultimately shipped as a bulky iPad mini case. FIG’s prototype can take on more dynamic shapes and sizes, and the research team says their version’s thinness sets it apart from similar attempts. “The main advantage of this approach is that the entire mechanical system exists in a compact and thin form factor,” FIG said in its narration for a demo video. “Our device stack-ups are under 5mm in thickness while still offering 5mm of displacement. Additionally, they are self-contained, powered only by a pair of electrical cables and control electronics. They’re also lightweight (under 40 grams for this device), and they are capable of enough force to withstand user interaction.”\n\nSubscribe to the Engadget Deals Newsletter Great deals on consumer electronics delivered straight to your inbox, curated by Engadget’s editorial team. See latest Subscribe Please enter a valid email address Please select a newsletter By subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms and Privacy Policy.\n\nThe researchers see this as a tactile equivalent to the way pixels work on displays. “Much like LCD pixels, which modulate light from a common backlight, EEOPs draw from a common fluid reservoir and selectively modulate hydraulic pressure in and out of haptic cells.”\n\nThe pop-up buttons in their current form have a limited scope of shapes and sizes, reducing their versatility. But if they can eventually apply the same principle to a layer with more / smaller pop-up buttons (essentially “higher resolution” if we’re extending the “pixels” metaphor), it could open new doors for user interaction, including easier onscreen typing, gaming, in-car controls and even accessibility features like onscreen braille."

Set several years after the events of Star Wars: Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, we found Cal living under the radar and working as a scrapper before embarking on a journey to rediscover his Jedi roots.\n\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor begins with Cal in full Jedi Knight mode (minus the robes — he prefers ponchos — though he does have a nice, full ginger beard to show his maturity), working with the notoriously violent rebel leader Saw Gerrera to peck at the empire while continuing to master powers.\n\nIt’s an authentically Star Wars experience through and through. It begins on Imperial-controlled Coruscant, the centre of galactic civilization, before moving on to other planets outside direct Imperial control. We’re reintroduced to beloved characters from the first game — like the wisecracking four-armed hustler-cum-pilot Greez — and meet several new ones, including an antique droid named Zee who’s been asleep for hundreds of years. Expect both generous doses of humour and some surprisingly emotional moments as Cal and his ragtag crew search for a safe haven free of Imperials while taking on a major new bad guy who shall remain nameless here to preserve your sense of shock and wonder.\n\nJust as importantly, Survivor dives deep into and continues to build Star Wars lore just as effectively as one of the franchise’s films. In particular, it drops loads of tantalizing tidbits about the High Republic, the ancient era during which the Republic and the Jedi Order flourished and explored the galaxy, with Cal investigating aging shrines (clearly inspired by the puzzle-y shrines in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild) from that legendary period of Star Wars history. It’s an era many lovers of Star Wars lore — myself included — have long wished to see more of in film and games (for whatever reason the franchise’s creative minds seem obsessed with focusing on the 75 or so years between Episodes I and IX).\n\nStory continues\n\nBut while I adore what the Star Wars Jedi series is doing in terms of expanding Star Wars lore, I haven’t been the biggest fan of how it plays. Survivor‘s opening hours spent wall-running, ceiling climbing, and hopping between platforms — all carryover mechanics from the original, largely cribbed from other Respawn games, like Titanfall — left me lukewarm. But after spending a few more hours on the wild west-style outer rim planet of Koboh and getting a sense for flow and core play loops Survivor offers, I found myself slowly won over.\n\nLightsaber combat is still loads of fun. Players are able to customize Cal’s melee techniques by switching between stances and types of saber (I’m partial to the Darth Maul-inspired dual blade, though wielding a single blade in classic Luke style is pretty satisfying, too). And, much like a role-playing game, Cal continues to learn powerful new abilities throughout the game, from the ability to throw and direct his saber to a Jedi mind trick that causes enemies to attack each other.\n\nExploration took a little more time to warm up to, but I got there. We can freely explore each planet (to a degree — there are lots of Metroid-ish artificial barriers you’ll need to ignore until you earn whatever ability is needed to get past them), which is fine, except that I didn’t find navigation to be particularly intuitive. I frequently found myself disoriented and unsure where to go, and Cal’s summonable 3D holomap didn’t do much to ease my confusion. More in-game cues or heads-up display elements showing us where to go would have been helpful. I’d have loved one of those little compasses at the top of the screen that shows waypoints and areas of interest. Exploration became a lot more enjoyable once Cal started taming alien animals and using them as mounts and as a means to glide long distances.\n\nThe one thing I found I needed to consciously overlook throughout were the seemingly convoluted solutions to the game’s environmental puzzles. When confronted with a raised bridge gummed up with tar, why not just use a lightsaber to cut it away? Does Cal really need to find a machine that pops out a BB-8-like roller mine, lure it to roll behind him, then use the Force to hurl it at the bridge (and hope that the explosion doesn’t destroy the whole thing)? As Obi-wan might say, it seems an inelegant solution for a civilized Jedi.\n\nWhat is elegant, and in no uncertain terms, is the presentation. Survivor captures the beauty of this far, far away galaxy with stunningly rendered worlds that absolutely scream Star Wars with their exotic flora and fauna, old-meets-new architecture, and beat up tech. Greez’s cantina on Koboh is an absolute visual delight, a place I wish I could visit in the real world.\n\nThe characters, meanwhile, are expertly modelled and animated — especially some of the aliens and robots, such as a bartending droid that’s just fascinating to watch as he slides along the bar, four arms and two heads (one of which is an aquarium of sorts) constantly doing things. It’s one of the prettier current generation games I’ve encountered, and far easier on the eyes than anything coming out of Lucasfilm’s TV animation studios, which seem woefully stuck in aughts-era CGI.\n\nIt took a little longer than I’d have liked to really draw me in, but once Star Wars Jedi: Survivor had its hooks in I went happily along for the ride. If Kathleen Kennedy greenlit a Cal Kestis TV series or film, I’d be over the moon. Maybe just with a little less wall-running."

		"content": "For days, Miley Cyrus fans have been floating an interesting theory online, but the jury is still out on whether or not any of it is true.\n\nAccording to Just Jared, fans have been speculating that Cyrus secretly released music on Spotify and Apple Music under a completely different name: Clara Pierce.\n\nThe reasoning? Pierce’s deep, raspy voice sounds eerily similar to Cyrus’s trademark vocals. Plus, Pierce’s debut album, Down With Me, dropped on March 10 — the very same day that Cyrus released her latest album, Endless Summer Vacation. In addition, there doesn’t seem to be any trace of a singer named “Clara Pierce” online nor any marketing campaigns that were launched around the new album.\n\nTogether, these coincidences have led fans to believe that Pierce is really Cyrus’s alter ego, much like Sasha Fierce was to Beyoncé. And recently, chatter about the album has begun sweeping Twitter and TikTok.\n\nclara pierce is miley cyrus pic.twitter.com/eb7iJ3gODx — leeann 🫶🏻s bea 💌🕰️ (@Iapidus) April 25, 2023\n\nMany fans have wondered if Down With Me was some kind of secret companion album to Endless Summer Vacation or just another elaborate, AI-generated fake.\n\nIs anyone else listening to the secret Miley Cyrus album 👀 because who tf is Clara Pierce?? — name (@henriiluiis92) April 25, 2023\n\nAt the same time, others began to argue that Pierce’s album was actually better than Cyrus’s new music, which led to a heated debate.\n\nclara pierce’s new album is better than miley cyrus’s new album pic.twitter.com/mcEvhPo2Eb — josue (@aesparem) April 25, 2023\n\nSome also joked that Cyrus was putting a Hannah Montana on her fans.\n\nBut once talk about the “secret” album started to go viral this week, Down with Me was suddenly pulled from Spotify — without any explanation. As of April 25, it can no longer be found on the streaming site.\n\nDown with me, by Clara pierce/ allegedly by @MileyCyrus isn’t loading on my Spotify anymore………what happened, is anyone else’s doing this or just me? pic.twitter.com/JmCwMt1bzN — Al Pal (@alliemack96) April 25, 2023\n\nAccording to reports, it does seem to be the consensus that the 12 tracks previously listed under Clara Pierce do, in fact, feature Cyrus’s vocals. That said, neither Cyrus nor her reps have made an official statement about the controversy.\n\nAnd if this is, in fact, Cyrus’s music, it’s unclear who would have uploaded the track — if it was the singer herself, with permission, or if someone with access to her scrapped demos released them without authorization.\n\nAs Seventeen reports, there was a collection of “lost songs” that were meant for the album She Is Miley Cyrus, which was set to be released in 2020 but later scrapped.\n\nCyrus later opened up about what happened in an Instagram post, in which she referenced the house fire that destroyed her home in Malibu in 2018, taking considerable amounts of recording material with it.\n\n“Just when I thought the body of work was finished… it was ALL erased,” the singer shared with her fans. “Including most of the music’s relevance. Because EVERYTHING had changed. Nature did what I now see as a favor and destroyed what I couldn’t let go of for myself. I lost my house in a fire but found myself in its ashes.”\n\nWhatever the real story is, fans are seriously missing the Clara Pierce album and are hoping it returns to Spotify or Apple Music soon. Until then, they’re taking what they can get on YouTube, where copied segments of the songs still exist.\n\nIn The Know by Yahoo is now available on Apple News — follow us here!\n\nSpecial Offer for You Casual summer styles are up to 60% off at Nordstrom Rack Shop Now\n\nMore from In The Know:\n\nWhere does the term 'DINK' come from, and why is it suddenly all over TikTok?\n\n‘American Genocide’ podcast shares how Indigenous youth are helping to inspire a Native boarding school reckoning\n\nBanana Republic just created the 3 best T-shirts of all time during its brand glow-up — and I'm not OK\n\nThis Amazon best-selling hair oil combats frizz and adds shine — plus, it legit smells like a luxurious perfume"

(NYSE American and TASE: LCTX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing allogeneic cell therapies for unmet medical needs, today announced that results from imaging analyses of structural changes and visual data from a Phase 1/2a clinical study of RG6501 (OpRegen), were presented at the 2023 Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Annual Meeting (ARVO 2023). The presentation, \"Exploratory optical coherence tomography (OCT) analysis in patients with geographic atrophy (GA) treated by OpRegen: Results from the Phase 1/2a trial\" was presented by Eyal Banin, M.D., Ph.D., Director, Center for Retinal and Macular Degenerations, Department of Ophthalmology at Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, on behalf of Roche and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group.\n\nRG6501 (OpRegen) is an allogeneic retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell therapy currently in development for the treatment of geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). It is being developed under an exclusive worldwide collaboration between Lineage, Roche and Genentech, and is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2a clinical study in patients with GA secondary to AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05626114).\n\n\"We are extremely pleased to see our observations of improved retinal structure in the initial clinical study of OpRegen are being reinforced by additional external and independent analyses of the images performed by Genentech and Roche. Looking ahead, we are excited to collaborate with Genentech and Roche on the ongoing Phase 2a study of OpRegen, which is currently enrolling patients and open at multiple sites in the US, with more sites expected to come online this year,\" stated Brian Culley, CEO of Lineage.\n\nStory continues\n\nDr. Banin added, \"I have been closely involved with the OpRegen program since its beginning and I continue to be excited about the potential therapeutic benefit for patients afflicted with dry AMD and geographic atrophy, a progressive and debilitating disease that significantly affects the quality of life of many. These data further highlight the potential for a single dose of OpRegen to provide significant clinical outcomes for patients in a disease with a tremendous unmet need.\"\n\n2023 ARVO Presentation Highlights\n\nPreliminary evidence of outer retinal structure and visual function improvements with OpRegen was observed in patients with GA and impaired vision (Cohort 4 [n=12]): Patients in Cohort 4 had an average 7.6 letter gain in visual acuity at 12 months in the study eye; Three patients in Cohort 4 (25%) had a 15 letter or greater gain in visual acuity at 12 months in the study eye.\n\nLong term vision preservation with outer retinal structure improvement observed in the OpRegen treated eye persisted for up to 4 years of follow-up.\n\nThe extent of OpRegen bleb coverage over the area of atrophy may be important to optimize patient outcomes: In patients with extensive OpRegen bleb coverage, maintenance or improvement of outer retina structure was observed in treated eyes compared to worsening in fellow eyes: Five patients in Cohort 4 who had a surgically delivered bleb containing OpRegen that extensively covered their atrophic areas and the foveal center, experienced an average 12.8 letter gain in their study eye. Improvement in outer retinal layers also correlated with the extent of OpRegen bleb coverage: Slower rates of RPE and external limiting membrane (ELM) loss were observed in OpRegen treated eyes compared to fellow untreated eyes; Patients with extensive OpRegen bleb coverage of the atrophic area had maintenance or improvement of RPE and ELM layers compared to patients with limited OpRegen bleb coverage. Resolution of complete RPE and outer retinal atrophy (cRORA) near borders of baseline GA were observed in cases with extensive coverage: Signs of improvement in areas of cRORA included: greater hyperreflectivity at the level of RPE/ Bruch's membrane (BM); less choroidal hypertransmission; reduction of retinal subsidence, and greater continuity of outer retinal layers. OCT imaging with segmentation analysis may be advantageous in assessment of retinal integrity following OpRegen treatment: OCT enables quantitation of changes in RPE and outer retinal structure (such as ELM loss) not possible with FAF imaging following OpRegen subretinal delivery.\n\nOne patient in Cohort 4 maintained improvement in visual acuity at 4 years post-treatment in the study eye (+3 letters read), compared to losing 30 letters in the untreated eye.\n\nOverall, these data suggest that OpRegen RPE cells may provide support to the remaining retinal cells within atrophic areas by counteracting host RPE cell dysfunction and loss.\n\nFurther assessment of the optimal disease stage for intervention and target delivery location of OpRegen in a larger clinical study is needed to confirm these preliminary findings.\n\nA Phase 2a study evaluating the success of OpRegen delivery to target areas of GA is currently enrolling patients (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05626114).\n\nDr. Banin’s presentation is now available on the Events and Presentations section of Lineage’s website.\n\nThe Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc. (ARVO) was founded in 1928 in Washington, DC by a group of 73 ophthalmologists. ARVO is the largest and most respected eye and vision research organization in the world. ARVO members include nearly 11,000 researchers from over 75 countries. ARVO advances research worldwide into understanding the visual system and preventing, treating and curing its disorders. For more information, please visit https://www.arvo.org/ or follow the association on Twitter @ARVOInfo.\n\nAbout OpRegen®\n\nOpRegen is a retinal pigment epithelial cell therapy in development for the treatment of geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration. Following subretinal delivery, OpRegen has the potential to counteract RPE cell loss in areas of GA lesions by supporting retinal structure and function. OpRegen is being developed under a worldwide collaboration between Lineage, Roche and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group.\n\nAbout the Phase 1/2a Study\n\nThe Phase 1/2a study is an open-label, single-arm, multi-center, dose-escalation trial evaluating a single administration of OpRegen delivered subretinally in patients with bilateral GA. Twenty-four patients were enrolled into 4 cohorts. The first 3 cohorts enrolled only legally blind patients with a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/200 or worse. The fourth cohort enrolled 12 patients with impaired vision (BCVA from 20/65 to 20/250 with smaller mean areas of GA). Cohort 4 also included patients treated with a new \"thaw-and-inject\" formulation of OpRegen, which can be shipped directly to sites and used immediately upon thawing, removing the complications and logistics of having to use a dose preparation facility. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of OpRegen as assessed by the incidence and frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the preliminary activity of OpRegen treatment by assessing the changes in ophthalmological parameters measured by various methods of primary clinical relevance.\n\nAbout Geographic Atrophy\n\nGeographic atrophy (GA) is an advanced form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) characterized by severe loss of visual function. GA is a leading cause of adult blindness in the developed world, affecting at least 5 million people globally. There are two forms of advanced AMD: neovascular AMD and GA. GA and neovascular AMD can occur simultaneously in the same eye, and patients treated for neovascular AMD may still go on to develop GA. GA typically affects both eyes.\n\nAbout Lineage Cell Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nLineage Cell Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel cell therapies for unmet medical needs. Lineage’s programs are based on its robust proprietary cell-based therapy platform and associated in-house development and manufacturing capabilities. With this platform Lineage develops and manufactures specialized, terminally differentiated human cells from its pluripotent and progenitor cell starting materials.

AI is the perfect co-pilot for people with dyslexic skills.”\n\nAs part of the campaign, Made By Dyslexia and Sir Richard’s company Virgin, have released a video asking AI to think like famous dyslexic thinkers.\n\nThey argue that the video shows that, while impressive, AI cannot replicate the insight and innovation of people with dyslexia.\n\nLast year, Sir Richard and Made By Dyslexia collaborated with LinkedIn to recognise dyslexic thinking as a valuable skill (Stefan Jeremiah)\n\nInstead, they believe that AI and dyslexic thinking can be combined.\n\nLast year, Sir Richard and Made By Dyslexia collaborated with LinkedIn to recognise dyslexic thinking as a valuable skill.\n\nMade By Dyslexia’s founder Kate Griggs said that “thousands” of people had since signed up to having dyslexic thinking as a skill on their LinkedIn profile.\n\n“We launched dyslexic thinking as a skill on LinkedIn a year ago, thousands of people have signed up,” she said.\n\n“It’s the most amazing way to help the world to understand dyslexia as a skill by having it on on a platform where everybody celebrates their skills.”\n\nSir Richard, who added the skill to his LinkedIn profile, said it was a “brilliant idea”.\n\n“I’ve met so many kids over the years who’ve been dyslexic, and and now when I meet kids, instead of them being down about it, they are proud about it and they see it as a superpower,” he said.\n\n“They have to struggle to get through math, reading, the absolute basics at school.\n\nStory continues\n\n“But once they’re through that they can use their superpower which is their creativity and the fact that they will excel at other things to really flourish in life.”\n\nSir Richard said that while he struggled in school because of his dyslexia, he believed that it had made his career.\n\n“Well I think it’s sort of made my career, really,” he said.\n\n“If I go back to when I was a 15-year-old and I couldn’t do the sort of basic school stuff, because my brain wasn’t wired for conventional learning of things that I wasn’t interested in.\n\n“So I left school to start a magazine – which is quite bizarre for somebody who’s dyslexic – to campaign against the Vietnamese War, to campaign against the way we were taught at schools, to try to put the world right.”\n\nHe said he would not have left school to start his first business if he had not been dyslexic.\n\n“First of all, if I hadn’t been dyslexic, I wouldn’t have left school to do it,” he said.\n\n“Secondly, I was dyslexic, I had to be a very good delegator and surround myself with great people, I had to become a great listener.”\n\nHe said that his dyslexia meant that he was able to “see the bigger picture”.\n\n“I could see the bigger picture, and I was willing to shoot for the skies,” he said.\n\n“From starting a magazine to starting a record company, then getting the brand going on a global basis, and the airline industry was pretty awful in those days – to start an airline – just thinking differently, perhaps, than people who weren’t dyslexic.”\n\nMade By Dyslexia’s free training will be available on LinkedIn learning later this year."

Register in advance: https://na.eventscloud.com/website/54369/.\n\nImportant Safety Information about LOTEMAX® SM (loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic gel) 0.38%\n\nINDICATION\n\nLOTEMAX® SM (loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic gel) 0.38% is a corticosteroid indicated for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nLOTEMAX ® SM, as with other ophthalmic corticosteroids, is contraindicated in most viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva including epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, and varicella, and also in mycobacterial infection of the eye and fungal diseases of ocular structures.\n\nProlonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision. Steroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma. If LOTEMAX ® SM is used for 10 days or longer, IOP should be monitored.\n\nUse of corticosteroids may result in posterior subcapsular cataract formation.\n\nThe use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation. In those with diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids. The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining.\n\nProlonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infections.\n\nEmployment of a corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires great caution. Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex).\n\nFungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local steroid application. Fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use. Fungal cultures should be taken when appropriate.\n\nContact lenses should not be worn when the eyes are inflamed.\n\nThere were no treatment-emergent adverse drug reactions that occurred in more than 1% of subjects in the three times daily group compared to vehicle.\n\nYou are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

		"content": "By Richa Naidu and Dominique Vidalon\n\nLONDON/PARIS (Reuters) -The world's top consumer goods companies, making everything from instant noodles to soap and ice cream, are paying less for their raw materials and energy, but it may take time before shoppers see significantly lower price tags for household goods.\n\nRising expenses for everything from sunflower oil to milk and grain have hit the packaged goods industry hard over the past two years, prompting companies to hike prices and helping fuel a cost-of-living crisis in many parts of the world.\n\nCost inflation rose during the COVID-19 pandemic and was exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which sent energy prices to record highs last year. Energy costs have since dropped, however, while global prices for some commodities are rising more slowly.\n\nCompanies like Nestle, Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser and Danone continued to raise prices sharply in the first quarter even though input costs are easing.\n\nCost of goods inflation will be \"significantly\" lower this year - Reckitt expects 5% to 9% versus 18% last year, the company's finance chief Jeff Carr said on a call on Wednesday to discuss earnings results. Reckitt shares were down 3% in London.\n\nCarr said that while salary costs have increased, commodities are a \"mixed bag\" and freight costs have declined. First quarter price/mix, a basket of variables the company uses to help determine what prices to charge, rose 12.4% while sales volumes declined 4.5%.\n\n\"Our pricing obviously will be measured in 2023, where we did most of our heavy lifting or pricing in 2022,\" Carr said.\n\nDanone CFO Juergen Esser told a post-earnings call with analysts that while labour costs, liquid milk and sugar prices are up, some other costs are down, so \"we expect inflation to decrease through the year\".\n\nThe maker of Activia yoghurt and Evian water raised first-quarter prices by 10.3% and volume/mix rose 0.2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is unclear when companies may start passing on some of their lower costs to customers. On Tuesday, Associated British Foods said it does not expect many more price increases in the second half of this year, as costs including wheat, vegetable oils, freight and energy start to fall.\n\nProcter & Gamble Co, which makes Luvs diapers, and rival Kimberly-Clark Corp, the manufacturer of Huggies, both saw their sales volumes decline in recent quarters as they pushed through higher prices. Both P&G's and Kimberly-Clark's volumes declined less than the prior quarter. Executives for both companies flagged that pulp, a key ingredient in diapers and toilet paper, has fallen in price.\n\n'NOT DEFLATION'\n\nCompanies including Unilever, which reports earnings on Thursday, acknowledged in February that the industry was past \"peak inflation, but not yet past peak pricing\".\n\nSeveral firms have since made near-record price hikes: beverage giant Coca-Cola Co said average selling prices rose by 11% in the first quarter, while rival PepsiCo Inc said its prices gained 16%.\n\nMany in the industry bought ingredients far in advance, when prices were higher, so it will take time for that to trickle through to the supermarket shelves.\n\n\"We tend to buy nine to 12 months out on commodities,\" Pepsico chief financial officer Hugh Johnston said in an interview with Reuters.\n\n\"Anytime there is an increase in commodity prices, it hits us a little bit later, and when there's a decrease in commodity prices, we would we feel the benefit of that decrease a little bit later as well.\"\n\nThe European Central Bank is concerned that if food inflation keeps accelerating, it will have an outsized impact on consumers' inflation perception, potentially changing spending behaviour, pressuring wage demands and impacting interest rates.\n\nP&G customers, particularly in the United States, continued to show little resistance during the quarter to 10% price increases, helping the Tide detergent maker boost margins even as overall volumes fell 3%.\n\nSimilarly, Nestle increased its prices by 9.8% during the quarter and sales volumes fell 0.5%. CEO Mark Schneider said the European consumer had been more \"resilient\" than expected.\n\nWhen a company can raise prices to a large degree \"it highlights the value of their brands, the value of their pricing power\" said Neil Denman, a fund manager at Reckitt and Unilever investor Sarasin & Partners.\n\n\"I think that's what we're going to see with companies through this year: which companies really have the ability to pass prices through in a difficult consumer environment?\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Ananya Mariam Rajesh and Radhika Anilkumar in Bengaluru and Jessica DiNapoli in New York; Editing by Josephine Mason and Catherine Evans)"

It later released a new version called Halo View and Halo Rise, a contact-less sleep tracker and smart alarm clock.\n\nLike peers Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google, Amazon has invested in health-tracking technology for consumers, at times drawing regulatory scrutiny for sensitive information it aimed to collect – like body fat percentage via its fitness wristband.\n\nAmazon, which in March announced it was laying off 9,000 workers as part of its second retrenchment drive, started informing some of the affected employees on Wednesday. Heads of Amazon Web Services and the People Experience and Technology team emailed affected staff about the cuts, the company said.\n\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber)"

			"(Bloomberg) -- Czech investor Daniel Kretinsky proposed a €1.1 billion ($1.2 billion) equity investment in debt-laden French grocery operator Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA that could end Jean-Charles Naouri’s control over the struggling company.",
			"Kretinsky would invest as much as €750 million in a reserved capital increase, Casino said Monday. Under his proposal, investment firm Fimalac, another Casino shareholder, would be able to put in as much as €150 million and existing shareholders would be tapped for up to €200 million.",
			"Casino said it will examine the plan. Kretinsky’s proposal would include cash repurchases of Casino’s debt, converting it into equity, potentially leading to a change of control and a dilution of existing shareholders. A change of control would require a waiver from the company’s secured creditors, Casino said.",

			"“It remains unclear whether Mr Kretinsky declared war on Mr. Naouri or emerged as his white knight,” wrote Clement Genelot, an analyst at Bryan Garnier. “If approved, these capital increases would greatly reshuffle the ownership structure with Mr. Naouri loosing control to the benefit of Mr Kretinsky.”",
			"Separately, Casino said it’s in talks with Intermarche owner Les Mousquetaires SAS to deepen their current purchasing alliance and extend it to a joint venture that Casino plans with retailer Teract SA.",
			"Sealing one or both deals would mark another escape from potential disaster for Naouri, who built a grocery empire in France and Latin America over more than 30 years with generous helpings of borrowed money. The grocery executive previously saved the debt-burdened structure from collapse in 2019 by obtaining creditor protection for the holding companies through which he controls Casino.",
			"What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:",
			"EP Global Commerce’s proposed €1.1 billion equity raise to rescue Groupe Casino, 57% greater than the undisturbed market value, faces multiple hurdles, with the involvement of Groupement Les Mousquetaires raising antitrust issues. The highly dilutive new equity — existing holders would only subscribe €200 million — would make a dent but not resolve the €4.6 billion French debt. The possibility of Casino’s attractive Parisian assets becoming available may entice other bidders to come forward.",
			"— Charles Allen, BI retail industry analyst",
			"Kretinsky made his fortune building the largest energy group in central Europe with his Slovak investment partner, Patrik Tkac. Kretinsky has been diversifying and taking positions in a number of European and American companies such as UK retailer J Sainsbury Plc and US sneaker chain Foot Locker Inc. He is also a minority shareholder of newspaper Le Monde and TV channel TF1 in France.",
			"Casino aims to extend its alliance with Intermarche to 2028. The troubled retailer might sell a number of stores in France to Intermarche over several years representing a minimum of €1.1 billion in turnover.",
			"Casino shares have lost more than half their value in the past 12 months, giving the owner of Franprix and Monoprix a market value of about €738 million. The company’s bonds trade at deeply distressed levels, implying investors see a default as likely.",
			"Casino is considering asking for a court-appointed conciliator to oversee discussions with bank creditors and bondholders over the Kretinsky and Intermarche plans, since approval from lenders may be needed for the transactions, it said. The retailer will ask bondholders to agree that the appointment of a conciliator doesn’t constitute a default on its debt.",
			"The widened talks with Intermarche could lead to the creation of a retail giant capable of taking on bigger rivals such as Carrefour SA while competing with the German discounters Lidl and Aldi, which have aggressively grown market share in France’s cut-throat retail industry at a time consumers are reining in spending amid rampant inflation. The new player would benefit from Casino and Teract’s access to fresh foods, vegetables and bakeries as well as from Intermarche’s fish and meat offerings.",
			"Les Mousquetaires is willing to become a minority shareholder in the new entity to be created by Casino and Teract, according to the statement. Teract’s shareholders include the giant agricultural cooperative InVivo Group, telecom entrepreneur Xavier Niel and banker Matthieu Pigasse. Les Mousquetaires and InVivo are considering an investment of invest €300 million, with Casino and Teract in ongoing talks with potential investors to pump in a total of €500 million, the companies said.",

The gathering — a barometer for whether bailout deals can be reached — showed that governments and the mulitlateral lender remain deadlocked in many cases.",
			"“We don’t come away from the meetings with more optimism” for low-rated bonds, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. strategists wrote in a note. Discussions were on the “bearish side” around several deals, including Egypt and Tunisia.",
			"Bonds from those countries have lost as much as 9% this month, while debt from Lebanon, Senegal and Kenya posted losses in mid-single digits, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.",
			"Several governments are running out of time to fix their fiscal imbalances and win IMF programs. Egypt is facing an acute shortage of wheat, with a little more than two months of stocks, as a currency crisis rages. Kenya had to delay salaries to public-sector workers, while Argentina’s central bank raised rates by 300 basis points to 81% on Thursday to try and contain rampant inflation.",
			"S&amp;P Global Ratings last week lowered the outlook on Egypt’s debt to negative, saying risks have increased that its allies in the wealthy Gulf Arab states would delay or refuse providing funds. The option-adjusted spread on Egyptian bonds in dollars rose the most in emerging markets in the week, rising 198 basis points to 1,434 basis points over US Treasuries.",
			"“A lot of the countries need the money now,” said Mark Bohlund, a senior credit research analyst with REDD Intelligence. “Otherwise, they’ll have to borrow at very high rates, both locally and externally. If they lock up the current high market rates, it is only going to worsen the problem.”",
			"In a twist, the worst performer, Argentina, received another $5.4 billion from the IMF at the end of last month, and some investors are optimistic upcoming elections will bring in a more market-friendly government.",
			"Still, with near triple-digit inflation and falling international reserves weighing on the serial defaulter, the country’s bonds have slid around 12% this month.",
			"For those willing to take on the risk, there’s enormous upside in betting on the most distressed bonds.",
			"Many of the riskiest countries trade below the value investors could expect to receive in a debt restructuring. The average recovery value on defaulted sovereign bonds over the past four decades is 50%, though there have been recoveries as high as 95%, said Elena Duggar, Moody’s chief credit officer for the Americas.",
			"History shows investors have been rewarded for buying back the debt quickly once there’s any incremental progress on talks with lenders. Bolivia is a case in point. The country’s debt was one of the worst performers in emerging markets earlier in April, but rebounded last week on signs it will get multilateral financing support.",
			"Still, in most cases, the market is left waiting for a catalyst.",
			"In Tunisia, for example, bondholders could expect an average recovery rate of 74 cents on the dollar, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co International analysts indicate. Bonds due in 2026 currently trade around 49 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.",

As a result, the US is establishing stronger ties with other trade partners including Europe, a trend Nixon says will continue.",
			"The world’s two largest economies have been steadily becoming less reliant on one another for much of the past year. That’s been driven primarily by a broad-based slowdown in the global economy, and it’s been particularly acute for containers as the demand boom that took place during the pandemic reversed.",

President Joe Biden is seeking to sign an executive order that will limit investment in key parts of China’s economy by American businesses.",
			"The slowdown in the China-US route means America will import more from elsewhere.

		"content": [
			"(Bloomberg) -- Professional investors see the dollar sliding even further from last year’s two-decade highs, as the market has underpriced the Federal Reserve’s oncoming easing cycle.",
			"Some 87% of 331 survey respondents expect the Fed to cut interest rates to 3% or below — some significantly so — in a loosening that 40% believe will start this year, according to the latest MLIV Pulse survey. That stands in contrast to market pricing that puts the implied policy rate around 3.05% in two years.",
			"Correspondingly, professional investors are negative on the dollar, with a 17 percentage-point gap between bears and bulls. Many explicitly state that they are bearish because the yield path as priced is too high. Interestingly, the second most popular response is that banking sector stresses will largely be confined to the US, which further implies that the Fed will be forced to be more dovish than global peers.",
			"Strange as it may appear at first glance, there’s indeed historical precedent for the Fed cutting sharply without other central banks following suit. During the tech bust in the early 2000s and the year leading up to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, US monetary policy diverged radically from global peers. In the case of the latter, the Fed cut by 325 basis points between August 2007 and April 2008, while the European Central Bank infamously hiked by 25 basis points in July 2008 — and the dollar was very weak during this pre-Lehman period.",
			"But dollar pessimism is not purely a product of US problems. A surprisingly large cohort of investors believe that either yen or yuan appreciation will be the primary cause of dollar decline.",
			"Why surprising? First, new Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has so far done his best to be as boring as possible, offering little hope to those betting on an end to the super-loose policy that has driven yen weakness. That said, Ueda has a convenient window to scrap yield curve control while there is minimal pressure on local rates markets. If he chooses to act, this would likely lead to substantial yen appreciation — there is evidence that even small BOJ policy changes can have an out-sized impact on the currency.",
			"Second, the Citigroup’s Economic Surprise Index for China rose close to the highest since 2006 this month and yet the yuan is up only about 1% against its trade-weighted basket so far in 2023. The yuan should rise, but it’s worrying that the currency has been almost impervious to good news, as it’s hard to imagine what more the nation can do to impress. Aside from ongoing geopolitical risk, it may simply be that investors need time to get used to the idea that the China trade is back.",
			"De-dollarization?",
			"The risk of a more generalized pivot away from the greenback is something that investors are giving serious consideration. A majority of respondents see the dollar making up less than half of global reserves within a decade.",
			"On the other hand, there remain dollar bulls, particularly among the retail community. A clear majority of those greenback lovers believe that the Fed rate path is actually underpriced, confirming that getting the currency direction correct will ultimately boil down to nailing the policy call.",
			"Interestingly, the risk of a debt-ceiling debacle passes almost unmentioned. However, few would dispute that today’s political environment is extremely acrimonious and risks are as high as they have been for many years. The showdown of 2011 is the best template to judge the likely market response to a serious mishap. Back then, yields fell significantly, yet the dollar rallied during this period as risk aversion dominated investors’ thoughts.",

			"LONDON, April 24 (Reuters) - As calm returns to markets roiled by banking havoc in March, it's time to reflect on the policy response.",
			"The International Monetary Fund has warned of a \"perilous combination of vulnerabilities\" in markets. The Bank of International Settlements says for the first time since World War Two that central banks are dealing with surging inflation coinciding with very high debt levels, threatening economic stability.",
			"\"The risks to the financial system are not as pressing as they were in March but that doesn't mean the crisis has passed,\" said Northern Trust chief economist Carl Tannenbaum, who worked in the Fed's risk section during the 2008 global financial crisis.",
			"Here, experts weigh in on what policymakers did well in March with takeaways for the future.",
			"1/ STICK WITH THE PLAN",
			"The Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank continued hiking rates in March as Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) failed and Credit Suisse (CS) was forced to merge with UBS.",
			"Rapid rate rises after years of ultra-low rates have caused pain. But changing course as markets slid could have exacerbated that.",
			"\"If they hadn't have done those rate increases, there was a danger that people would look at that and say, oh, my god, the situation is even worse than we thought it was,\" said Dario Perkins, managing director, global macro at TS Lombard and a former advisor to Britain's Treasury.",
			"A measure of volatility in the Treasury market has eased after hitting its highest level since 2008 in March.",
			"Low and stable inflation is good for markets and the economy, so central banks had to show their seriousness on inflation, Tannenbaum added.",
			"2/ LOUD AND CLEAR",
			"After staying the course comes selling the message.",
			"The Fed met just 12 days after the SVB failure and the ECB's March 16 meeting was two days before Credit Suisse's rescue. U.S. regional bank stocks tanked 36% in March.",
			"Central banks softened rate rises with communication that was mindful of instability risks, showing reassuring \"humility\", said Perkins.",
			"Not all communication has been stellar.",
			"The Swiss National Bank said on March 15 Credit Suisse met capital and liquidity requirements.",
			"\"And then days later Credit Suisse was gone,\" said Gael Combes, head of fundamental research at Swiss fund manager Unigestion.",
			"That reversal highlighted prospects of central bankers being \"caught on the back foot,\" Combes said.",
			"Aggressive tightening may still create another financial crisis, said Dartmouth economics professor and former Bank of England rate setter David Blanchflower.",
			"U.S. banks face borrowers defaulting on car loans and student debt, while UK mortgage borrowers rolling off cheap fixed rate loans onto more expensive deals could spark defaults, Blanchflower added. \"The tentacles,\" of bank failures, he said, \"are much longer than folks think.\"",
			"3/ TAKE THE PAIN",
			"The 2008 crisis prompted global efforts to stop taxpayers funding bailouts of troubled banks.",
			"Credit Suisse's rescue took the pain elsewhere, as Swiss regulators ruled holders of the bank's Additional Tier 1 bonds, a shock absorber against losses, would be wiped out. Shareholders got $3.3 billion.",
			"Former ECB chief economist Peter Praet said the success of CS's rescue was shown by turmoil not spreading to other banks and creditors bearing the cost to a large extent, which was \"very rare\" for a systemic institution.",
			"But lenders are uncertain about holding AT1s, putting the idea of shock absorbing capital buffers at risk.",
			"\"The bank resolution framework created after the great financial crisis,\" said Francesco Papadia, senior fellow at Bruegel and former ECB director general for market operations, \"is proving difficult to implement.\"",
			"4/ UNITED WE STAND",
			"After CS's rescue, the Fed and other big central banks supported market liquidity with dollar swap lines. Keeping the global reserve currency flowing, in an effort not seen since the 2020 COVID-pandemic, likely prevented fears of international institutions dumping U.S Treasuries to secure dollars or foreign central banks becoming unable to deliver dollars, experts said.",
			"\"It comforts the market,\" said Mahmoud Pradhan, global head of macro at Amundi Institute and former deputy director of the IMF's European department. \"Often the amount of the facility extended is not needed, but it's a safety measure,\" he said.",
			"5/ MORAL HAZARD",
			"In the U.S. the Fed, the Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation took the rare decision to give SVB's customers access to all non-insured deposits.",
			"Political backlash followed, with Republicans opposing universal deposit guarantees on the basis such tools encourage moral hazard.",
			"Amundi's Pradhan said the \"case by case\" central bank responses to individual lenders failing in March exposed the lack of a coordinated bank resolution system.",
			"\"We've seen very little resolution of how to wind down a bank,\" he said. \"What we have not resolved is the resolution system itself.\"",

			"(Bloomberg) -- The Chilean government’s plan to demand a controlling stake in all future lithium projects will deter investment and risks stalling the clean energy transition, according to Canadian mining billionaire Robert Friedland.",

			"“Money is a coward — it runs away at the first sign of trouble.”",
			"See also: Chile Shifts to State Model in Hunt for More Lithium Riches",
			"Demand for lithium, a core ingredient in electric vehicle batteries, is set to soar in the coming decades as automakers move away from gasoline and diesel powered models. Chile is the world’s second-biggest producer of the metal, and President Gabriel Boric is seeking a bigger role for the state in the sector, while also trying to build a domestic processing industry and protect the environment.",
			"The policy bears some similarities to what President Joko Widodo is trying to do with nickel in Indonesia.",
			"Santiago’s move will undermine Chile’s reputation as one of the safer places for foreign investors in Latin America and amounts to “nationalization” of the country’s lithium sector, Friedland said. The mining magnate has been involved in developing some of the world’s biggest copper deposits including Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia and Kamoa-Kakula in the Democratic Republic of Congo.",
			"It’s “likely to set the government back a long ways – denying companies like Rio Tinto and Teck and BHP to come in there and invest,” Friedland said. “That will not end well, in my estimation.”",
			"Governments are inefficient miners, and it was “much more efficient” to encourage the private sector to invest, he said, adding that “ill-considered” nationalist policies risked derailing the clean energy transition.",
			"Santiago’s new policy comes as proposed mining royalty hikes in Chile, social unrest in Peru and the threat of tax increases in Panama have delayed copper projects in those countries and spooked investors. Copper, like lithium, is a core ingredient in clean energy applications and Chile and Peru are the world’s No. 1 and No. 2 producers of the metal.",

			"LONDON (Reuters) - After a bumper year for floating offshore wind farm tenders, the nascent industry is poised for explosive growth in the coming decade as countries strive to cut their carbon emissions.",
			"But it's unlikely to be all plain sailing.",
			"Rising costs and supply chain bottlenecks have hit some projects and without investment in infrastructure to launch the vast turbines and tow them to sea, hopes of harnessing the full power of the ocean's winds to hit climate targets could be dashed, industry experts say.",
			"\"If the next decade is to see the adoption of floating offshore wind, and its growth into a leading market, the work that we do in 2023 will dictate just how successful this is,\" said Felipe Cornago, commercial director offshore wind at BayWa, which is developing a wind farm off Scotland.",
			"About 80% of the world's offshore wind power potential lies in waters deeper than 60 metres, according to the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC), meaning floating turbines will be vital for some countries with little space left on land and steep coastal shelves to decarbonise their power sectors.",
			"Winds are stronger and more continuous further out to sea so floating turbines can generate more power than those fixed to the seabed near to shore - and they less visible from the coast, reducing the risk of resistance from local communities.",
			"By the end of 2022, plans for about 48 gigawatts (GW) of floating wind capacity around the world were in place, nearly double the amount in the first quarter last year, according to Fitch Solutions, with European companies driving the expansion.",
			"Since then, new tenders have been launched in Norway and more are planned this year - but so far there are only just over 120 megawatts (MW) in operation worldwide.",
			"Consultancy DNV forecasts that about 300 GW will be installed by 2050, representing 15% of all offshore wind capacity, but wind turbine makers are already struggling to meet rising demand due to rising inflation and raw material costs.",
			"BOTTLENECKS AND COSTS",
			"The largest project to date, the 88 MW Hywind Tampen project being developed by oil and gas company Equinor off Norway, was meant to be fully commissioned in 2022 but delays due to some steel parts not being of sufficient quality for four of the towers has pushed the start to later this year.",
			"Last year, oil company Shell and state-owned Chinese energy company CGN dropped a plan for a floating wind project off France's Brittany coast, citing inflation and supply chain problems among other reasons.",
			"GWEC said supply bottlenecks for turbines and components could continue or even be compounded by incentives in the United States for low-carbon energy deployment, as well as increased demand in China, Europe and emerging markets.",
			"As most commercial-scale floating wind farms are only expected to be up and running from 2030, there could be time for such problems to be resolved, said Francesco Cacciabue, partner and CFO at renewable energy investor Glennmont Partners.",
			"At the moment, technology costs for floating wind are far higher than for fixed turbines but companies hope to reduce those costs sharply as larger projects come on stream.",
			"According to DNV, the average levelized cost of energy (LCOE) - which compares the total lifetime cost of building and running a power plant to its lifetime output - for floating wind was about 250 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) in 2020, compared with around 50 euros/MWh for fixed turbines.",
			"But by 2035, the LCOE for floating wind is expected to fall to about 60 euros/MWh.",
			"\"For floating, the expectation is that it will sell power at a higher price than fixed-foundation offshore wind for several years while it industrialises and gets to a point where it can compete on a like-for-like basis,\" said Jonathan Cole, chief executive of Corio Generation, part of Macquarie's Green Investment Group. (Graphic: Global floating wind project pipeline, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/akveqeylyvr/Pasted%20image%201679992871412.png)",
			"OFFSHORE PLANS",
			"Norway's Equinor kick-started the floating wind industry after two of its oil and gas engineers saw a marker buoy they thought could be a structure to hold a floating turbine.",
			"The company installed a pilot floating turbine in 2009 and has seen costs fall by 70% from the demonstration project to its 30 MW Hywind Scotland project. It expects a further 40% cost reduction for Hywind Tampen.",
			"\"It's about having larger turbines which are more efficient offshore,\" said Steinar Berge, head of floating wind at Equinor.",
			"\"The journey going forward is more reliant upon putting full-scale projects into action because then you will see much more innovation and investments in the supply chain which will drive costs further down,\" he said.",
			"Still, higher costs in the medium term haven't dulled investor appetite for tenders. For some countries, floating wind might be the best option due to their seabed conditions, such as Japan, South Korea and the west coast of the United States.",
			"\"These are huge areas with the energy demands to match their huge populations, and they have a mandate to decarbonise as quickly as possible,\" said Cacciabue at Glennmont Partners.",
			"The United States wants to develop 15 GW of floating offshore wind capacity by 2035 and its Wind Shot research and development programme hopes to cut the cost to $45/MWh by 2035.",
			"Japan wants to install up to 10 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030, and up to 45 GW by 2040, including floating. It plans to set a specific target for floating wind this year. South Korea, meanwhile, is aiming for 9 GW of floating wind by 2030.",
			"Several countries in Europe have also set targets such as Spain which is seeking up to 3 GW of floating capacity by 2030.",
			"PORTS AND SHIPS",
			"Floating offshore wind farms are made up of huge turbines installed on floating platforms anchored to the seabed with flexible anchors, chains or steel cables.",
			"But at the moment, there are at least 50 designs under development, so narrowing down the concepts is important for standardisation and enabling mass production, experts say.",
			"They believe that can be achieved, as many oil companies have significant expertise operating in deep waters such as Shell, Equinor, BP and Aker Solutions - and some are teaming up with renewable developers to bid in floating wind tenders.",
			"For now, Equinor's Berge said one of the biggest challenges was having enough large ports to assemble the turbines and move them out to sea. Many of his peers agree.",
			"According to a DNV survey of 244 experts, the biggest supply chain risk they identified was having enough suitable ports, followed by the availability of installation vessels.",
			"Ports where towers measuring more than 150 m to the centre of the rotor and their giant floating bases can be manufactured and assembled are ideal - and they will also need enough access channels, berths, land areas and storage space for handling large, heavy structures, experts say.",
			"But in many countries, such ports are sorely lacking.",
			"Britain aims to have 5 GW of floating wind installed by 2030 but a report by the UK Floating Wind Offshore Wind Taskforce, said 34 GW could be installed by 2040 if ports were upgraded.",
			"It said up to 11 ports will need to be transformed into hubs to enable the roll-out of floating offshore wind at scale - along with investment of at least 4 billion pounds ($5 billion).",
			"Britain's Crown Estate will launch a tender for 4 GW of floating wind in the Celtic Sea off Wales this year but said the area had the potential to produce more than 20 GW.",
			"While Britain wants to lead the world on floating wind, some experts say South Korea could be the real winner given its existing ports and large-scale engineering capacity.",
			"\"South Korea will be commercial the quickest,\" said Cole at Corio Generation, which has 1.5 GW of floating wind under development there. \"People want to buy low-carbon products so how South Korea produces its electricity and how it will decarbonise is a really important thing for the entire economy.\"",
			"Another issue is the lack of vessels needed to tow structures to their offshore sites, install them and connect the turbines to the onshore power grid.",
			"\"Even the largest vessels from the oil and gas industry have limited capacity for efficient installation of the latest floating wind farms,\" said DNV.",

			"By Nina Chestney and Susanna Twidale",
			"LONDON, April 24 (Reuters) - After a bumper year for floating offshore wind farm tenders, the nascent industry is poised for explosive growth in the coming decade as countries strive to cut their carbon emissions.",
			"But it's unlikely to be all plain sailing.",
			"Rising costs and supply chain bottlenecks have hit some projects and without investment in infrastructure to launch the vast turbines and tow them to sea, hopes of harnessing the full power of the ocean's winds to hit climate targets could be dashed, industry experts say.",
			"\"If the next decade is to see the adoption of floating offshore wind, and its growth into a leading market, the work that we do in 2023 will dictate just how successful this is,\" said Felipe Cornago, commercial director offshore wind at BayWa , which is developing a wind farm off Scotland.",
			"About 80% of the world's offshore wind power potential lies in waters deeper than 60 metres, according to the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC), meaning floating turbines will be vital for some countries with little space left on land and steep coastal shelves to decarbonise their power sectors.",
			"Winds are stronger and more continuous further out to sea so floating turbines can generate more power than those fixed to the seabed near to shore - and they less visible from the coast, reducing the risk of resistance from local communities.",
			"By the end of 2022, plans for about 48 gigawatts (GW) of floating wind capacity around the world were in place, nearly double the amount in the first quarter last year, according to Fitch Solutions, with European companies driving the expansion.",
			"Since then, new tenders have been launched in Norway and more are planned this year - but so far there are only just over 120 megawatts (MW) in operation worldwide.",
			"Consultancy DNV forecasts that about 300 GW will be installed by 2050, representing 15% of all offshore wind capacity, but wind turbine makers are already struggling to meet rising demand due to rising inflation and raw material costs.",
			"BOTTLENECKS AND COSTS",
			"The largest project to date, the 88 MW Hywind Tampen project being developed by oil and gas company Equinor off Norway, was meant to be fully commissioned in 2022 but delays due to some steel parts not being of sufficient quality for four of the towers has pushed the start to later this year.",
			"Last year, oil company Shell and state-owned Chinese energy company CGN dropped a plan for a floating wind project off France's Brittany coast, citing inflation and supply chain problems among other reasons.",
			"GWEC said supply bottlenecks for turbines and components could continue or even be compounded by incentives in the United States for low-carbon energy deployment, as well as increased demand in China, Europe and emerging markets.",
			"As most commercial-scale floating wind farms are only expected to be up and running from 2030, there could be time for such problems to be resolved, said Francesco Cacciabue, partner and CFO at renewable energy investor Glennmont Partners.",
			"At the moment, technology costs for floating wind are far higher than for fixed turbines but companies hope to reduce those costs sharply as larger projects come on stream.",
			"According to DNV, the average levelized cost of energy (LCOE) - which compares the total lifetime cost of building and running a power plant to its lifetime output - for floating wind was about 250 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) in 2020, compared with around 50 euros/MWh for fixed turbines.",
			"But by 2035, the LCOE for floating wind is expected to fall to about 60 euros/MWh.",
			"\"For floating, the expectation is that it will sell power at a higher price than fixed-foundation offshore wind for several years while it industrialises and gets to a point where it can compete on a like-for-like basis,\" said Jonathan Cole, chief executive of Corio Generation, part of Macquarie's Green Investment Group.",
			"OFFSHORE PLANS",
			"Norway's Equinor kick-started the floating wind industry after two of its oil and gas engineers saw a marker buoy they thought could be a structure to hold a floating turbine.",
			"The company installed a pilot floating turbine in 2009 and has seen costs fall by 70% from the demonstration project to its 30 MW Hywind Scotland project. It expects a further 40% cost reduction for Hywind Tampen.",
			"\"It's about having larger turbines which are more efficient offshore,\" said Steinar Berge, head of floating wind at Equinor.",
			"\"The journey going forward is more reliant upon putting full-scale projects into action because then you will see much more innovation and investments in the supply chain which will drive costs further down,\" he said.",
			"Still, higher costs in the medium term haven't dulled investor appetite for tenders. For some countries, floating wind might be the best option due to their seabed conditions, such as Japan, South Korea and the west coast of the United States.",
			"\"These are huge areas with the energy demands to match their huge populations, and they have a mandate to decarbonise as quickly as possible,\" said Cacciabue at Glennmont Partners.",
			"The United States wants to develop 15 GW of floating offshore wind capacity by 2035 and its Wind Shot research and development programme hopes to cut the cost to $45/MWh by 2035.",
			"Japan wants to install up to 10 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030, and up to 45 GW by 2040, including floating. It plans to set a specific target for floating wind this year. South Korea, meanwhile, is aiming for 9 GW of floating wind by 2030.",
			"Several countries in Europe have also set targets such as Spain which is seeking up to 3 GW of floating capacity by 2030.",
			"PORTS AND SHIPS",
			"Floating offshore wind farms are made up of huge turbines installed on floating platforms anchored to the seabed with flexible anchors, chains or steel cables.",
			"But at the moment, there are at least 50 designs under development, so narrowing down the concepts is important for standardisation and enabling mass production, experts say.",
			"They believe that can be achieved, as many oil companies have significant expertise operating in deep waters such as Shell, Equinor, BP and Aker Solutions - and some are teaming up with renewable developers to bid in floating wind tenders.",
			"For now, Equinor's Berge said one of the biggest challenges was having enough large ports to assemble the turbines and move them out to sea. Many of his peers agree.",
			"According to a DNV survey of 244 experts, the biggest supply chain risk they identified was having enough suitable ports, followed by the availability of installation vessels.",
			"Ports where towers measuring more than 150 m to the centre of the rotor and their giant floating bases can be manufactured and assembled are ideal - and they will also need enough access channels, berths, land areas and storage space for handling large, heavy structures, experts say.",
			"But in many countries, such ports are sorely lacking.",
			"Britain aims to have 5 GW of floating wind installed by 2030 but a report by the UK Floating Wind Offshore Wind Taskforce, said 34 GW could be installed by 2040 if ports were upgraded.",
			"It said up to 11 ports will need to be transformed into hubs to enable the roll-out of floating offshore wind at scale - along with investment of at least 4 billion pounds ($5 billion).",
			"Britain's Crown Estate will launch a tender for 4 GW of floating wind in the Celtic Sea off Wales this year but said the area had the potential to produce more than 20 GW.",
			"While Britain wants to lead the world on floating wind, some experts say South Korea could be the real winner given its existing ports and large-scale engineering capacity.",
			"\"South Korea will be commercial the quickest,\" said Cole at Corio Generation, which has 1.5 GW of floating wind under development there. \"People want to buy low-carbon products so how South Korea produces its electricity and how it will decarbonise is a really important thing for the entire economy.\"",
			"Another issue is the lack of vessels needed to tow structures to their offshore sites, install them and connect the turbines to the onshore power grid.",
			"\"Even the largest vessels from the oil and gas industry have limited capacity for efficient installation of the latest floating wind farms,\" said DNV. ($1 = 0.8036 pounds)",

			"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tesla has begun producing in Shanghai a version of the Model Y to be sold in Canada this year, the first time it will ship cars to North America from China, according to a person with direct knowledge of the plan and a production memo seen by Reuters.",
			"The move would connect Tesla's biggest and most cost-efficient factory in the world to North America, its largest market. The Model Y is the electric vehicle (EV) maker's best-selling model globally.",
			"Over the weekend, Tesla posted on its website that it would offer a new, cheaper version of its Model Y in Canada, a rear-wheel drive variant of the SUV-styled crossover priced C$10,000 ($7,377.90) lower than the long-range version of the vehicle available in that market.",
			"Tesla's website showed that customers in Canada could take delivery of the new version of the Model Y between May and July.",
			"The Canadian government's website was updated on Friday to show that the new version of the Model Y and the more expensive long-range variant both qualify for incentives of C$5,000 on purchase or a four-year lease.",
			"Tesla Shanghai began production of the Canada-bound version of Model Y earlier this month, the person with knowledge of the development said. The production memo reviewed by Reuters showed that vehicles had been designed and tested for export to North America, with a target of producing nearly 9,000 this quarter.",
			"Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
			"Reuters reported in November that Tesla had considered plans for exporting made-in-China vehicles to North America. After the Reuters report was published, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, in a Twitter post, had said \"False,\" without elaborating.",
			"Musk told analysts last week that Tesla's Shanghai plant had the \"lowest cost structure\" of any of its factories.",
			"SUBSIDIES",
			"Canada's transport agency's EV incentive program mandates that a base model for an SUV has to be under C$60,000 to qualify for the subsidy of up to C$5,000. Higher cost variants are then also eligible at a price of up to C$70,000.",
			"The introduction of the cheaper Model Y for Canada qualified both it and Tesla's C$69,900 long-range Model Y for the incentive as of Friday, Transport Canada said on its website.",
			"Tesla’s Shanghai plant uses lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for the Model Y version produced there for sale in China and for export to Europe and other markets.",
			"At its factories in Texas and California, Tesla has been rolling out a more powerful battery configuration known as 4680.",
			"Tesla’s website shows the new, Canada-specific version of the Model Y has an EPA-rated range equivalent to 245 miles (394 km) on a charge. The U.S. version of the entry-level Model Y, which has all-wheel drive, has an EPA-rated range of 279 miles.",
			"The new Model Y for Canada is also cheaper than the entry-level U.S. model - $44,275 versus the current price of $46,990 for the U.S.",
			"Tesla has cut U.S. prices on Model Y variants three times since the start of the year, part of a discounting strategy to drive volume that sliced into its first quarter margin and touched off a price war on EVs.",
			"It shipped more than 271,000 Model Y and Model 3 sedans from its Shanghai factory last year to Europe and other markets, roughly a fifth of its global sales.",
			"Tesla is not alone in exporting EVs from China. Renault exports the Spring, an entry-level hatchback EV to Europe under its Dacia brand. BMW exports the iX3 from China to Southeast Asia and Europe.",
			"China’s overall car exports grew four-fold between 2020 and 2022 to top two million vehicles and are on track to top three million this year if the first-quarter pace is sustained.",

			"NEW YORK (AP) — On the 31st floor of what was once a towering office building in downtown Manhattan, construction workers lay down steel bracing for what will soon anchor a host of residential amenities: a catering station, lounge, fire pit and gas grills.",
			"The building, empty since 2021, is being converted to 588 market-rate rental apartments that will house about 1,000 people. \"We’re taking a vacant building and pouring life not only into this building, but this entire neighborhood,” said Joey Chilelli, managing director of real estate firm Vanbarton Group, which is doing the conversion.",
			"Across the country, office-to-housing conversions are being pursued as a potential lifeline for struggling downtown business districts that emptied out during the pandemic and may never fully recover. The conversion push is marked by an emphasis on affordability. Multiple cities are offering serious tax breaks for developers to incentivize office-to-housing conversions — provided that a certain percentage of apartments are offered at affordable below-market prices.",
			"In January, Pittsburgh announced it was accepting proposals to produce more affordable housing through the “conversion of fallow and underutilized office space.” Boston released a plan in October aimed at revitalizing downtown that included a push for more housing, some of which would come from office conversions. And Seattle launched a competition in April for downtown building owners and design firms to come up with conversion ideas.",
			"In the nation's capital, Mayor Muriel Bowser has made office-to-housing conversions a cornerstone of her plan to repopulate and revitalize downtown. Her “comeback plan” for the capital city, announced earlier this year, seeks to add 15,000 new downtown residents, in addition to the 25,000 who already live here.",
			"“Our job is to make sure that we are getting more people downtown,” she said at the time.",
			"But the conversion push has some skeptics. Housing advocates worry that the affordable housing requirements could get watered down. And even advocates of the model say giving tax breaks to wealthy developers isn’t the best tool to achieve the goal.",
			"“Developers who feel it’s going to benefit their bottom line will do it without an incentive,” said Erica Williams, director of the D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute. “This is a very costly proposal for an unproven program.”",
			"And, as increasing numbers of employers turn to hybrid work models, there's the question of persuading people to live downtown if they're not required to be there every day.",
			"“You have to make downtown a neighborhood — somewhere that’s living and playful and active,” Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey told an panel at the United States Conference of Mayors meeting last January.",
			"Jordan Woods, a 33-year-old federal government contractor, moved to a downtown Washington apartment in 2019, attracted in part by the appeal of walking to work. But then came the pandemic. Downtown, he said, was “like a moonscape” for more than a year.",
			"“And even before the pandemic it was still missing basic stuff like playgrounds and dog parks and a normal non-Whole Foods grocery store that I could walk to,” Woods said. “I wouldn’t say I regret it, but if I was considering the same move right now, I’m not sure I would do it.”",
			"Chuck D’Aprix, principal at Downtown Economics, a development consulting firm, said businesses and services like mid-size affordable grocery stores and day-care centers, pet supply shops, hardware stores and auto repair garages are needed to attract people to make the move. And they need to stay open past regular office hours.",
			"“A lot of those services simply aren’t available right now in small city downtowns or mid-sized city downtowns, you know, they close up at night,” D’Aprix said.",
			"But with vacancy rates at downtown office buildings continuing to rise, from 12.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019 to 17.8% in the first quarter of 2023, according to the real estate firm CBRE, there's an urgency to do something.",
			"In New York City, where the vacancy rate is 15.5%, Mayor Eric Adams announced in January a plan to bring 500,000 new homes to the city including what he calls rent-restricted units.",
			"A key piece of that plan is to rezone parts of Midtown Manhattan which currently only allow office and manufacturing spaces. The mayor's office also is pressing for approval of tax breaks that would entice developers to invest in conversions that include affordable units and other changes. Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer said the conversions could help “make a dent in this dire housing crisis that we’ve been in.”",
			"Conversions are credited with turning lower Manhattan from a neighborhood that shut down at dusk into a sought-after destination for both families and foodies.",
			"“All of a sudden, you just saw strollers and dogs, so obviously that means that people are not just coming to work. They’re actually coming to stay,\" said Ross Moskowitz, a partner at the Stroock &amp; Stroock &amp; Lavan law firm who specializes in real estate, land use and public-private partnerships.",
			"But there are challenges.",
			"“Converting buildings is not easy,” said Luke Bronin, the mayor of Hartford, Connecticut. “There are a lot of buildings that just aren’t conducive.”",
			"Issues include access to natural light and air, the absence of balconies and the need to install hundreds of bathrooms and kitchens, along with the accompanying plumbing, in buildings often constructed with just two large bathrooms per floor.",
			"There also can be environmental issues, like asbestos, said Anoop Davé, the CEO of Victrix, a real estate investment management development company specializing in converting mostly vacant office buildings into residential buildings and hotels.",
			"Christopher Nicholson, 38, a technical operations analyst, knows first-hand the pluses and minuses of living in a converted downtown office building.",
			"In 2018 he moved into a 31-story former office high-rise in downtown Denver that was built in 1967 and converted into apartments in 2006. “There was definitely a lack of green space, the nearest park is more than a half a mile away,\" he said. \"The grocery store was about a mile plus.”",
			"He moved to his current building in 2020, a 130-year-old, nine-story former office building converted in 2000. It's right by the light rail and bus stops and near hotels that have nice restaurants and cocktail bars.",
			"“I can’t imagine living anywhere else,” Nicholson said. “I think for what I get, I’m more than happy with the tradeoffs that I’ve made.\"",

			"(Bloomberg) -- S&amp;P Global Ratings took a far more downbeat view of Egypt’s finances than the International Monetary Fund and forecast a further currency depreciation in lowering the country’s outlook to negative.",
			"Though expecting enough net flows to cover Egypt’s current-account deficits through fiscal year 2026, S&amp;P projects the central bank’s gross reserves will average about $32 billion during the period — only half the level the IMF sees them reaching over the same time. The stockpile has risen above $34 billion in recent months.",
			"S&amp;P also anticipates the local currency will decline by about 53% by the end of this fiscal year to June 30, from 12 months earlier, “followed by a modest depreciation in the subsequent years,” analysts led by Trevor Cullinan said in a statement last week.",
			"The rating company affirmed Egypt at B, seven notches above default and on par with Nicaragua, Montenegro and Uganda.",
			"In S&amp;P’s view, “Egypt’s funding sources may not cover its high external financing requirements” this fiscal year and next, which it estimates at a cumulative of about $37 billion.",
			"It warned that “lack of progress” in implementing reforms announced last December increases risks that backers including wealthy Gulf allies “potentially delay or do not provide Egypt with the agreed funds, with implications for imports, inflation, interest rates, and the government’s debt stock and interest payments.”",
			"Around 70% of Egypt’s government debt is domestic and in local currency, according to S&amp;P. It estimates the government channels over two-fifths of all revenue for interest payments, the third-highest such ratio among the 137 sovereigns it rates globally.",
			"S&amp;P is the third major credit assessor to take negative action on Egypt in recent months, as the economic fallout of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine contributed to the country’s worst foreign-currency crunch and highest inflation in years.",
			"In February, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Egypt’s debt score deeper into junk territory, following a decision by Fitch Ratings last November to lower its outlook to negative from stable. While Fitch rates Egypt one step above S&amp;P, Moody’s already has it a notch lower at B3.",
			"The government has committed to allowing a more flexible exchange rate, enabling it to clinch a $3 billion deal with the IMF. Still, declines in the currency continued to be followed by long stretches of stability.",
			"S&amp;P said the IMF has “a more optimistic view” on Egypt’s gross reserves “as the balance of payments improves and program financing is disbursed.”",
			"For now, however, the IMF wants Egypt to enact more of the wide-ranging measures it pledged before carrying out the first review of its assistance program, waiting to see privatization deals for state assets and genuine flexibility in the currency.",
			"Though the pound has traded little changed in the spot market, concern among investors has built over what would be Egypt’s fourth devaluation since March 2022. The currency has weakened about 50% over the past year, but remains far stronger than rates quoted in the black market, underscoring the risk of further depreciation.",

			"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea formally restored Japan to its list of countries it gives preferential treatment in trade on Monday, three years after the neighbors downgraded each other’s trade status amid a diplomatic row fueled by historical grievances.",
			"In announcing the move through a government gazette, South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy also said Seoul will further restrict technology and industrial exports to Russia and its ally Belarus to support the U.S.-led pressure campaign against Moscow over the war in Ukraine.",
			"After years of friction, Seoul and Tokyo are working to repair relations as they tighten their three-way security cooperation with Washington to counter the threat posed by North Korea. Pyongyang has used the distractions caused by the war to accelerate testing of nuclear-capable missiles.",
			"South Korean officials expect Tokyo to restore Seoul as a favored trade partner too, but expect that step to take more time based on the procedures to revise Japan's export regulations.",
			"In September 2019, South Korea dropped Japan from its “white list” of countries receiving fast-track approvals in trade, reacting to a similar move by Tokyo. Japan had also tightened export controls on key chemicals South Korean companies use to make semiconductors and displays, prompting South Korea to file a complaint with the World Trade Organization.",
			"Seoul accused Tokyo of weaponizing trade to retaliate against South Korean court rulings that ordered Japanese companies to offer reparations to South Koreans forced into slave labor before the end of World War II, when Japan had colonized the Korean Peninsula. The 2018 rulings irked Japan, which insists all compensation issues were settled by a 1965 treaty that normalized relations. Relations between the U.S. allies began to thaw in March when the government of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who took office in May 2022, announced plans to use South Korean funds to compensate the forced laborers without requiring Japanese contributions. Yoon traveled to Tokyo to meet with Japanese Prime Minster Fumio Kishida and they vowed to rebuild the countries’ security and economic ties.",
			"Yoon’s push to mend ties with Tokyo has triggered criticism from some forced labor victims and from his political rivals. They have called for direct compensation from Japanese companies that employed the forced laborers. But Yoon has defended his decision, saying closer ties with Japan are essential for dealing with a slew of regional challenges, especially North Korea’s growing nuclear threat.",
			"Following the Yoon-Kishida summit, South Korea withdrew its complaint at the WTO against Japan as Tokyo simultaneously confirmed its removal of export controls over a set of chemicals seen as vital to South Korea’s technology industry. The Japanese restrictions had covered fluorinated polyimides, which are used in organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens for TVs and smartphones, and photoresist and hydrogen fluoride, used for making semiconductors. With Japan’s status restored, South Korea now provides preferential treatment to 29 countries –- including the United States, Britain and France –- over exports of sensitive “strategic” materials that can be used for both civilian and military purposes.",

			"Seoul’s controls so far have covered 57 items, including those related to electronics and shipbuilding, with authorities banning their shipments to Russia and Belarus unless the companies obtain special approvals. The list will increase to 798 items beginning Friday, including exports related to construction, machinery, steelmaking, automobiles, semiconductors and advanced computing.",

			"(Bloomberg) -- In front of a suburban house on the outskirts of the northern Germany city of Hamburg, a single word — “LAION” — is scrawled in pencil across a mailbox. It’s the only indication that the home belongs to the person behind a massive data gathering effort central to the artificial intelligence boom that has seized the world's attention.",
			"That person is high school teacher Christoph Schuhmann, and LAION, short for “Large-scale AI Open Network,” is his passion project. When Schuhmann isn’t teaching physics and computer science to German teens, he works with a small team of volunteers building the world’s biggest free AI training data set, which has already been used in text-to-image generators such as Google’s Imagen and Stable Diffusion.",
			"Databases like LAION are central to AI text-to-image generators, which rely on them for the enormous amounts of visual material used to deconstruct and create new images. The debut of these products late last year was a paradigm-shifting event: it sent the tech sector’s AI arms race into hyperdrive and raised a myriad of ethical and legal issues. Within a matter of months, lawsuits had been filed against generative AI companies Stability AI and Midjourney for copyright infringement, and critics were sounding the alarm about the violent, sexualized, and otherwise problematic images within their datasets, which have been accused of introducing biases that are nearly impossible to mitigate.",
			"But these aren’t Schuhmann’s concerns. He just wants to set the data free.",
			"Large Language",
			"The 40-year-old teacher and trained actor helped found LAION two years ago after hanging out on a Discord server for AI enthusiasts. The first iteration of OpenAI’s DALL-E, a deep learning model that generates digital images from language prompts — say, creating an image of a pink chicken sitting on a sofa in response to such a request — had just been released, and Schuhmann was both inspired and concerned that it would encourage big tech companies to make more data proprietary.“I instantly understood that if this is centralized to one, two or three companies, it will have really bad effects for society,” Schuhmann said.",
			"In response, he and other members on the server decided to create an open-source dataset to help train image-to-text diffusion models, a months-long process similar to teaching someone a foreign language with millions of flash cards. The group used raw HTML code collected by the California nonprofit Common Crawl to locate images around the web and associate them with descriptive text. It does not use any manual or human curation.",
			"Within a few weeks, Schuhmann and his colleagues had 3 million image-text pairs. After three months, they released a dataset with 400 million pairs. That number is now over 5 billion, making LAION the largest free dataset of images and captions.",
			"As LAION’s reputation grew, the team worked without pay, receiving a one-off donation in 2021 from the machine-learning company Hugging Face. Then one day, a former hedge fund manager entered the Discord chat.",
			"Emad Mostaque offered to cover the costs of computing power, no strings attached. He wanted to launch his own open-source generative AI business and was keen to tap LAION to train his product. The team initially scoffed at the proposal, taking him for a kook.",
			"“We were very skeptical in the beginning,” Schuhmann said, “But after four weeks or so we got access to GPUs in the cloud that would normally have cost around $9,000 or $10,000.”",
			"When Mostaque launched Stability AI in 2022, he used LAION’s dataset for Stable Diffusion, its flagship AI image generator, and hired two of the organization’s researchers. A year on, the company is currently seeking a $4 billion valuation, thanks largely to the data made available by LAION. For his part, Schuhmann hasn’t profited from LAION and says he isn’t interested in doing so. “I’m still a high school teacher. I have rejected job offers from all different kinds of companies because I wanted this to stay independent,” he said.",
			"New Oil?",
			"Many of the images and links in databases like LAION have been sitting in plain sight on the web, in some cases for decades. It took the AI boom to reveal its true value, as the bigger and more diverse a dataset is, and the higher quality the images in it, the clearer and more precise an AI-generated image will be.",
			"That realization, in turn, has raised a number of legal and ethical questions about whether publicly-available materials can be used to feed databases — and if the answer is yes, if creators should be paid.",
			"To build LAION, founders scraped visual data from companies such as Pinterest, Shopify and Amazon Web Services — which did not comment on whether LAION’s use of their content violates their terms of service — as well as YouTube thumbnails, images from portfolio platforms like DeviantArt and EyeEm, photos from government websites including the US Department of Defense, and content from news sites such as The Daily Mail and The Sun.",
			"If you ask Schuhmann, he says that anything freely available online is fair game. But there is currently no AI regulation in the European Union, and the forthcoming AI Act, whose language will be finalized early this summer, will not rule on whether copyrighted materials can be included in big data sets. Rather, lawmakers are discussing whether to include a provision requiring the companies behind AI generators to disclose what materials went into the data sets their products were trained on, thus giving the creators of those materials the option of taking action.",
			"The basic idea behind the provision, European Parliament Member Dragos Tudorache told Bloomberg, is simple: “As a developer of generative AI, you have an obligation to document and be transparent about the copyrighted material that you have used in the training of algorithms.”",
			"Such regulation wouldn’t be an issue for Stability AI, but it could be a problem for other text-to-image generators — “no one knows what Open AI actually used to train DALL-E 2,” Schuhmann said, citing it as an example of how tech companies lock up public data. It would also upend what is now the status quo in data collection.",
			"“It has become a tradition within the field to just assume you don’t need consent or you don’t need to inform people, or they don’t even have to be aware of it. There is a sense of entitlement that whatever is on the web, you can just crawl it and put it in a data set,” said Abeba Birhane, a Senior Fellow in Trustworthy AI at Mozilla Foundation who has studied LAION.",
			"Although LAION has not been sued directly, it has been named in two lawsuits: one accusing Stability and Midjourney of using copyrighted images by artists to train their models, and another by Getty Images against Stability, which alleges that 12 million of its images were scraped by LAION and used to train Stable Diffusion.",
			"Because LAION is open-source, it’s impossible to know which or how many other companies have used the dataset. Google has acknowledged that it tapped LAION to help train its Imagen and Parti AI text-to-image models. Schuhmann believes that other large companies are quietly doing the same and simply not disclosing it.",
			"Worst of the Web",
			"Sitting in the living room as his son played Minecraft, Schuhmann likened LAION to a “small research boat” on top of “big information technology tsunami,” taking samples of what’s beneath to display to the world.",
			"“This is a tiny amount of what’s available publicly on the Internet,” he said of LAION’s database. “It’s really easy to get because even we, with maybe a budget of $10,000 from donors, can do it.”",
			"But what’s publicly available isn’t always what the public wants — or is legally allowed to see. In addition to SFW photos of cats and firetrucks, LAION’s dataset contains millions of images of pornography, violence, child nudity, racist memes, hate symbols, copyrighted art, and works scraped from private company websites. Schuhmann said he was unaware of any child nudity in LAION’s data set, though he acknowledged he did not review the data in great depth. If notified about such content, he said, he would remove links to it immediately.",
			"Schuhman consulted lawyers and ran an automated tool to filter out illegal content before he began assembling the database, but he is less interested in sanitizing LAION’s holdings than in learning from them. “We could have filtered out violence from the data we released,” he said, “but we decided not to because it will speed up the development of violence detection software.” LAION does provide a takedown form to request the removal of photos, but the dataset has already been downloaded thousands of times.",
			"Offensive content lifted from LAION appears to have been integrated into Stable Diffusion, where despite recently tightened filters, it’s easy to generate fake Islamic State beheading photos or Holocaust images. Some experts believe such material can also create biases within an AI generator itself: Tools like Dall-E-2 and Stable Diffusion have been criticized for reproducing racial stereotypes even when a text prompt doesn’t imply the subject’s race.",
			"Such biases were why Google decided not to release Imagen, which had been trained on LAION.",
			"When reached for comment, Stability AI said it trained Stable Diffusion on a curated subset of LAION’s database. The company sought to “give the model a much more diverse and wide-ranging dataset than that of the original SD” it wrote in an email, adding that they tried to remove “adult content using LAION’s NSFW filter.”",
			"Even advocates of open source-based AI warn of the implications of training AI on uncurated datasets. According to Yacine Jernite, who leads the Machine Learning and Society team at Hugging Face, generative AI tools based on tainted data will reflect its biases. “The model is a very direct reflection of what it’s trained on.”",
			"Introducing guardrails after the product is up and running isn’t sufficient, Jernite added, as users will always find ways to circumvent the safety measures. “That’s what happens when you take a model that is trained to emulate what people do on the Internet in general and then say, ‘Okay, but don’t do that.’ People will find a way to still make it do that,” they said.",
			"Gil Elbaz, founder of the data nonprofit Common Crawl, doubts whether “there’s a straight line that you can draw from the training sets to what’s produced,” and instead likened the process to an artist who goes to museums for inspiration but is blocked from making replicas of artworks. Instead, he said, “it’s important for society to decide what use cases are legal or not legal.”",
			"It won’t only be left up to society. As regulators in Europe craft legislation to navigate the uses of artificial intelligence, they are grappling with the fact that the data now being mined for the current AI boom has for years been generated in in a legal gray zone that is only now coming under serious scrutiny. “AI wouldn’t have been possible at this level of complexity without years of the accumulation of data,” said Tudorache, the European Parliament member.",
			"But to Schuhmann, it’s not the datasets that should be monitored. In his eyes, the worst-case scenario for AI is one in which Big Tech is able to crowd out developers by catering their tools to a regulatory framework. “If we try to slow things down and over-regulate,” he warned, “there is a big danger that in the end, only a few big corporate players can afford to fulfill all the formal requirements.”",

			"(Bloomberg) -- Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s ruling party eked out wins in four of five Japanese by-elections held Sunday, as speculation simmers over whether he will call an early general election.",
			"The premier’s Liberal Democratic Party kept the three seats it previously held of the five, including the constituency in the southwestern prefecture of Yamaguchi vacated when former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was assassinated last year. It also picked up a fourth, an upper house seat in Oita Prefecture.",
			"The victories may add to momentum for Kishida to call a national election after hosting the Group of Seven summit May 19-21 in Hiroshima. Still, the LDP won by a slim margin in some constituencies and lost in Wakayama, where Kishida had campaigned for his party’s candidate and faced a pipe-bomb attack earlier this month.",
			"“While it was a close call, the LDP won,” said independent political analyst Harumi Arima. “It’s quite possible that he will announce an election after the summit and before the end of the parliamentary session,” he added. The current session is scheduled to end June 21.",
			"An early poll could play into monetary policy, as the Bank of Japan would likely face pressure to avoid any changes during the campaign that could disrupt markets. The bank holds its first policy meeting under new Governor Kazuo Ueda on Thursday and Friday.",
			"Among the LDP’s successful candidates was a 34-year-old woman of Uyghur heritage who has said she wants to break down the “old boys’ club” of Japanese politics. The multilingual Arfiya Eri, representing a constituency in Chiba, near Tokyo, will become one of a tiny number of naturalized Japanese lawmakers.",
			"“We were able to increase the number of seats for the ruling LDP,” Kishida told reporters Monday. “I take this as encouragement to push through with the policy issues we have raised.” He denied he was thinking of calling a general election now.",
			"While Japan’s lower house term doesn’t end until 2025, renewing his mandate could help Kishida keep his party in line as he negotiates a series of difficult policy decisions. Among them are how the deeply indebted country will fund a pledged 60% increase in defense spending amid rising regional threats, as well as a planned doubling of outlays on children and families intended to stem a fall in the nation’s birthrate.",
			"Support for Kishida’s cabinet has recovered in recent weeks, helped by his visit to Ukraine last month as well as progress toward a rapprochement with South Korea. His decision to carry on campaigning after an attempted pipe-bomb attack as he was about to speak in support of a candidate in Wakayama also nudged him higher in media polls. Even so, the seat went to the opposition Japan Innovation Party.",
			"“It’s not certain that there will be an election, because this wasn’t a landslide victory for the LDP,” said Hideo Kumano, executive economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute, who added that the mixed result meant the premier and the BOJ would both favor a dovish stance that pleases the public. “At this point, the possibility of a massive policy shift is pretty much gone,” he added.",

			"After dropping 37% since the start of the year, JD.com trails all its peers in the benchmark Hang Seng Tech Index, as well as a gauge of Chinese shares traded in Hong Kong. A slow and uneven recovery from the Covid slump, in addition to growing competition from rivals PDD Holdings Inc. and ByteDance Ltd., has led the likes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS Group AG to cut their estimates.",
			"JD.com’s struggles are emblematic of the challenges faced by China’s online retailers. Demand for big-ticket items is still weak — bad news for a company which counts on electronics and home appliances for half its sales. The stock’s 77% gain from an October low to a January peak has all but vanished.",
			"“Investors dislike uncertainty and here we have uncertainty from a number of angles,” said Adam Montanaro, investment director of global emerging-markets equities at abrdn Plc. “The stock will likely remain in the penalty box until management can prove they can continue to evidence margin expansion and better evidence their competitive moat.”",
			"Signs of cracks in the shares’ rally started to appear in February amid reports that JD.com was rolling out a 10 billion-yuan ($1.5 billion) discount campaign to fend off a challenge from PDD’s budget shopping app Pinduoduo, which has years of experience in offering mass-scale subsidies.",
			"While JD.com has consistently excelled in value-added services such as delivery and after-sales support, it’s difficult for the company to beat Pinduoduo on price wars and promotions, according to Xiadong Bao, fund manager at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management. “Visibility is low and investors prefer to wait before the company delivers on earnings,” Bao said.",
			"Grounds for optimism receded further in March when the company warned that a robust recovery in consumption is unlikely to materialize until the second half. China’s latest economic data reflect the uncertainties: while retail sales soared last month, industrial output growth is still below pre-pandemic rates and the nationwide urban jobless rate remains elevated.",
			"To make matters worse, investors were caught off guard this month by reports of organizational changes in JD.com’s logistics and retail arms — an overhaul that Barclays Plc analyst Jiong Shao expects to cause near-term business disruption. Another initiative to move some products to third-party merchants is set to hit sales in coming quarters, Shao wrote in a note.",
			"Analysts now expect the online retailer’s revenue growth to slow to 5.8% in 2023 from 10% in 2022, well below a projected gain of 28% for PDD. Their price targets have also been tumbling, with an average decline of more than 9% since March 24 the most among all Hang Seng Tech Index members.",
			"The pessimism is reflected in a valuation that at 12.6 times forward one-year earnings is the cheapest ever, although the stock is still pricier than China’s e-commerce bellwether Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.",
			"“The now lowly valuation suggests it could be an interesting time to add for patient investors,” said abrdn’s Montanaro.",
			"For now though, the stock appears to lack a near-term spark. JD.com is still readying its large language model for a launch later this year while rivals Baidu Inc. and Alibaba have had a head start on AI chatbots. Alibaba also is gaining attention with its plan to split its $250 billion empire into six business units.",
			"“Investors who want to do some rebalancing within the Chinese tech sector would choose to long Alibaba or Tencent, to bet on a sharper business turnaround,” said Kenny Wen, head of investment strategy at KGI Asia Ltd.",

			"(Bloomberg) -- Global oil traders are fixated on the next milestone in China’s economic recovery, when travelers pack their bags and head to the airport for the Golden Week holiday in early May.",
			"Some 170 million Chinese holidayed abroad in 2019, before the pandemic struck. That figure sank to less than 9 million last year at the height of China’s lockdowns. The likelihood of dramatically more air travel explains why jet fuel consumption in China is widely seen as the single biggest driver of world oil demand growth this year, according to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.",
			"The signs are encouraging. About 9 million air passenger trips will be made during the holidays starting April 29, state broadcaster CCTV reported Friday, citing data from Civil Aviation Administration of China. That compares with 6.9 million journeys over the period in 2019, CCTV said.",
			"“Mainland China’s domestic jet fuel demand has almost fully recovered, while international jet fuel demand has recovered to close to 70% of pre-Covid levels,” said Fenglei Shi, a director covering Chinese oil markets at S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. As such, it’s possible that Golden Week could mark a near-complete recovery in China’s total consumption of the fuel, she said.",
			"Overseas ticket searches for Golden Week are 120% of the level in 2019, state media reported, citing an estimate from Trip.com. As of April 18, actual bookings were more than 10 times that of last year, the Securities Daily reported.",
			"The global oil market has been caught between two competing themes this year: advanced economies teetering on recession, and the promise that China’s reopening could dramatically lift demand after a three-year blight on consumption due to Beijing’s Covid restrictions. Crude has fallen in recent days as the US economy stalls and the prospect of more interest rate hikes adds to headwinds for prices.",
			"If Golden Week delivers a big boost to air travel, it will signal that demand is back on track and support some of the more bullish views on prices. But too few passengers will be further evidence of a relatively muted Chinese reopening that has disappointed commodities markets craving a return to normality in their biggest buyer.",
			"The latest economic data augurs well for a rebound. Retail sales shot higher in March as households opened their wallets to spend on services, and Golden Week is likely to unleash more pent-up demand for tourism. While domestic trips have shown a strong recovery, outbound flights have lagged due to fewer planes, expensive fares and residual restrictions on international travel.",
			"The mainland’s total number of passenger flights should nearly equal pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter, according to a forecast from the China Air Transport Association. But the international component of that will still be less than half what it was — and overseas flights account for about 30% of the nation’s jet fuel consumption, according to BloombergNEF.",
			"Jet fuel will be the biggest component of China’s demand recovery this year because “it was a laggard and it was the one that has not caught up,” said Macquarie Group strategist Vikas Dwivedi, although he cautioned that Chinese consumption could end up being “good enough but not great.”",
			"Macquarie estimates that Chinese jet fuel demand will rise by 430,000 barrels a day this year over last. That’s almost half of the increase of 900,000 barrels forecast for Chinese oil demand as a whole as its vast economy reopens. And it’s more than a third of the global demand growth for jet fuel of 1.2 million barrels predicted by the International Energy Agency.",

			"LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - Global primary aluminium production grew by 2.0% year-on-year to 16.9 million tonnes in the first three months of 2023, according to the latest monthly assessment from the International Aluminium Institute (IAI).",
			"The headline growth figure flatters to deceive.",
			"Production outside of China is flat-lining, with restarts and curtailments largely cancelling each other out.",
			"China, which accounts for just under 60% of the world's primary metal production, lifted output by 3.9% relative to the first quarter of 2022, but the growth rate slowed sharply to just 0.9% in March.",
			"Expressed in terms of annualised run-rates, China's output of 39.9 million tonnes last month was the lowest in a year and down by 1.6 million tonnes from August's record 41.5 million.",
			"New and restarted capacity is failing to offset lower production in the hydro-rich province of Yunnan, where power-hungry smelters have been ordered to reduce operations to help cope with a severe drought.",
			"China's aluminium production is now highly dependent on weather patterns in the south of the country. So too is the global aluminium market.",
			"PRAYING FOR RAIN",
			"Yunnan province accounts for around 12% of China's aluminium capacity and produced 4.2 million tonnes in 2022.",
			"It has been a fast-growing production hub as Chinese operators have migrated from coal-powered provinces in a quest to produce low-carbon \"green\" aluminium using hydro energy.",
			"Hydro power, however, requires rainfall and Yunnan is experiencing its worst drought in decades.",
			"The provincial capital Kunming, which has received only 10% of its normal precipitation so far this year, earlier this week issued an orange drought alert, the second most severe warning in a four-tiered system. Many other towns have done the same, according to China Daily.",
			"Industrial energy users, including aluminium smelters, have been instructed to reduce operations to balance the power system.",
			"Around two million tonnes of the province's production capacity is now off-line, according to Li Jiahui, an analyst at consultancy Shanghai Metals Market, speaking at a conference in Zhengzhou.",
			"While other provinces have restarted capacity or even brought on new electrolysis lines, the impact has failed to offset the losses in Yunnan.",
			"In theory things will turn around with the approaching rainy season, but in practice it will depend on just how much rain falls and whether there will be sufficient guaranteed power to allow smelters to commit to the costs of reactivating idled capacity.",
			"WESTERN PRODUCTION FLAT-LINES",
			"Primary aluminium production outside of China was flat year-on-year in the first quarter.",
			"Only two regions registered significant changes relative to the first three months of 2022.",
			"Latin American production surged by 24% thanks to the ramp-up of the Alumar smelter in Brazil, which is being restarted after six years of care and maintenance, and the return to full operations of the Aluar plant in Argentina.",

			"LUXEMBOURG, April 24 (Reuters) - Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba gets a chance on Monday to vent Kyiv's frustration to European Union foreign ministers over wrangling that is holding up an EU plan to buy ammunition to help Ukraine fight Russia's invasion.",
			"Kuleba expressed frustration in a tweet last week that a landmark deal for EU countries to jointly buy artillery shells for Ukraine has not yet been implemented due to disagreements over how much of the business has to stay within Europe.",
			"\"The inability of the EU to implement its own decision on the joint procurement of ammunition for Ukraine is frustrating,\" Kuleba said on Thursday.",
			"\"For Ukraine, the cost of inaction is measured in human lives,\" he warned.",
			"Kuleba can make his case directly when he discusses the state of the war and Ukraine's needs by video link to a regular meeting of EU foreign ministers, taking place in Luxembourg. EU diplomats say they expect him to do so.",
			"Artillery rounds, particularly 155mm shells, have become critical to the conflict as Ukrainian and Russian forces wage an intense war of attrition. Officials say Kyiv is burning through more rounds than its allies can currently produce.",
			"The joint procurement plan is part of a multi-track EU deal to get 1 million artillery shells or missiles to Ukraine within 12 months and ramp up European munitions production, approved by foreign ministers last month.",
			"The first element is the most immediate. It sets aside 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) to reimburse EU governments for sending munitions to Ukraine from existing stocks.",
			"EU officials pushed back against Kuleba's criticism by stressing that this fast track is up and running so ammunition is already flowing to Kyiv.",
			"But the second track, worth another 1 billion euros to fund joint procurement, has yet to be finalised.",
			"EU countries agreed to buy the munitions from firms from the EU and from Norway, which has close economic ties to the bloc.",
			"But diplomats say France - a champion of a stronger EU defence sector, with a substantial arms industry of its own - has insisted production itself should take place in Europe.",
			"That stance has frustrated other EU members, including Germany, the Netherlands and Poland. They have expressed scepticism that European industry has the capacity to produce enough shells quickly.",
			"EU officials and diplomats said they expected an agreement that would satisfy all sides in the coming days. But some had previously suggested a deal would come last week, after Easter holidays, only to see those hopes dashed.",
			"\"We should not lose sight of what our goal is here and that is helping Ukraine,\" said an EU diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.

			"(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin’s rebound is just the start of a rally that will take it past $50,000 next year courtesy of a process known as halving that curbs the supply of new tokens, according to projections from crypto analysts.",
			"The largest digital asset has climbed 67% since Dec. 31 in a partial revival from an epic rout in 2022. While the token at the moment is struggling in the vicinity of $30,000, halving holds the potential to trigger an advance of at least 81%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence and Matrixport.",
			"A halving – or halvening – cuts in half the amount of tokens that Bitcoin miners receive as reward for their work. The quadrennial event is due next around April 2024 and is part of the process of capping Bitcoin supply at 21 million tokens. The coin hit records after each of the last three halvings.",
			"The upcoming halving is currently about 50% priced in based on previous cycles, said Jamie Douglas Coutts, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. Coutts predicts that Bitcoin can scale $50,000 by April 2024.",
			"“Bitcoin cycles bottom around 12-18 months prior to the halving and this cycle structure looks similar to the past ones, albeit many things have changed — while the network is vastly stronger, Bitcoin has never endured a prolonged severe economic contraction,” he said.",
			"The Bitcoin bounce has sputtered of late, restrained by cooling expectations of Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts amid persistent inflation. A US regulatory crackdown on crypto in the wake of the FTX exchange’s collapse in November 2022 also threatens to darken the market outlook.",
			"FTX Low",
			"“If the collapse of FTX was indeed the bottom of this cycle, then history would suggest that we still have approximately 350 days of ‘accumulation’ before witnessing the characteristic post-halving breakout price action,” said Jacob Joseph, an analyst at CCData.",
			"Markus Thielen, research head at Matrixport, said in a recent note that Bitcoin will reach around $65,623 by April 2024 — more than double the current price.",
			"Bitcoin remains about $41,000 down from its all-time high of almost $69,000 in November 2021 — which came 18 months after its 2020 halving. Crypto markets crashed last year as central banks jacked up rates to curb price pressures and digital-asset companies imploded.",
			"“Bitcoin may once again reach a new all-time high in the future, however, it is unlikely to see the same growth as previous cycles due to increased market size and competition from other digital assets,” said CCData’s Joseph.",
			"Bitcoin edged up less than 0.5% to $27,590 as of 8 a.m. in Singapore on Monday after retreating a little more than 9% last week. Smaller tokens like Ether, Cardano and Solana also made modest gains as the trading week got underway in the Asia-Pacific region.",

Elsewhere, the BNEF Summit gets underway in New York, while deal watchers will be focused on a Teck Resources Ltd. shareholder vote on splitting up the company — with the outcome dictating the future of Glencore Plc’s $23 billion takeover bid. Here are five notable charts to consider in global commodity markets as the week gets underway.",
			"Big Oil",
			"Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and TotalEnergies SE all report earnings this week, followed by Shell Plc and BP Plc in early May. Even though all five posted blowout profits in 2022, adjusted net income is set to cool in the first quarter thanks to softening oil and gas prices. Combined, the biggest western oil companies are forecast to have made $36.5 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While that’s down more than 40% from the peak in the second quarter of 2022, it would still mark the seventh-highest level recorded since the mega-mergers of the 2000s created the companies in their current form.",
			"Jet Fuel",
			"Keep an eye on China air travel. After punishing Covid restrictions, the country is returning to the skies and the pace is expected to accelerate heading into the Golden Week holiday next month. Jet fuel demand reached nearly 75% of its pre-pandemic levels in the week ended April 15, according to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., while international flights to and from the country continue to climb. The likelihood of increased air travel in the coming weeks explains why jet fuel consumption in China is widely seen as the single biggest driver of world oil demand growth this year, analysts from the bank said. Meanwhile, fuel consumption in the rest of the world is also picking up, BloombergNEF data show.",
			"Shipping",
			"Sticking with China, let’s take a look at its ports where container boxes of imported goods are stacking up despite improved economic data. While the economy grew at the fastest pace in a year in the first quarter, ports like the world’s largest in Shanghai are handling more incoming boxes than exports, according to data from Container xChange. That’s because of a slump in demand from major export destinations such as the US and Europe, where economic uncertainty is still weighing on consumer appetite. In Shanghai, inbound containers are consistently making up about 64% of the total number of containers at the port. That’s a far cry from January 2021, when exports accounted for the bulk of activity.

			"(Bloomberg) -- This week may prove crucial for the currency market’s favorite sentiment gauge — the risk-sensitive Australian dollar versus the haven yen — as investors wait to see if it can finally break out of its seven-month downtrend.",
			"The Aussie dollar-yen is in focus after it rebounded from a one-year low last month as traders put aside concerns over the global banking sector. However, the pair may renew its decline if data on Wednesday show Australian inflation cooled off in the first quarter and if the Bank of Japan leaves room for hawkish tweaks to its super-easy policy at Friday’s meeting.",
			"“I am cautious about extrapolating Aussie dollar-yen strength too far,” says John Bromhead, a currency strategist at Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Sydney. “We are trading toward the top of recent ranges in equities and we think there is some value in short positions in Aussie-yen as we approach the start of May, which is typically a period of seasonal weakness for the Aussie.”",
			"A drop in the Aussie dollar-yen may also prove to be a canary in the coal mine for other risk-sensitive currency pairs given concerns about a recession in the US later this year. Over in equities a rally looks to have stalled with the S&amp;P 500 on the cusp of climbing into a technical bull market.",
			"While new BOJ Governor Ueda said earlier this month the central bank’s policy is appropriate, that hasn’t stopped some investors from predicting he will at least end up tweaking yield curve control. That’s because he’s already admitted to seeing positive signs in prices and wages, keeping the door open for a yen rally should the central bank keep alive bets on possible pivot.",
			"Ueda Faces BOJ Bets That Won’t Go Away at Debut Decision",
			"Meanwhile, an Australian inflation surprise could firm up expectations for the Reserve Bank’s next monetary policy decision on May 2. Minutes of the central bank’s April meeting signaled it needs additional data before it can decide on whether another 25 basis points rate increase is required.",
			"“Aussie-yen will find further support in the near term if the market needs to price in more of a chance of another rate hike by the RBA,” says David Forrester, senior FX strategist at Credit Agricole CIB Singapore Branch, “However, upside will be limited by investor reluctance to get short the yen given the lingering risks of a sudden change by the BOJ, the return of US banking concerns and the US debt ceiling.”",

It aims to trim $4.5 trillion in spending over a decade, in part by cutting discretionary spending by $130 billion next year and capping its growth at 1%.",

			"“We are the only ones who are putting a responsible plan out that will raise the debt limit,” McCarthy said. He said he wants the bill to form the basis of talks on a compromise and he’d be open to a larger debt ceiling increase that staves off a default past next March.",

			"Though tech M&amp;A has stalled, there's one area within the sector that's popping — information, data, and analytics, according to a report recently released by Solomon Partners.",
			"It's not exactly the sexiest of sectors, but its importance has increased as economic uncertainty has grown, said Solomon Partners Managing Director Joe Watson. However, it's also a sector — as characterized by companies like Verisk (<a class=\"link\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" data-ylk=\"slk:VRSK;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VRSK/\">VRSK</a>), Moody's, and Equifax — that has been on the upswing for some time.",
			"\"The information and data services sector is one that has become increasingly valuable over the last ten to fifteen years, as companies have realized it's necessary to get data to drive decision-making,\" Watson said. \"The entire industry has developed and come increasingly into focus.\"",
			"And, geopolitical and economic volatility has a way of crystallizing the importance of specialized data providers.",
			"\"Out of the financial crisis, the sector also saw a spike in interest,\" Watson told Yahoo Finance. \"It's too early to say how much of it is tied to SVB, but we do know from history that times of crisis make businesses that provide data and information more important. After all, when do you most want information — when things are good or when they're bad?\"",
			"So the investment has followed. Despite a 14% decline in overall deal volume, information, data, and analytics M&amp;A jumped from 16 transactions in the fourth quarter of last year to 35 transactions in the first quarter of 2023, the report states. The same is true of capital raises — there were 10 done by funds targeting the sector at the end of last year and 17 in Q1 of 2023.",
			"These aren't earth-shattering deals, to be sure. But in a market where dealmaking is barely moving, it's notable.",
			"For example, one of the deals that got done this quarter was financial services company Wilshire's creation of Wilshire Indexes, a separate entity and new data-focused venture with the Financial Times and Singapore Exchange.",
			"Tech dealmakers are trapped in a prisoner's dilemma of sorts. It's not that they don't have the dry powder, the problem is one of flow – as exits have been down, so has fundraising from LPs in the U.S.",
			"\"Sponsors are both keen to be buyers and will look to exit older investments,\" said Watson. \"I think what's happening is in the current market uncertainty and interest rates, sponsors are asking a lot of questions, including 'Are we headed into a recession?' If you go and buy something, there's the concern that we could still be in a challenged market in six months.\"",
			"Since dealmakers don't know where the macroeconomic environment will be in the near-term, there's also a lot of fuzziness about what a successful deal even looks like right now.",
			"\"There's uncertainty around what good looks like, what bad looks like, and what average looks like,\" said Watson. \"Once a few deals start to happen and once interest rates start to be certain, we'll see that inertia in the market start to loosen once interest rate uncertainty recedes.\"",
			"So, the basic conditions are there for dealmaking to pick up in a major way – the question is when.",
			"\"For whatever reason, we haven't quite seen the dam break... If you look at the charts and data, it says there are theoretically the fundamentals in place for deals to come to market and get done, it's just a matter of when.\"",

			"(Bloomberg) -- Glencore Plc’s attempt to seal mining’s biggest deal in a decade has thrust Chief Executive Officer Gary Nagle into center stage. Little known outside Glencore before taking the job nearly two years ago, the energetic South African is pursuing one of mining’s most unattainable targets, in a bitter brawl that’s headed for a potential climax this week.",
			"While the bid for Canada’s Teck Resources Ltd. is Nagle’s first major move as CEO, the deal itself was dreamed up under his predecessor Ivan Glasenberg, who privately tried and failed to get it done in 2020. Nagle was involved in those efforts too, according to people familiar with the matter, as head of Glencore’s coal business and already earmarked to replace the man that hired him two decades earlier.",
			"Three years later, Glencore under Nagle is trying again. It has proposed a $23 billion takeover of Teck, with a plan to create two new companies from the combination — one focused on metals and the other that produces coal. It’s a company-defining deal that would reshape Glencore’s own business while swallowing up one of the last big Canadian miners.",
			"Teck has rejected Glencore’s approaches, saying investors should support its own plan to spin off its coal mines before it’s willing to entertain offers. Crucially, that view is backed by Norman Keevil, the Canadian mining patriarch whose family’s “supervoting” shares give him a veto on any big decisions. For decades, the Keevil stake meant that Teck was viewed as untouchable across the industry, even as rivals coveted its mines.",
			"Read: Teck Mining Magnate Stands Between Glencore and Mega Deal",
			"“This was always going to be speculative given Teck’s shareholding,” said Ben Davis, an analyst at Liberum in London.",
			"Teck’s other investors will get a say on Wednesday in a vote on its spinoff plan, which Glencore has sought to frame as a referendum on whether Teck’s board should abandon the split and enter talks. Should investors approve Teck’s strategy, Nagle’s pursuit will probably be over, at least for now. If they don’t, Glencore said it’s willing to make a higher offer.",
			"There’s a lot at stake for 48-year-old Nagle and Glencore. Buying Teck is a deal the company has worked on for years, presenting an opportunity to consolidate its control of one of the world’s best copper mining complexes while offering a neat solution for its profitable but polluting coal business.",
			"Read Javier Blas: Will Glencore Go From Predator to Mining M&amp;A Prey?",
			"Glencore would overnight go from being the world’s biggest coal shipper to a company with no exposure to the dirtiest fuel at all. It would also become one of the biggest metal miners, poised to benefit from surging demand as the global economy decarbonizes.",
			"Such a transformation would define Nagle’s early leadership of a company that’s long been dominated by two figures — founder and legendary fugitive trader Marc Rich, and Glasenberg, Nagle’s predecessor who built the company in its current form and remains its biggest shareholder.",
			"Glencore has a long history of aggressive moves, not all of which succeeded. As well as failing to convince Teck’s previous management team, Glasenberg tried unsuccessfully to merge with mining giant Rio Tinto Group in 2014.",
			"Glencore’s willingness to separate its coal business for the Teck deal also threatens to reopen the question of whether the company should get out of coal even if the bid fails.",
			"Glencore says nothing has changed — it will exit its coal business when shareholders say they want it to — but the structure of the Teck proposal provided the first concrete sign that the company was considering such a move.",
			"Read: Glencore’s Bid for Teck Shows It’s Willing to Abandon Coal",
			"Glencore’s overtures have been given short shrift by Teck. The company has branded the approach as opportunistic, as it starts up a huge new copper mine, and pointed to differences in the two cultures, including Glencore’s record of bribery and price fixing. Teck says other mining companies have expressed interest in a deal after the coal spinoff and dangled the prospect of a bidding war.",
			"“Glencore, quite frankly, has been rather clever at maybe jumping the gun before others have been able to put together offers,” said Peter Letko, co-founder of Montreal-based Letko Brosseau &amp; Associates Inc., who said he will vote in favor of Teck’s spinoff. “Given a little time you’ll see broader interest and a real competitive bidding for these assets.”",
			"The vote on Wednesday requires two-thirds support from both types of shares, and Teck’s biggest investors have yet to say which way they will go. Teck will be able to see the initial results and could delay or cancel the vote if it’s heading for a loss.",
			"Teck’s Keevil has also sought to undermine Nagle’s influence. In a statement a week ago, he referred to Glasenberg as a “smart man” whose timing was good for Glencore rather than Teck, but failed to mention Glencore’s current CEO.",
			"Read: Teck’s Keevil Says He’s Open to Deals After Planned Split",
			"Glencore, under Glasenberg, first approached Teck in 2020. After six months of talks, based around a similar structure that Glencore has proposed again now, Teck said it was not interested.",
			"Nagle made his first attempt to succeed where his predecessor failed at London’s annual metal gathering last October, according to people familiar with the matter. Teck had just undergone its own leadership change — Don Lindsay, who ran the company for nearly two decades, handed over to his chief financial officer, Jonathan Price at the end of September.",
			"Nagle pitched his idea over breakfast to his new counterpart, a relative newcomer to Teck who joined in 2020 from industry leader BHP Group. What followed was a series of communications through a London banker who worked as an intermediary. Price and Nagle met again at Davos in January.",
			"Then, in mid-February, Teck announced a plan to split its company in half instead. After years of weighing options for its two main business — copper and zinc mines that straddle the Americas and a chain of coal mines in British Columbia — Teck had finally made a decision: coal would become its own company, but would remain economically linked to the metal mines for another six years.",
			"Read: Teck Resources to Spin Off Coal and Simplify Share Structure",
			"Inside Glencore, Teck’s announcement set the clock ticking. Within months, the door would slam shut on its own long-coveted deal. It made its proposal in late March, and a week later Teck announced its rejection.",
			"Glencore’s bid for Teck marks the public return to mega deals by the world’s biggest miners, as rising demand for metals like copper and nickel to facilitate the green-energy transition helps revive the industry’s appetite for acquisitions.",
			"The largest producers have spent a decade on the sidelines after a series of disastrous deals during the 2000s commodities boom. During that period, nearly every big name in mining either disappeared or became one of the handful of behemoths that denominate the sector today.",
			"The exceptions mostly had one thing in common: a single family or large shareholder that didn’t want to sell. For Chilean copper miner Antofagasta Plc it was the Luksic family, for Teck it was the Keevils.",
			"Read: Mega Miners Are Hunting for Deals After Decade on the Sidelines",
			"Teck has also sought to frame the battle as a defense of Canadian mining, after many of its rivals were swallowed up during the last takeover frenzy.",
			"For Glencore to be successful, there are some serious obstacles to overcome. Glencore cannot buy Teck without the support of Keevil, who has so far been blunt in his refusal. The company would also have to muster wider shareholder support at a time when mining investors have been demanding weighty premiums — BHP and Rio Tinto both recently bought copper miners at around a 50% premium. China’s sovereign wealth fund is the biggest holder of Teck’s Class B shares, with about 10%.",
			"Still, while this is Nagle’s first big deal as CEO, he has some experienced heads at his side. As well as Glasenberg, Nagle has veteran dealmaker Michael Klein. Bloomberg reported on Friday Glencore has been working with Klein as well as Citigroup Inc. on the Teck bid, continuing a longstanding relationship after Klein previously acted as a go-between in the negotiations to take over Glencore’s sister company Xstrata a decade ago.",
			"Read: Klein Emerges From Credit Suisse Saga With Glencore-Teck Role",
			"Since Teck went public in rejecting Glencore’s offer, Nagle has traveled relentlessly to meet with shareholders and muster support, including a dash to Toronto. For Nagle, who spent much of his year as a trader, the salesman lifestyle comes naturally.",
			"In an interview with Bloomberg last month, Nagle said it goes without saying that his employees travel on a weekend to optimize their time during the week.",

			"Outgoing Mayor Franziska Giffey's center-left Social Democrats have led Berlin since 2001. They took much of the blame for the 2021 election chaos. Many Berliners also are angry over rising housing costs and that the city in recent years has had a dysfunctional bureaucracy, by German standards, in which getting basic paperwork done often entails lengthy waits.",

			"The decision to become the CDU's junior partner drew significant criticism in the party's ranks. Giffey said she was “very relieved” by the outcome of the ballot and promised to take dissenters' concerns seriously.",
			"Giffey is expected to take a ministerial job under Wegner, whose government will face pressure to produce results quickly. It will only serve out the term that started with Berlin's September 2021 election. The next state vote is due in late 2026.",
			"At national level, Scholz leads a three-party coalition of the Social Democrats, Greens and pro-business Free Democrats. The CDU leads the opposition. Germany's 16 states, which have significant powers in many policy areas, have governments of many different political complexions."

			"Biden and the Democratic-controlled Senate are likely to reject the proposal, but McCarthy has called it a basis for negotiations between the two parties in the coming weeks. Failure to raise the debt ceiling would lead to a U.S. default on its financial obligations, shaking the global economy.",

			"\"I cannot imagine someone in our conference that would want to go along with Biden's reckless spending,\" McCarthy told Fox News in an interview on Sunday.",

			"\"The conversation should be underway, but it should be on the budget resolution, and on the appropriations process and entitlement reform, if that's part of the agenda. That should all be separate from the question of the debt ceiling. Don't default, avoid default,\" Durbin told NBC News.",

			"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street traders are ignoring warning signs that the rally in technology stocks looks overblown.",
			"Optimism that the Federal Reserve will pivot from its most aggressive interest-rate hiking cycle in four decades – a major headwind for the industry last year – has pushed the S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Index up 19% in 2023 compared with a 7.7% gain for the S&amp;P 500 Index. That’s info tech’s strongest start to a year relative to the S&amp;P 500 since 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Last month alone, the sector beat the broader gauge by the most in two decades.",
			"One valuation model, however, shows the euphoria has gone too far.",
			"Tech stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are trading at almost 25 times prospective earnings. To justify such a multiple, the Fed would need to cut rates by at least 300 basis points, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show. That’s more than five times what the swaps market is pricing in for rate cuts this year.",
			"“Traders are betting on a big about-face in the Fed’s interest-rate policy, but there is no certainty as to whether, and when, this will happen,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial. “Longer-term, the sector’s growth prospects are attractive, but not at the current valuations.”",
			"A bleak earnings outlook for tech companies supports the skepticism. Analysts expect a 15% slump in the sector’s first-quarter profits — the third-largest decline among the S&amp;P 500’s 11 industry groups, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show.",
			"Tech bulls have been emboldened by the possibility that the Fed is close to ending its rate hikes, pushing S&amp;P 500 tech stocks to their best first quarter since 1998. A big chunk of those gains happened in March, when chaos in the US banking system sent traders flocking to cash-rich tech names in search of safety.",
			"Five stocks broadly defined as megacap high-flyers — Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. — have been responsible for two-thirds of the S&amp;P 500’s advance this year. Microsoft is due to report results this week.",
			"Options traders, however, aren’t as optimistic as equities investors. The cost of contracts protecting against a 10% decline in the Invesco QQQ Trust, the largest exchange-traded fund tracking the Nasdaq 100 Index, is now 1.7 times more than the cost of options that profit from a 10% rally. That’s the most in a year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.",
			"Strategists at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Morgan Stanley agree with options traders that the tech rally looks unsustainable.",
			"Read more: Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says Tech Stock Rally Is Overdone",
			"Technology stocks have been on a wild ride since the central bank began raising rates in March 2022 — tumbling for most of last year and then aggressively rebounding to start this one. Fed officials lifted interest rates by a quarter percentage point last month, bringing their policy benchmark to a target range of 4.75% to 5%. Swaps linked to the Fed anticipate around 57 basis points of cuts this year, taking the policy rate from an expected peak of 5.12% in June to 4.55% in December.",
			"None of this is written in stone, of course, particularly with inflation still well above the Fed’s target. Strategists at Wells Fargo Investment Institute and BNP Paribas SA say the rate cuts won’t materialize until early 2024.",
			"Read more: Fed’s Logan Says Inflation Too High, Outlines Measures to Watch",
			"“This Fed very badly wants to avoid compounding their initial mistake of calling inflation transitory, by now declaring it dead prematurely,” Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said in an email. “So if anything, they may stay hawkish too long, as opposed to quickly pivoting to cuts. That’s an underappreciated risk in markets.”",
			"However, history says there still may be more upside left. During the past four rate-hiking cycles going back to the mid-1990s, tech stocks have posted an average annualized return of 21%, according to Strategas Securities data. So far in this rate-hiking cycle, the S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Index is up just 1% and being beaten by several other sectors.",
			"“Investors now see current hikes as nearing an end after a very aggressive hiking cycle,” said Todd Sohn, managing director of technical strategy at Strategas. “That’s helped underpin the rally in tech shares this year.”",

For example, interacting with NPCs. We have a feature in Dead Island 2 called zombie goading or zombie taunting, where you can call the zombies to you, and then slash them up.

			"The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, reported late Saturday that geolocated footage from pro-Kremlin military bloggers indicated that Ukrainian troops had established a foothold near the town of Oleshky, along with “stable supply lines” to their positions.",
			"Analysts widely believe that if Ukraine goes ahead with a spring counteroffensive, a major goal would be to break through the land corridor between Russia and the annexed Crimean Peninsula, which would necessitate crossing the Dnieper River in the country's south.",
			"Responding to Ukrainian media reports proclaiming that the establishment of such positions indicated the counteroffensive had begun, Natalia Humeniuk, the spokeswoman for Ukraine’s Operational Command South, called for patience.",
			"While neither confirming nor denying the ISW report, she said only that details of military operations in the Dnieper delta couldn't be disclosed for operational and security reasons.",
			"Speaking on Ukrainian television, Humeniuk added that it was “very difficult work” when “it’s necessary to overcome an obstacle such as the Dnieper, when the front line passes through a wide and powerful river.”",
			"The Kremlin-installed head of the Kherson region, one of four parts of Ukraine that Russia said it was illegally annexing in September, denied on Sunday that Ukrainian forces have established a foothold on the east bank of the Dnieper.",

			"KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) — The number of tourists flocking to Jamaica’s sun-drenched beaches soared nearly 100% in the first three months of the year, causing long queues and hours-long waits for arriving passengers at the island's main airport.",
			"Tourism Minister Edmund Bartlett told The Associated Press that the problem stemmed from a shortage of airport staff to process the unexpected volume of people flying into Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay since the end of the pandemic.",
			"Bartlett told Parliament later that day that there were 1.18 million arrivals from January through March — 94% more than the same period of 2022 and a record high for Jamaica’s tourism high season.",
			"“The recovery has been stronger than anticipated and everybody all over the world is having difficulty with their airports because … (many) of the workers have not come back,” Bartlett said.",
			"He said authorities plan to spend more on technology as they strive to do away with paperwork at the airport, including ending a requirement for visitors to fill out a form upon arrival.",
			"Prime Minister Andrew Holness said the problems at Sangster underscore the need to push through the $70 million modernization and expansion project that already was underway.",
			"The work is scheduled to be completed by 2025, and Honess said the improvements at the Caribbean’s largest and busiest airport \"will make Jamaica more attractive and make Jamaica more competitive with other countries in the region, which have also invested heavily in improving their infrastructure.”",
			"As part of the project, the runway is being lengthened at a cost of $34 million, work that is expected to be finished in June.",
			"“We are excited about the prospects of Sangster being able to accommodate these mega airlines that will be flying to Jamaica and the Caribbean,” Bartlett said during the AP interview last week.",
			"He said the Tourism Ministry’s growth plan aims to have the island draw 5 million visitors annually by 2025. That would be a 35% increase from Jamaica's peak of 3.7 million tourists in 2022.",
			"Bartlett said Asian and Middle Eastern countries are among new markets being targeted and the airport must be able to accommodate the larger aircraft that would be used on such long-haul flights.",
			"In 2019, before the pandemic, the airport processed 4.7 million passengers, including citizens and visitors. The number of tourists to Jamaica peaked at 3.7 million in 2022, 70% of whom used the Sangster gateway.",
			"Sangster is managed by MBJ Airports Ltd., a consortium 74.5% owned by a subsidiary of the Mexican airports operator Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico and the rest by Vantage Airport Group of Canada.",
			"The consortium, which has a 30-year concession that began in 2003, said it spent $287 million to improve the airport in the first 18 years of the deal.",
			"Among the improvements, the airport operator has expanded the immigration hall and departure lounge. The check-in area was recently outfitted with 60 self-service kiosks, with plans to install more, to reduce passenger processing and waiting times."

There needs to be real reform like a players association to support college athletes to have a place at the table.”",
			"Last year, there was a 146% increase in NIL deals with almost 2,000 deals made across 16 sports, according to <a class=\"link\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" data-ylk=\"slk:SponsorUnited;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://sponsorunited.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SponsorUnited</a>.",

			"Like the average American struggling to understand the building blocks for wealth, financial literacy is key for these college athletes. Unfortunately, financial education for college athletes has been left to states and individual schools to work out, to the detriment of athletes.",

			"“Despite the wealth of opportunity, it hasn’t taken long for student-athletes to quickly realize they face challenges they aren’t equipped to handle on their own,” Sandra L. Richards, president of Morgan Stanley’s Global Sports &amp; Entertainment Division, told Yahoo Finance. “This includes how to garner deals while playing a sport less popular than basketball or football, discerning what deals are worth their time, choosing a company that best represents their interests, and most importantly, how to negotiate a contract and understand the financial details of the deals.”",

			"“Only a small percentage of college athletes will go professional, so many are using the opportunity to monetize their name, image, and likeness to build generational wealth once their collegiate careers are over,” Richards said. “The money earned from NIL deals are helping their siblings go to college or homeownership for their family.”",

But even with that bigger-than-usual haul, the carmaker has been recognizing less deferred revenue than it’s forecast in regulatory filings. At $639 million, its projection for 2023 is the lowest in almost four years.",

The company may “pivot away” from the store closings if there’s a successful sale.",
			"Bed Bath &amp; Beyond estimated it had assets of $4.4 billion and total debt of $5.2 billion as of late November, according to a court filing. The number of creditors is between 25,001 and 50,000, with BNY Mellon having the biggest unsecured claim of $1.18 billion. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond’s chief financial officer, Holly Etlin, will serve as chief restructuring officer to manage the bankruptcy.",

Later that month, it received a default notice from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. after breaching terms on a credit line.",
			"The retailer received a last-minute lifeline from the hedge fund Hudson Bay Capital Management — a deal that would have given Bed Bath &amp; Beyond more than $1 billion under certain conditions. But the company failed to meet stock-price minimums, and the deal was terminated. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond then said it would sell more shares in an effort to stave off a filing.",

The plan, unveiled in August, was among the retailer’s latest comeback attempts as it struggled to keep up with e-commerce competitors and changing consumer shopping habits.",
			"In recent years, lagging performance has made the company an activist target. In 2019, shareholders forced a revamp of the company’s board and the removal of its chief executive officer, while activist investor Ryan Cohen launched a subsequent campaign in March that saw another CEO ousted after a board shakeup.",

Instead, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is largely responsible for its own undoing, according to suppliers, analysts and former managers and employees. For nearly a decade, the retailer’s leadership teams made decisions that pushed the company, little by little, toward the brink of financial collapse.",
			"Under longtime CEO Steve Temares, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond spent too much money and time acquiring companies, such as Cost Plus World Market in 2012 and Decorist in 2017, which ultimately flopped. Temares also spent billions of dollars to buy back shares.",

			"In 2019, former Target executive Mark Tritton took the helm of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond as it was losing market share and reporting a decrease in quarterly sales. To try to arrest that decline, he decided to produce more products in-house, which can help to cut costs if implemented effectively over time. But at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond the strategy ended up filling stores with too many unknown private-label products at the expense of well-known national brands.",
			"The retailer’s “fundamental flaw, I think, was around the merchandising decision” to pivot to private-label products, S&amp;P Global Ratings analyst Declan Gargan said in an interview. “Their core customer was not interested in that.”",
			"Shoppers retreated and sales plummeted. Earlier this year, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond was preparing to file for bankruptcy. But, to the astonishment of many suppliers and analysts, the retailer inked a complex eleventh-hour financing deal at the beginning of February to sell its shares to hedge fund Hudson Bay. The deal raised $360 million — far short of the $1 billion goal.",
			"Bankruptcy loomed large once again.",
			"Then, the retailer announced yet another last-ditch financing deal at the end of March. But this one didn’t have a hedge fund as an intermediary. This time, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had several weeks to sell $300 million in shares directly to investors. They were largely uninterested, though, and the stock price kept spiraling downward.",
			"‘Constant’ Dilution",
			"“The idea that you can continually support your company even in the face of constant dilution of your investors just isn’t a long-term, viable corporate-finance strategy,” said James Gellert, CEO of ratings firm Rapid Ratings. “Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had a seeming disregard for common equity holders.”",
			"The jobs of thousands of employees — and their retirement savings and severance pay — are on the line. There are, however, some winners amid the collapse of one of the largest home-goods retailers in the US.",
			"Companies that have been able to effectively pivot in recent years to compete against Amazon and other online giants have seen a pickup in demand. Target, Walmart, HomeGoods and Amazon itself have been beneficiaries, notes GlobalData analyst Neil Saunders. “The store closures and loss of traffic at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond,” he said, “is being spread fairly widely among a variety of retailers.”",

			"HELSINKI (AP) — The three Baltic states have strongly condemned comments by China’s envoy to France, who appeared to suggest in a recent French television interview that former Soviet republics aren't sovereign nations.",
			"The foreign ministers of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in separate announcements late Saturday deemed statements by Lu Shaye, China’s ambassador to France, as unacceptable.",
			"In a recent interview with the French news channel LCI, he was asked if he thought that the Crimean Peninsula belongs to Ukraine. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, a move that most of the world denounced as illegal.",
			"“That depends ... on how one perceives this problem,” the envoy told the broadcaster. “There’s the history. Crimea was at the beginning Russian, no? It was (Soviet leader Nikita) Khrushchev who gave Crimea to Ukraine in the era of the Soviet Union.”",
			"When the channel's presenter noted that according to international law, Crimea is part of Ukraine, the Chinese ambassador drew a parallel to the former Soviet republics — including the three Baltic nations — that broke free after the USSR collapsed in 1991.",
			"“With regards to international law, even these ex-Soviet Union countries, they do not, they do not have the status — how to say it? — that’s effective in international law, because there is no international agreement to solidify their status as a sovereign country,\" he said.",

			"His Estonian counterpart, Margus Tsahkna, said Chinese ambassador's comments were “false and a misinterpretation of history,” while Latvian Foreign Minister Edgar Rinkevics said that the statements were “completely unacceptable.\"",
			"Tallinn, Riga and Vilnius would each summon China’s ambassador or representative for an explanation of the envoy’s comments, the three Baltic countries said. European Union and NATO members Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania regained their independence in 1991 amid the fall of the Soviet Union after nearly five decades of Moscow’s rule.",
			"In a separate statement, France’s Foreign Ministry expressed concern about the ambassador’s comments about ex-Soviet states and said: “It’s for China to say whether these comments reflect its position, which we hope is not the case.”",
			"The French ministry said these countries gained independence “after decades of oppression” and that in the specific case of Ukraine, “the entirety of the international community, including China,” recognized its borders, including Crimea, when it declared independence in 1991.",

It was the most-watched media libel case in decades.",
			"Fox had about $4 billion of cash on hand as of December 2022, and MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman expects the company to pay the settlement during the current quarter.",
			"How much the lawsuit will actually end up costing Fox is unclear because there are ways it can defray some of the expense, primarily through insurance and the use of tax deductions.",
			"Fox can deduct the Dominion settlement from its income taxes as an expense necessary for the cost of doing business. Fox Chief Communications Officer Brian Nick has confirmed the deductibility of the settlement.",
			"Big companies often deduct large settlements to help offset some of the cost, but since settlement amounts are usually confidential, it's difficult to pin down exactly how much they benefit. Payments that are seen as restitution or compensation can be deducted, while payments made to the government or at the direction of a government are usually not deductible.",
			"Robert Willens, a tax professor at the Columbia University School of Business, estimates that after the tax write-off, Fox will incur about three-fourths of the settlement amount, about $590 million.",
			"“The key is that if the payments are being made to private parties and not at the behest of the government then you can pretty much conclude without any fear of contradiction that the payment will be deductible,\" he said.",
			"A study by the <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Government Accountability Office in 2005;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-05-747.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Government Accountability Office in 2005</a> found that of 34 settlements totaling over $1 billion, 20 companies reported deducting some portion or all of their settlement payments. Big banks such as Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase reportedly also deducted portions of their settlements of charges tied the financial crisis of 2008.",
			"Also, if Fox is insured, insurance is likely to cover some of the settlement. Chad Milton, a partner at Media Risk Consultants, said a large media company such as Fox could have anywhere between $100 million to $500 million in coverage, including media liability insurance and other types of insurance.",
			"“It’s not hard to stack up $100 million but as you go higher than that, it gets harder and harder,” Milton said.",
			"Usually, there’s a certain amount a media company has to pay, which could be in the millions, before insurance kicks in. However, the deductible incudes attorney fees, which in a high-profile case like Fox-Dominion could be tens of millions of dollars or higher, so the deductible could be swallowed up just by attorney fees.",
			"One wrinkle: even if an insurance company pays a substantial part of the settlement, there could be an annual aggregate limit of liability, which could mean that insurers wouldn’t cover another big-money settlement.",
			"And media companies and insurers don’t always agree on who should cover what, since there are caveats written into contracts that allow insurers to avoid paying under certain circumstances. In 2017, Disney settled a defamation suit that was filed in 2012 after ABC aired a segment that questioned the safety of a meat producer’s products that critics dubbed “pink slime.” But one of its insurers, AIG, ended up suing Disney so it wouldn’t have to pay part of the settlement, although AIG eventually lost.",
			"Fox has also said it doesn’t expect the settlement to affect its operations.",
			"“We don’t expect significant operational effects or changes to our business given our cash flow, strong balance sheet and the health of our business,” the company said in a statement after the settlement was announced.",
			"MoffettNathanson's Fishman said everything indicates the company will be able to run its business as usual.",
			"“It isn’t clear there has been much, if any, impact of these lawsuits on Fox News’ viewership and business,” he said.",
			"Fishman said he doesn’t expect the settlement to hamper Fox’s ability to return money to shareholders, including a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program announced in February.",
			"Fox has a similar lawsuit looming with another voting machine company, Smartmatic, but no date has been set and the case might not go to court for a couple of years.",

			"April 23 (Reuters) - Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said on Sunday that if the G7 moved to ban exports to Russia, Moscow would respond by terminating the Black Sea Grain deal that enables vital exports of grain from Ukraine.",
			"The Group of Seven (G7) countries are considering a near-total ban on exports to Russia, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported last week, citing Japanese government sources. Russia has repeatedly threatened to scrap its participation in the grain deal, which is due to expire on May 18.",
			"\"This idea from the idiots at the G7 about a total ban of exports to our country by default is beautiful in that it implies a reciprocal ban on imports from our country, including categories of goods that are the most sensitive for the G7,\" Medvedev said in a post on his Telegram channel.",
			"\"In such a case, the grain deal - and many other things that they need - will end for them,\" he added.",
			"The G7 is reportedly discussing reversing its sanctions approach so that exports to Russia are automatically banned unless they are included on a designated list of products allowed to be shipped to the country. Under the current framework, goods are allowed to be sold to Russia unless they are explicitly black-listed.",
			"Medvedev, a long-time ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, is Putin's deputy chair at the influential Security Council and heads a government commission on arms production for the war in Ukraine.",
			"Moscow has repeatedly rallied against the terms of the Black Sea grain deal - the only significant diplomatic breakthrough of the 14-month conflict in Ukraine. It has said it will walk away from the initiative ahead of a May 18 deadline if the West does not lift restrictions on Russian agricultural and fertiliser exports.",
			"The G7 called on Sunday for the \"extension, full implementation and expansion\" of the deal to export Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea, the group's agriculture ministers said in a communique. (Reporting by Jake Cordell; Editing by Hugh Lawson and Susan Fenton)"

			"NEW YORK (AP) — Bed Bath &amp; Beyond — one of the original big box retailers known for its seemingly endless offerings of sheets, towels and kitchen gadgets — filed for bankruptcy protection, following years of dismal sales and losses and numerous failed turnaround plans.",
			"The beleaguered home goods chain made the filing Sunday in U.S. District Court in New Jersey and said it will start an orderly wind down of its operations, while seeking a buyer for all or some of its businesses. In the bankruptcy filing, the retailer said it anticipates closing all of its stores by June 30.",
			"For now, the company's 360 Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stores and its 120 Buy Buy Baby sites as well as its websites will remain open to serve customers.",
			"It listed estimated assets and liabilities in the range of $1 billion to $10 billion. The move comes after the company failed to secure funds to stay afloat.",
			"In a statement, the company, based in Union, New Jersey, said it voluntarily made the filing \"to implement an orderly wind down of its businesses while conducting a limited marketing process to solicit interest in one or more sales of some or all of its assets.\"",
			"The store closings will put thousands of jobs at risk. The company employed 14,000 workers, according to the court filing. That's drastically down from the 32,000 as of February 2022.",
			"Bed Bath &amp; Beyond said it secured a commitment of roughly $240 million in financing from Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc. to allow it to keep operating during the bankruptcy process.",
			"“It's the death of an icon. A lot of people have grown up with it, ” said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. “It’s an institution in retailing, but unfortunately being an institution doesn’t protect you from financial woes.”",
			"Founded in 1971, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had for years enjoyed its status as a big box retailer that offered a vast selection of sheets, towels and gadgets unmatched by department store rivals. It was among the first to introduce shoppers to many of today’s household items like the air fryer or single-serve coffee maker, and its 15% to 20% coupons were ubiquitous.",
			"But for the last decade or so, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond struggled with weak sales, largely because of its messy assortments and lagging online strategy that made it hard to compete with the likes of Target and Walmart, both of which have spruced up their home departments with higher quality sheets and beddings. Meanwhile, online players like Wayfair have lured customers with affordable and trendy furniture and home décor.",
			"In late 2019, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond tapped Target executive Mark Tritton to take the helm and turn around sales. Tritton quickly reduced coupons and started to introduce store label brands at the expense of national labels, a strategy that proved disastrous for the retailer.",
			"And the pandemic, which happened shortly after his arrival, forced the retailer to temporarily close its stores. It was never able to use the health crisis to pivot to a successful online strategy as others had, analysts said. And while many retailers were grappling with supply chain issues a year ago, Bed Bath was among the most vulnerable, missing many of its 200 best-selling items including kitchen appliances and personal electronics, during the holiday 2021 season.",
			"The retailer ousted Tritton in June 2022 after two back-to-back quarters of disastrous sales. In recent months, the company, under the stewardship of recently appointed president and CEO Sue Grove, went back to its original strategy of focusing on national brands, instead of pushing its own store labels. But the company has had a hard time having suppliers commit to delivering merchandise because of the retailer’s financial woes.",
			"This past holiday season, the stores were missing many key items, and it lost many customers, a problem that continued to plague the retailer through the winter and spring seasons.",
			"The bankruptcy filing comes as the company’s shares have tumbled even more as speculation of an impending bankruptcy filing increased. Its financial performance has also deteriorated. In late March, it noted that preliminary results showed anywhere from a 40% to 50% decline in sales at stores opened at least a year for the quarter ended Feb. 25.",
			"The company also said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in late March that it planned to sell $300 million worth of shares to avoid bankruptcy filing.",
			"The home goods retailer had been issuing several warnings about a potential bankruptcy filing since early this year. In late January, it noted in a government filing it was in default of its <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:loans;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/bankruptcy-business-2fd56f01b26c8484e2b30230cb439e4e\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">loans</a> and didn’t have the funds to repay what it owes. The company had said the default is forcing the company to look at various alternatives including restructuring its debt in bankruptcy court.",
			"Bed Bath &amp; Beyond joins a growing list of retailers that have filed for bankruptcy so far this year including party supplies chain <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:Party City;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/inflation-new-york-city-party-holdco-inc-business-bankruptcy-6103152baf9d5d633fb5adc167d0046c\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Party City</a> and <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:David’s Bridal;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/davids-bridal-bankruptcy-filing-wedding-ace0eadbedadc97337b8c50213e73bca\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">David’s Bridal</a>. The bankruptcy could offer a window of what's to come in the retail industry, given the changing landscape and the increasing challenges in the U.S. economy.",
			"During the depths of the pandemic, a number of retailers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy including Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney. But in 2022, there was a respite in retail bankruptcy filings as shoppers, flush with government stimulus money and a pile of savings, spent with abandon, helping to lift all types of retailers. But as credit tightens and inflation remains stubborn, shoppers have been tightening their purse strings in recent months, leaving struggling retailers like Bed Bath &amp; Beyond more vulnerable.",
			"Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had been trying to turn around its business and slash costs after the previous management’s new strategies worsened a sales slump. The company announced last August it would <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:close;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/stock-offerings-chewy-inc-6af2d83aec7cde2cd7b0706b892a4c0c\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">close</a> about 150 of its namesake stores and slash its workforce by 20%. It also lined up more than $500 million of new financing.",
			"Bed Bath &amp; Beyond’s shares, which were trading at distressed levels, have also been on a turbulent run. It made a monstrous run from $5.77 to $23.08 in a little more than two weeks in August. The trading was reminiscent of last year’s meme-stock craze, when out-of-favor companies suddenly became darlings of smaller-pocketed investors.",
			"But the stock fell back to Earth after Ryan Cohen, the billionaire co-founder of online pet-products retailer Chewy Inc. who purchased a nearly 10% stake in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond last March, sold off all his shares.",
			"Shares were hovering close to 30 cents in the past few days. A year ago, shares were trading at around $17.",
			"Bed Bath &amp; Beyond said it expects to process returns and exchanges in accordance with its usual policies until May 24 for items purchased prior to Sunday. It also anticipates gift cards, gift certificates and loyalty certificates will be accepted through May 8.It will stop accepting coupons on Wednesday.",

			"ATLANTA (Reuters) - As economists and investors scour data on inflation, jobs, housing, banking and other bellwether indicators to determine whether the United States is headed for a recession, a visit to the nation’s largest food-bank warehouse offers some ominous clues.",
			"More than half of the shelves at the Atlanta Community Food Bank are bare, in part because of supply-chain issues, but mostly because demand for food assistance is as high as it was during the COVID-19 pandemic, the nonprofit’s executives said. They said two in five people seeking food assistance in the Atlanta region this year have not done so before.",
			"“Nobody anticipated this,” said Debra Shoaf, chief financial officer of the private charity, which relies on corporate and individual donations, as well as government grants, to distribute food to the hungry in 29 Georgia counties. Shoaf, who also serves on the finance steering committee for the national charity Feeding America, says she’s hearing similar reports across the United States. “We’re back up to pandemic levels,” she said.",
			"In some regions, demand is exceeding even the starkest days of the COVID pandemic. In central Ohio, the local food bank says the number of households seeking aid has increased by nearly half since last year.",
			"More than 11.4 million households collected free groceries in early April, up 15% from a year ago, according to data from the Census Bureau.",
			"“Food banks have been around for 50 years, but this is the first time we are seeing unprecedented high food demand combined with historically low unemployment rates,” said Vince Hall, chief government relations officer for Feeding America, which supports 60,000 food pantries.",
			"The sustained demand comes as most government pandemic emergency aid ends - notably, temporary COVID-related increases to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamps, a federal program that provides debit cards to directly purchase food at stores.",
			"Inflation is a major factor, too: Grocery prices have increased 23% since March 2020, when the pandemic began, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",

			"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government may soon require natural gas-fired power plants to install technology to capture carbon emissions, sources said, as President Joe Biden's administration enacts new rules to help decarbonize the power sector in 12 years.",
			"The Environmental Protection Agency as soon as this week is expected to unveil standards for new and existing power plants, which belch roughly a quarter of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, two sources said. The rules will replace former President Donald Trump's American Clean Energy rule and former President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan, both of which were invalidated by courts.",
			"More than a year in the making, the standards should be based on a plant's potential to reduce emissions through carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, according to clean air law experts and industry representatives in talks with the EPA.",
			"Utility companies may need to decide whether they want to build new baseload gas plants with CCS technology or zero-emission renewable energy. States would develop plans for bringing their plants into compliance.",
			"\"These standards could level the playing field between new gas plants and new renewable energy,\" said Thomas Schuster, head of the Sierra Club's Pennsylvania chapter. Most new gas plants currently do not pay for emitting carbon, so the rules could make it harder for them to compete with solar and wind power.",
			"Biden has pledged that the power business will decarbonize by 2035. According to the Clean Air Act, the standards must be based on “best system of emission reduction,” technologies deemed affordable and technically feasible.",
			"The proposal will reflect two major developments to ensure the rules are legally defensible. One, a Supreme Court decision last July, barred EPA from forcing a system-wide shift in electric generation but allowed it to issue plant-specific rules.",
			"Second, the Inflation Reduction Act created tax credits making carbon capture and hydrogen more affordable and affirmed EPA's authority to regulate power plants. The law offers more than $100 billion in clean electricity tax incentives, including a 70% increase in credits for each ton of carbon captured and sequestered.",
			"\"If you're building a new fossil [plant], it needs to control its emissions, said Lissa Lynch, director of the federal legal group at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Existing technology can capture and store approximately 90% of carbon emissions, Lynch said.",
			"EPA could set varying standards for plants, applying stringent measures for ones that run constantly and easier ones for \"peaker\" plants which run during high power demand, Lynch said.",
			"CLEANER POWER",
			"U.S. Energy Information Administration figures show fossil fuels accounted for more than 60% of U.S. electricity generation in 2022, with 60% of that coming from gas and 40% from coal. Renewables accounted for 21.5%, with nuclear energy making up the rest.",
			"The EIA projected that this year, 54% of new generation (21GW) will be solar and 14% will be natural gas (7.5GW).",
			"Federal utility TVA has the most planned gas capacity at 5GW followed by investor-owned Duke Energy with 3 GW planned.",
			"TVA's portfolio in the coming decades will include carbon-free sources \"and sources like natural gas that complement that diversity without sacrificing rates or reliability\", a spokesperson said.",
			"Duke plans for natural gas to be part of its mix but \"operated less as baseload generation and as more of a peaking/ramping resource over time to balance out the variability in renewable resources\", a spokesperson said.",
			"Some industry representatives signaled in comments to the EPA last year that they do not think power plant standards should be based on carbon capture and storage, with the National Mining Association saying it is not an \"adequately tested technology.\" The group cited failure of a Texas project called Petra Nova that was mothballed in 2020.",
			"Utility Southern Company , which is phasing out its large fleet of coal generation, said new gas turbines should be favored \"to safeguard electric needs of the U.S.\".",
			"Southern, which also runs the National Carbon Capture Center with the Department of Energy, said commercial deployment of carbon capture technology \"is many years away\" despite the cost-reduction potential of the Inflation Reduction Act.",

			"(Bloomberg) -- Norway and Sweden are no longer the place to go for currency investors hunting richer returns in Europe.",
			"The Nordic nations’ comparatively high interest rates and slow inflation made them a carry-trade favorite in quiet times when demand for riskier wagers was strong. Investors borrowed in low-rate currencies like the euro and Swiss franc and used the money to buy the Norwegian krone and the Swedish krona.",
			"But stubborn inflation means the European Central Bank’s interest rates are poised to match, or even overtake, Nordic ones for only the second time in the history of the common currency — and the krone and krona are losing their luster.",
			"Norway’s currency has been the worst performer among G-10 peers so far this year. Sweden’s is trading near its lowest level on record. Their moves haven’t been aligned with a key volatility gauge since the end of 2022, underscoring how the currencies no longer benefit when risk appetite is high.",
			"Other than jawboning the currencies stronger, there’s little central bankers in Oslo and Stockholm can do without hurting their economies. In Sweden they’re stymied by one of the worst housing crises on the continent, and the risk that aggressive rate hikes would tip its economy into recession as mortgages are pushed out of the reach of millions of households.",
			"“There is certainly a risk both currencies continue to soften given the yield advantage has depleted,” said Dominic Bunning, head of European currency research at HSBC. “If the ECB’s hawkishness outlasts or overpowers that of the Riksbank or Norges Bank it will make it harder for the krone and krona to recover.”",
			"Even if the Swedish central bank raises rates by half a percentage point as estimated for its meeting this week — then hikes by a final quarter point to 3.75% — it will have merely matched the peak level predicted for the ECB. Markets are pricing the possibility of a similar terminal rate for the Norges Bank, according to SEB.",
			"The picture is grimmer with inflation factored in. While the official rates converge, real interest rates are negative 3.5% in Norway and negative 7.6% in Sweden, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That puts them below the euro area’s negative 3.4%.",
			"The narrowing rates gap, combined with a weak economic outlook, means both currencies could drop to about 12 per euro this year, strategists at Nomura Holdings Inc say. The krone fell for a sixth day against the euro on Friday, ending the week down 1.8% at 11.6317. The krona was up 0.4% at 11.3153.",
			"“The krone weakening looks excessive of what can be explained by commodity prices alone,” Magne Ostnor, a strategist at DNB Bank ASA wrote in a note Friday. “The backdrop also matters, the krone is no longer a high-yielding currency.”",
			"Iain Cunningham, portfolio manager at Ninety One UK Limited says Sweden is “particularly vulnerable” and is positioned against the krona in favour of the Swiss franc.",
			"Both the Riskbank and the Norges Bank have spoken out against currency weakness. The Swedish central bank vowed to thwart traders betting against the krona in its last policy review in February, while the Norges Bank blamed the krone’s fall to a two-year low as a reason for hiking rates further, according to its statement last month.",
			"According to Kamal Sharma, director of G10 currency strategy at Bank of America, the messaging is the “last resort” for the central banks as their currencies lose the advantage of high rates versus those of the euro-zone.",
			"With the risk — especially for the Riksbank — of raising rates so far they hobble the economy, both central banks may have to simply put up with weaker currencies until the ECB ends its tightening run.",

			"TOKYO, April 23 (Reuters) - Cheering, flag-waving crowds gathered in Tokyo on Sunday for the first full Pride parade in four years, celebrating advances in LGBTQ rights but demanding Japan join other advanced nations in legally recognising same-sex marriage.",
			"Change is slow in Japan, which hosts a summit next month of the Group of Seven industrial powers as the only member of the G7 that does not recognise same-sex marriage.",
			"But growing support from the nation's top business lobby and major companies is putting pressure on the government of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and his conservative ruling party.",
			"Organisers estimated 10,000 people marched in Sunday's parade in the downtown Shibuya district. Participants said they realised how their nation lagged the rest of the G7 but were hopeful of change.",
			"\"Japan is really far behind ... We will fight until the entire country has same-sex marriage,\" said Himama, sporting a pink-dyed goatee and declining to give his real name out of consideration for family members.",
			"\"I think the government is both pretending to see us and pretending not to, but that change will really start happening from here on in.\"",
			"Masako Mori, a special advisor to Kishida on LGBTQ affairs, attended, but did not mention same-sex marriage in brief remarks before the parade began, instead urging \"greater understanding of LGBTQ.\"",
			"Crowds lined the sidewalks, waving rainbow flags and shouting \"Happy Pride\" at marchers, who included a group from Taiwan - the only Asian nation with same-sex marriage.",
			"Since the last pre-pandemic Pride parade in 2019, the number of Japanese municipalities allowing same-sex couples to enter partnership agreements has surged from 26 to around 300, covering some 65% of the population. These do not allow partners to inherit each other's assets and deny them parental rights to each other's children. Hospital visits are not guaranteed.",
			"Kishida in February sacked an aide who sparked outrage by saying people would flee Japan if same-sex marriage was allowed, but the premier remains noncommittal about same-sex marriage, even as polls show some 70% of the public in favour.",
			"\"Circumstances in each country are different, and I believe it is important to proceed with discussions carefully,\" Kishida told a foreign media roundtable on Thursday.",
			"Japan's constitution refers to marriage as being between \"both sexes\" and mentions \"the equal rights of husband and wife\". Allowing same-sex marriage would require amending the civil code.",
			"Some lawmakers have vowed to pass a law promoting \"understanding of LGBTQ\" before the summit. Activists and business leaders say this is a good step but falls short, noting that Japan at last year's G7 summit committed to ensuring equal rights and anti-discrimination measures for LGBTQ.",
			"Masakazu Tokura, head of the powerful Keidanren business lobby, said in March he found the gap between Japan and other countries on LGBTQ issues \"embarrassing\" during a trip to the U.S.",
			"The situation has long limited the talent pool for global firms, but even traditional Japanese companies now find their international competitiveness endangered without diversity, including LGBTQ rights.",
			"\"Basically all the debates would be by Japanese men, and that made it hard to grow as a global firm,\" said Chika Sato, chief diversity officer at NEC.",
			"Foreign sponsors dominated the early days of Tokyo Pride, but this year's roster includes Japanese firms from Panasonic and manufacturer IHI to Japan Post and Mitsubishi Materials.",
			"\"Conservative politicians' idea of traditional family may be hard to change, but the idea of boosting Japan's economy will definitely resonate,\" said Takeharu Kato, a member of the activist group \"Marriage for All Japan\" and a lawyer in a landmark 2021 case over LGBTQ marriage rights.",
			"NEC has in recent years promoted diversity in-house and grants LGBTQ couples some of the same benefits as married couples. Some 100 employees were scheduled to march in the parade. An NEC subsidiary is a sponsor, though not the parent company.",

		"content": [
			"WASHINGTON (AP) — The 155 mm howitzer round is one of the most requested artillery munitions of the war in Ukraine. Already the U.S. has shipped more than 1.5 million rounds to Ukraine, but Kyiv is still seeking more.",
			"A look at why this particular munition is so commonly used, and why it's been so critical to <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:the war in Ukraine.;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine?utm_source=apnewsnav&amp;utm_medium=featured\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the war in Ukraine.</a>",
			"WHAT IS THE 155 MM?",
			"Essentially, the 155 mm round is a very big bullet, made up of four parts: the detonating fuse, projectile, propellant and primer.",
			"Each round is about 2 feet (60 centimeters) long, weighs about 100 pounds (45 kilograms), and is 155 mm, or 6.1 inches, in diameter. They are used in howitzer systems, which are towed large guns that are identified by the range of the angle of fire that their barrels can be set to.",
			"The 155 mm shells can be configured in many ways: They can be packed with highly explosive material, use precision guided systems, pierce armor or produce high fragmentation.",
			"Past variants have included smoke rounds to obscure troop movement and illumination rounds to expose an enemy’s position.",
			"“The 155 mm round and the similar Soviet-era 152 mm rounds are so popular because they provide a good balance between range and warhead size,” said Ryan Brobst, a research analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. “If you have too small a shell, it won’t do enough damage and go as far. If you have a larger shell, you can’t necessarily fire it as far. This is the most common middle ground, and that’s why it’s so widely used.”",
			"155 MM HISTORY",
			"The French first developed the 155 mm round to respond to World War I's extensive trench warfare, and early versions included gas shells, Keri Pleasant, historian for the Army’s Joint Munitions Command, said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
			"As World War I continued, the 155 mm gun became the most common artillery piece used by the Allies, Pleasant said, and the U.S. Army later adopted it as its standard field heavy artillery piece.",
			"The U.S. military fielded its own version, the M1, for World War II. After the war, the new NATO alliance adopted the 155 mm as its artillery standard.",
			"By the Korean War, the round had been modified again, with a cluster munition variant. “The round contained 88 submunitions, which were dispersed over a wide area to destroy vehicles, equipment, and personnel,” Pleasant said.",
			"ITS USE IN UKRAINE",
			"Howitzer fires can strike targets up to 15 to 20 miles (24 to 32 kilometers) away, depending on what type of round and firing system is used, which makes them highly valued by ground forces to take out enemy targets from a protected distance.",
			"“Adversaries don’t have much warning of it coming. And it’s harder to hide from incoming rounds that are arcing in from the top, which makes it highly lethal,” Brobst said.",
			"In Ukraine, 155 mm rounds are being fired at a rate of 6,000 to 8,000 a day, said Ukrainian parliamentary member Oleksandra Ustinova, who serves on Ukraine’s wartime oversight committee. They are eclipsed by the estimated 40,000 Russian variant howitzer rounds fired at them, she told reporters at a recent Washington event sponsored by the German Marshall Fund.",
			"The Pentagon previously had said how many rounds it was providing in each of the security assistance packages being sent about every two weeks to keep weapons and ammunition flowing into Ukraine. But it stopped specifying the number of 155 mm rounds shipped in each package in February, citing operational security.",
			"However, in its <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:overall count;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2023/Apr/04/2003192566/-1/-1/1/UKRAINE-FACT-SHEET-APR-4.PDF\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">overall count</a> of assistance provided to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022, the Pentagon says it has sent more than 160 155 mm howitzers, more than 1.5 million 155 mm rounds, more than 6,500 precision-guided 155 mm rounds and more than 14,000 155 mm Remote Anti-Armor Mine (RAAM) Systems — essentially a 155 mm shell packed with four mines that scatter on the ground and can take out a Russian tank if it drives over them.",
			"Other countries have also provided howitzers, but Kyiv has continually asked for more. As of last year Ukrainian officials were requesting <a class=\"link\" data-ylk=\"slk:as many as 1,000 howitzer systems;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-zelenskyy-nato-sergey-lavrov-dd7bc9324e465a15209940c146a859b3\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">as many as 1,000 howitzer systems</a> to push Russian forces back.",
			"SPRING OFFENSIVE",
			"As Ukraine prepares for an intense counteroffensive this spring, it will likely need to fire 7,000 to 9,000 155 mm shells a day, said Yehor Cherniev, a member of Ukraine's parliament who spoke to reporters at the German Marshall Fund event.",
			"In recent months, the Biden administration has been using presidential drawdown authority to send ammunition directly from U.S. military stockpiles to Ukraine, instead of having to wait and buy rounds from defense firms, so they can get there in time for the anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive.",
			"The U.S. has also been training Ukrainian troops in Germany on how to better use the 155 mm rounds in combined arms tactics — coordinating strikes with targeting information provided by forward-based troops and other armored systems to maximize damage and reduce the number of rounds needed to take out a target.",

The dwindling supply has alarmed U.S. military planners, and the Army now plans to spend billions on munitions plants around the country in what it calls its most significant transformation in 40 years.",
			"It may not be easy to adapt: practically every square foot of the Scranton plant's red brick factory buildings — first constructed more than a century ago as a locomotive repair depot — is in use as the Army clears space, expands production to private factories and assembles new supply chains.",
			"There are some things that Army and plant officials in Scranton won’t reveal, including where they get the steel for the shells and exactly how many more rounds this factory can produce.",

			"The rounds, used in howitzer systems, are critical to Ukraine’s fight because they allow the Ukrainians to hit Russian targets up to 20 miles (32 kilometers) away with a highly explosive munition.",
			"“Unfortunately, we understand that the production is very limited and it’s been more than a year of war,” Ukraine parliamentary member Oleksandra Ustinova said at a German Marshall Fund media roundtable in Washington on Monday. “But unfortunately we are very dependent on 155.”",
			"The Army is spending about $1.5 billion to ramp up production of 155 mm rounds from 14,000 a month before Russia invaded Ukraine to over 85,000 a month by 2028, U.S. Army Undersecretary Gabe Camarillo told a symposium last month.",
			"Already, the U.S. military has given Ukraine more than 1.5 million rounds of 155 mm ammunition, according to Army figures.",
			"But even with higher near-term production rates, the U.S. cannot replenish its stockpile or catch up to the usage pace in Ukraine, where officials estimate that the Ukrainian military is firing 6,000 to 8,000 shells per day. In other words, two days' worth of shells fired by Ukraine equates to the United States' monthly pre-war production figure.",
			"“This could become a crisis. With the front line now mostly stationary, artillery has become the most important combat arm,” said a January report by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
			"Currently, the metal bodies for the 155 mm shells are made at the Army's Scranton plant, operated by General Dynamics, and at a General Dynamics-owned plant in nearby Wilkes-Barre, officials say.",
			"Together, the plants are under contract for 24,000 shells per month, with an additional $217 million Army task order to further boost production, although officials won't say how many more 155 mm shells are sought by the task order.",
			"The Russians are firing 40,000 shells per day, said Ustinova, who serves on Ukraine's wartime oversight committee.",
			"“So we’re doing five times less than they do and trying to keep it up. But if we don’t start the production lines, if you don’t warm it up, it is going to be a huge problem,” Ustinova said.",
			"The obstacles the U.S. faces in ramping up production can be seen at the Scranton plant.",
			"The factory — built for the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad just after 1900, when the city was a rising coal and railroad powerhouse — has produced large-caliber ammunition for the military going back to the Korean War.",
			"But the buildings are on the National Historic Registry of Historic Places, limiting how the Army can alter the structures.",
			"Inside, the floor is crowded with piles of shells, defunct equipment and production lines where robotic arms, saws, presses and other machines cut, heat, forge, temper, pressure test, wash and paint the shells.",
			"The plant is in the midst of $120 million in modernization plans and the Army hopes to open a new production line there by 2025.",
			"Still, clearing space for it has been a complicated task while the military adds newer machinery to make existing lines more efficient.",
			"“There’s a lot going on,” said Richard Hansen, the Army commander’s representative at the plant.",
			"Meanwhile, the Army is expanding supply chains for parts — metal shells, explosive fill, charges that shoot the shell and fuses — and buying the massive machines that do the work.",
			"The Army has new contracts with plants in Texas and Canada to make 155 mm shells, said Douglas Bush, an assistant Army secretary and its chief weapons buyer. The U.S. is also looking overseas to allies to expand production, Bush said.",
			"Once the shells are finished in Scranton, they are shipped to the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant, where they are packed with explosives, fitted with fuses and packaged for final delivery.",

			"(Bloomberg) -- The global market for initial public offerings is showing signs of life as a rebound in the stock market has emboldened companies to test investor appetite for new listings, particularly in Asia. But a full-fledged recovery looks distant.",
			"Roughly $25 billion worth of IPOs priced globally in March and April, nearly twice the amount seen in the first two months of the year when listings virtually ground to a halt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.",
			"Issuers from Hong Kong to Milan saw a window of opportunity with the decline in market volatility, according to analysts. Activity was particularly buoyant in Asia, where regional exchanges accounted for nearly 80% of new share sales in April. Listings in Europe also picked up. But concern about a recession has deterred US issuers, slowing a full-fledged recovery. Deal sizes on average were smaller, and the money raised so far this year remains 51% below the same period last year.",
			"“We are beginning to see green shoots of activity with companies restarting processes that were on hold, but there is still a fair degree of uncertainty in the market,” said Jason Manketo, global co-head of law firm Linklaters’ equities practice. “The buy side is keen to see results for a couple of quarters before committing to an IPO. This means the potential pipeline of some 2023 deals has been moved out to 2024.”",
			"Asia Leads",
			"Drilling down into the data, Asia is handily the busiest area for offerings in the world right now. But in a key change compared to 2022 — when the vast majority of large-sized deals were concentrated in mainland China — issuance is coming from a broader swath of Asia this year.",
			"Indonesia has been the brightest spot with a pair of nickel producers surging in their debut. Rakuten Bank Ltd. soared after raising 83.3 billion yen ($623 million) in Japan’s largest IPO since 2018 — though, the pop came after the initial price range had been cut. And KKR &amp; Co.-backed Chinese liquor company ZJLD Group Inc. on Thursday priced Hong Kong’s largest offering of 2023.",
			"“The IPO market is coming back gradually and slowly. It is not 100% back yet, but there are signs of life and renewed vigor,” said James Wang, co-head of equity capital markets at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in Asia ex-Japan.",
			"Europe Wakes Up",
			"Europe’s IPO market has been moribund, with 2023 activity down about 12% from the same period last year when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine brought listings to a screeching halt.",
			"Poor IPO returns have been a major deterrent for investors. Portfolio managers have been driving hard bargains on valuations and refusing to pay top dollar for new, unproven companies. Plus, the sudden meltdown of Credit Suisse Group AG, which ignited a global market rout last month, has added to investor worries about interest rates and inflation, further muddying listing plans.",
			"But there have been signs of gloom lifting. Most notably, Lottomatica SpA, the Italian gambling company backed by Apollo Global Management Inc., opened books last week for a €600 million ($657 million) IPO, becoming the third large firm to tap European exchanges this year. Additionally, German web-hosting company Ionos SE and electric motor component maker EuroGroup Laminations SpA have managed to raise more than $400 million in the region, though both stocks have struggled after debuting.",
			"US Falling Behind",
			"Still, the outlook for IPOs in the US remains challenged. Only $4.1 billion has been raised for companies listing on US exchanges this year, with just three — Nextracker Inc., Atlas Energy Solutions Inc. and Enlight Renewable Energy Ltd. — accounting for a third of that amount.",
			"In fact, outside that cluster and a dozen SPACs that have debuted this year, the vast majority of new listings would be qualified as penny stocks.",
			"“We’re still in an uncertain world and uncertainty is the worst thing for new issuances,” said Greg Martin, co-founder of Rainmaker Securities, which facilitates secondary transactions for private companies.",
			"Evidence is mounting the US may be headed toward a recession and the Federal Reserve’s path forward on interest rates remains unclear.",
			"“How do you price a deal when you don’t know what the cost of capital really should be on a forward-looking basis,” said Patrick Galley, CEO &amp; CIO of RiverNorth Capital Management. “Some clarity over interest rates is key.”",

		"content": [
			"(Bloomberg) -- The Biden administration is preparing to propose limits on greenhouse gas emissions from coal- and gas-fired power plants that are so stringent they could almost wipe out the US electricity sector’s planet-warming pollution by 2040.",
			"The White House is in the final stages of reviewing a draft proposal from the Environmental Protection Agency, which would target both new and existing power plants — the second-biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US today. Details of the measure, some of which were previously reported by the New York Times, were described by people briefed on the plan.",
			"The proposal, which could be unveiled in coming days, is the EPA’s second attempt to clamp down on carbon dioxide released from power-plant smokestacks. The Supreme Court last year tossed out a sweeping Obama-era rule that sought to shift electricity generation from fossil fuels toward renewable sources.",
			"The new draft is smaller in scope, with a foundation built on changes that can be employed directly at power plants, including through efficiency gains known as heat-rate improvements, carbon-capture systems and the substitution of cleaner hydrogen for natural gas as a combustion source.",
			"The proposal would establish rate-based limits on pollution, built on the EPA’s assessment of the best system of emission reductions that can be employed at sites, the people said. To meet the requirements at existing facilities, many plant owners would be compelled to add carbon-capture systems or substitute hydrogen for some of their fuel. Plant closures also could help satisfy the limits.",
			"States and power plant owners would have flexibility in how they meet the requirements and time to employ the strategies — including many years for existing facilities, the people said.",
			"The measure would accelerate a power-sector shift toward renewable sources that’s already propelled by hundreds of billions of dollars in clean-energy incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act. It comes alongside newly proposed limits on carbon dioxide from car and truck tailpipes — and dovetails with other Biden administration efforts to meet a US promise to pare the country’s greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% by 2030.",
			"The EPA declined to comment on the details, citing a pending interagency review of the proposal.",
			"“We have been clear from the start that we will use all of our legally upheld tools, grounded in decades-old bipartisan laws, to address dangerous air pollution and protect the air our children breathe today and for generations to come,” the agency said in an emailed statement.",
			"Changing the Economics",
			"The electricity sector can now take advantage of expanded tax credits for renewable and nuclear power, hydrogen and carbon-capture operations.",
			"“We are going to set standards for greenhouse gas emissions in the power sector that reinforce the market trajectory and that reinforce our desire to get pole position on the shift to clean energy,” White House National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi said in a recent interview.",
			"“What’s possible in the power sector has changed dramatically as a result of technology cost curves and as a result of manufacturing availability,” Zaidi said. Paired with expanded tax credits, “that fundamentally, I think, changes the economics of what’s possible in the power sector.”",
			"It wasn’t immediately clear how the EPA intends to treat coal-fired power plants that are slated for retirement or what standard the agency might require for infrequently used facilities that can be summoned to generate electricity during demand spikes just a few days each year.",
			"Power utilities have lobbied the administration for compliance flexibility, arguing new rules should seek to preserve reliability. The Edison Electric Institute, which represents investor-owned electric companies, stressed in a filing that approach is necessary to drive cost-effective emission reductions.",
			"The EPA should “design standards for both new and existing units that achieve emissions reductions goals, are consistent with electric company clean energy commitments and support affordable and reliable electricity, which will be essential for customers and for larger economy-wide decarbonization efforts,” EEI said.",
			"Environmental advocates have encouraged the EPA to set a stringent standard based on very high carbon capture, utilization and sequestration systems — equivalent to a 90% emission reduction from combined-cycle gas power plants.",
			"“Emissions reductions of 90% are achievable for both coal-fired and gas-fired power plants,” the advocacy group Evergreen Action told the EPA in public comments. Even without new EPA rules, “many power companies are already considering installing CCUS.”",

That massive tailwind — enough to lop 50 basis points off the investment-grade risk premium — may soon become a huge drag as policymakers get back to quashing inflation, having extinguished the banking-sector fire.",
			"“With peak liquidity past, we would not be at all surprised if markets were now to experience a sudden pressure loss,” Matt King, Citi’s global markets strategist, wrote in a note. “Keep watching the liquidity data — and buckle up.”",
			"Corporate debt markets had the best first quarter since 2019, despite proliferating concerns about the economy as central banks kept raising interest rates. Credit extended the rally in recent weeks, erasing losses caused by banks collapsing.",
			"“We now expect almost all of them to stall or go into outright reverse,” King wrote in the note published April 18, referring to central banks shifting back to a tighter policy stance after the bank-spurred turmoil subsided. “This could subtract $600 billion-$800 billion in global liquidity in coming weeks, undermining risk in the process.”",
			"Read more: China Central Bank Hints It Will Dial Back Pandemic Stimulus",

			"Junk bonds are most likely to suffer from this reversal after swiftly recouping losses caused by the recent banking crisis. Despite robust demand for the debt, aided by relatively easy financial conditions, rates ratcheting higher and major economies like the US teetering on the brink of recession — or even stagflation — don’t bode well for highly-indebted borrowers.",

			"(Bloomberg) -- Bond traders are taking little solace in the market’s recent calm for a simple reason: It’s not likely to last.",
			"Two-year US Treasury yields, some of the most sensitive to expected changes in interest-rates, held in a relatively narrow range during the past week’s trading sessions, marking a reprieve from the volatility that erupted after Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse set off fears of a banking crisis.",
			"But the cross currents that have cast uncertainty over the market haven’t gone away. Traders have dialed up bets that the Fed could raise interest rates in both May and June, threatening to delay the central bank’s long-awaited pause. Angst is building that a political fight in Washington over the debt limit may not be resolved until the government’s on the cusp of a default. And the economic outlook has been muddied by the prospect that banks will dial back lending to bolster investors’ confidence.",
			"“The volatility has really been in the two-year note and it’s a function of the fact that the Fed and other central banks are breaking stuff,” said Gregory Faranello, head of US rates trading and strategy for AmeriVet Securities. “The Fed is trying to separate financial stability in the system and monetary policy — and I think that collides in May.”",
			"“I also really have the debt limit on my radar,” he added.",
			"The ICE BofA MOVE Index, which tracks expected swings in Treasuries as measured by one-month options, has tumbled nearly 40% since mid-March, when it hit the highest since 2008. This week, two-year Treasury yields, which swung from as much as 5.08% to as little as 3.55% in March, ended at just below 4.2%, up slightly on the week.",
			"Even so, swaps traders have ratcheted up the odds to about 20% that the Fed will follow a quarter-point hike in May with another such move in June. The reason: the economy is so far proving resilient and inflation seems still far from receding rapidly back to the central bank’s 2% target.",
			"The coming week will provide fresh insight into how much more work policymakers have to do to rein in price pressures with the release of the personal-consumption expenditures index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg is for the measure to have slowed in March to a 4.1% annual pace from 5% a month earlier. There won’t be any fresh public comments from Fed policymakers because officials are in their customary blackout period ahead of their May 2-3 meeting.",
			"While fear of a full-fledged banking crisis has ebbed since last month, the tightened credit conditions that have resulted are providing a headwind to growth. That has raised the specter of a slowly moving credit contraction that’s muddying the outlook for monetary policy and bond yields.",
			"“Where our concern lies is around the potential for a credit crunch — to really put restraint on the consumer,” said Michelle Girard, head of US at NatWest Markets on Bloomberg television. “You have a whole host of data that can tell a bunch of different stories. So no one can be confident, the Fed included, on exactly what the path will be – or what other events may happen to alter expectations.”",
			"While Girard expects a recession later this year as tighter monetary policy sinks in, she sees inflation staying over the Fed’s target, preventing them from cutting rates until 2024. That likely means 10-year Treasury yields “may take longer than some expect” to fall substantially further, given that swaps traders are still pricing in rate cuts later this year.",
			"Benchmark 10-year yields trade just below 3.6% — down from as much as 4.1% this year and around 60 basis points less than those on 2-year notes. The gap has narrowed since reaching as much as minus 111 basis points on March 8 — the deepest inversion since the early 1980s — as the failure of SVB and two other lenders fanned recession fears.",

			"According to the lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday in Fort Lauderdale, after Robert Jones died, his widow was given two choices by crew members.",
			"They allegedly told Marilyn Jones, then 78 and from the Florida Panhandle, that his body could be taken off at the next stop, Puerto Rico, or stored in the morgue until the ship got back to Fort Lauderdale in six days. Because passenger deaths sometimes happen, most large cruise ships have a morgue.",

			"In 2019, half of the 35 million older adults and younger persons with disabilities with traditional Medicare spent at least 16% of their income on out-of-pocket health care costs, according to the report. Overall, for the annual period reviewed, people with traditional Medicare spent an average of $6,663 on insurance premiums and medical services.",
			"The annual out-of-pocket medical expenditures that many older Americans face in retirement underscores the need for workers to double-down either on ways to cut those costs or tap every tool to save up enough to cover future health care bills that may be considerably higher than expected.",
			"“Contrary to a common belief, Medicare does not cover all health care–related expenses,” said Claire Noel-Miller, a senior strategic policy advisor at the AARP Public Policy Institute and writer of the report, who examined data from the 2019 Medicare Current Beneficiary <a class=\"link\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" data-ylk=\"slk:Survey;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/research/mcbs\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Survey</a>. “And costs can add up.”",
			"The main culprit for the pricey healthcare tab: no cap on the amount someone might shell out in yearly outlays for expenses not covered by Medicare.",
			"“Even though the program offers fairly comprehensive coverage, traditional Medicare does not have a maximum limit on what people have to spend out-of-pocket every year,” Noel-Miller told Yahoo Finance. “Consequently, some people with traditional Medicare can face high expenses, especially if they become ill and need more medical services.”",
			"That’s backed up by the report.",
			"One in 10 traditional Medicare beneficiaries spent 52% of their income on medical outlays. The same share with traditional Medicare spent at least $11,767 in 2019, and the top quarter of spenders paid an average of $15,449.",
			"Many Medicare beneficiaries purchase Medigap or enroll in Medicare Advantage plans to help offset these costs. They also enroll in Part D prescription drug plans. But the combination of premiums for supplement coverage and out-of-pocket expenses can put a significant financial stress on Medicare beneficiaries.",
			"The report “reflects something that’s been true about Medicare since the beginning, which is that the program provides broad coverage of needed medical services, but the benefits aren’t free and out-of-pocket costs aren’t capped in traditional Medicare,” Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the program on Medicare policy at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), told Yahoo Finance.",
			"“As health care costs, premiums, and Medicare cost-sharing requirements have increased over time, people in traditional Medicare have become more reliant on supplemental coverage to help cover the cost sharing that Medicare requires,” Cubanski said. “And a growing share are signing up for Medicare Advantage plans that are required to have an out-of-pocket cap.”",
			"Last year, nearly half (48%) of eligible Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans.",
			"One in five Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan pointed to a limit on out-of-pocket spending as the main reason for their choice, according to The Commonwealth Fund’s 2022 Biennial Health Insurance <a class=\"link\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" data-ylk=\"slk:Survey;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2022/oct/traditional-medicare-or-advantage-how-older-americans-choose\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Survey</a> of 1,605 adults enrolled in Medicare.",

			"People with traditional Medicare generally pay a monthly premium for physician coverage, Part B, and for prescription drug coverage, Part D. Those premiums vary by plan. Some people pay a monthly premium for inpatient hospital coverage, Part A.",
			"Each year the Medicare Part B premium, deductible, and coinsurance rates are reset. For 2023, the standard monthly premium for Medicare Part B — which covers physician services, outpatient hospital services, certain home health services, durable medical equipment, among other services not covered by Medicare Part A — is $164.90, according to the <a class=\"link\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" data-ylk=\"slk:Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/2023-medicare-parts-b-premiums-and-deductibles-2023-medicare-part-d-income-related-monthly\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services</a>.

There also is an addition to Part D premiums for higher-income beneficiaries. You will only pay extra for Part B or Part D if you earned more than $97,000 in modified adjusted gross income as an individual or more than $194,000 if you’re a joint filer.",
			"Out-of-pocket spending for health care also varies with beneficiaries’ socioeconomic characteristics, such as age, gender, race or ethnicity, and income level, the AARP Public Policy Institute analysis found. Total spending on premiums and health care services rises with age and is generally higher for women, white beneficiaries, and individuals with higher incomes, Noel-Miller said.",
			"As expected, the amount that people with traditional Medicare spend on health care also fluctuates based on how healthy they are.",
			"Out-of-pocket spending in 2019 for people with chronic conditions was notably higher, including congestive heart failure ($3,513), diabetes ($2,779), hypertension ($2,653), and high cholesterol ($2,601), according to the AARP report.",
			"“One thing that might surprise people is that Medicare doesn’t cover the cost of long-term care facility services, such as a long-term stay in a nursing home,” Cubanski said. “The high cost of these services can translate to tens of thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs for people who need this care, many of whom end up having to spend down all of their savings to qualify for coverage through Medicaid.”",
			"Long-term care facilities such as skilled nursing homes and assisted living facilities, which Medicare does not cover, are by far the most expensive category of out-of-pocket spending, according to the AARP breakdown. The average traditional Medicare beneficiary who stayed in such a facility in 2019 spent $25,395 out of pocket.",
			"Also adding to out-of-pocket costs was dental care ($938), clinicians’ services ($776), and prescription drugs ($774).",
			"“These costs not only surprise people, they shock and anger retirees,” Mary Johnson, a policy analyst for <a class=\"link\" data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" data-ylk=\"slk:The Senior Citizens League,;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://seniorsleague.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Senior Citizens League,</a> told Yahoo Finance. “Medicare is so complicated that the average person can’t be expected to anticipate these types of costs and that leaves retirees under-prepared for this big chunk of their retirement budget.”",
			"The Senior Citizens League’s latest survey results are similar to the AARP report.",
			"Six out of 10 of the 1,055 participants surveyed from mid-January 2023 through April 6, 2023 reported spending at least 16% of their income on Medicare in 2022. However, the findings did not differentiate between traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage.",
			"“While we don’t have an ‘average’ spending amount, our survey indicates that the median amount reported as health care cost spending for 2022 was about $4,800,” Johnson said. “Our survey also found that 1 in 5 survey participants reported spending more than $12,828 in 2022.”",
			"<strong>Options ‘to manage those costs’</strong>",
			"For future retirees who haven’t taken the time to absorb the potentially onerous costs that lie ahead, these reports should be eye-opening.",
			"“I’s important for people with Medicare to understand what they may have to spend out of pocket for their health care and what their options are to manage those costs,” Noel-Miller said.",
			"For example, there are<a class=\"link\" data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" data-ylk=\"slk:programs;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.medicareinteractive.org/get-answers/cost-saving-programs-for-people-with-medicare/medicare-savings-programs-qmb-slmb-qi/medicare-savings-program-basics\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> programs </a>that help people with limited resources pay for their premiums and cost-sharing, but many people who are eligible are not enrolled, she added.

To be eligible, though, you must be enrolled in a high-deductible health care plan.",
			"An HSA has a triple tax advantage for your retirement savings which is hard to ignore, according to Paul Fronstin, director of health benefits research at the <a class=\"link\" data-i13n=\"cpos:13;pos:1\" data-ylk=\"slk:Employee Benefit Research Institute;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0\" href=\"https://www.ebri.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Employee Benefit Research Institute</a> (EBRI). It lets you put money in on a tax-free basis and allows it to build up tax-free, and spend it tax-free for qualified health care expense",
			"One issue: Many workers aren’t using HSAs to their maximum benefit. Of the 13 million HSAs in the <a class=\"link yahoo-link\" data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\" data-ylk=\"slk:EBRI database;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/most-workers-arent-using-this-key-retirement-tool-to-the-fullest-192334678.html\">EBRI database</a>, only a fraction— 12% of the account holders— invested their HSAs in assets other than cash.",
			"“Even if you aren’t able to save in an HSA, save for health care costs in retirement anyway you can, as soon as you can,” Fronstin said.",
			"While that’s great advice, it’s not as easy as it sounds.",
			"“Something you often hear is a recommendation that people save more in their working years to provide a greater financial cushion for health care costs they might incur in their older years,” Cubanski said. “But that doesn’t recognize the financial reality that most people simply don’t have the means to save much of anything during their working years to meet their day-to-day needs, let alone needs they might have for health care in retirement.”",
			"As healthcare costs continue to rise, “there is no ready-made solution to the problem of high out-of-pocket costs,” she said.",
			"“A more comprehensive approach might be to fill these coverage gaps in Medicare to improve the financial protection that the program provides,\" she said, \"but doing so would be quite costly and there hasn’t been much appetite for the additional spending that would be required of the federal government.”",
